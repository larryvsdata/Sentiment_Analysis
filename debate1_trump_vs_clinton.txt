Donald trump is repeating the same things as if he's trying to reach the word count on an essay #debates
On not paying taxes "That makes me smart" Donald Trump Wow,(sigh)Hard working taxpaying Americans   #RealityCheck #debatenight #Debates2016
OH GOD WE ARE ON THE RACE QUESTION HERE WE GOOOO #debatenight
The best part about the #Debates are their facial expressions when the other is talking
Check out @FrankLuntz he has proof that Trump is winning this debate. #debatenight
Trump is literally Hillary's pinata right now. Her piano. She is playing him #debatenight
This debate is who can dodge the most ?'s &amp; get the last insult on each other. Reminds me when my brother &amp; I fought @ age  8 #Debates2016
No you're wrong! Can I have a real time fact check? #debates #innercity
Trump's existence doubles my apathy and cynical look to that whole universe. #debates
@LesterHoltNBC I truly love you but Mr. Trump should not be permitted 2 ignore u when u tell him he's out of time.  Bullying? #debatenight
Thanks @LesterHoltNBC for the follow up question on taxes, the IRS has cleared him, so what is the REAL reason @realDonaldTrump #debatenight
"You decided to stay home and that's ok." What the ever-loving f@$#. #Debates2016
Trump just said we need 'stop &amp; frisk' &amp; better relationships. A bit contradictory. #debatenight
African American? Excuse you but the people of color who were shot were American not African American. #debates
My dad is very upset rn, he just said "Shut the fuck up Trump you're a big fat ugly bubble" #debatenight
Trump really has handle on who the "very, very good people" and who the "very, very bad people" are. 👼🏼👹  #DebateNight
I'm so glad they're sticking to the theme of tonight's debate: mansplaining  #DebateNight
Trump blames the "mainstream media" for reporting on things he says. #debatenight
Sick of ppl accusing @realDonaldTrump of being racist! He's 4 all races/women #Clinton is on record as being racist 4  YEARS! #debatenight
Trump lying saying Hillary's going 2 over-regulate LIES - she will make life easier for small biz look at her website 4 factcheck #debates
Wow if 1/4 of what Trump says is true we're all gonna die and we live in the worst country on earth and it's all Hillary's fault! #debates
Both of these answers SUCK.Nothing to address murderers in blue getting away #debatenight nothing about conditions that lead to interactions
"We have to knock the hell out of Isis and have to do it fast" -- Trump #debatenight #Debates2016
Okay, someone give Donald Trump an entry level finance class exam and let's see how he does. #debates
Law and order from the man who just says he refuses to pay his taxes? #Debates2016
Did he prepare for this? Because he's working at a middle school level. #debates
Tax returns for wall street speech transcripts, health records, and emails, immunity deals. Hillary has more to hide. #DebateNight
Trump is routinely not finishing his sentences, or speaking in complete sentences. #debatenight
Hope Donald doesn't have hyperactive bladder. Drinking the water down like a thirsty drunk. #debatenight
Oh sweet lord. I feel so bad for Americans that DT made it this far. Hillary had her issues too but really? This is who you have? #Debates
I have a question for both candidates, what are you going to do about the clown sightings? #debates
i need a blunt.   alcohol alone won't be enough to get me through this #debatenight
Falling asleep &amp; watching #Debatenight lol Trump is such a sad clown.
Just a reminder: I've definitely thrown up from sprints right where Trump and Clinton are standing. #debatenight
We have to defend a "cyber" now? This is like the 90s, again #DebateNight
My dad and I have to mute the tv whenever Hillary talks because we can't stand the lies and the sound of her voice. #debatenight
Hillary is prim, proper and composed, laughing on the inside.  Trump is a rabid dog chasing his own tail.  Good game, sir. ✌🏼️  #debatenight
#debatenight quotes at Centre: "He needs to visit the Writing Center because his arguments are not in logical order!" #justcentrethings
Taking responsibility  has proven to be impossible  for Donald #Debates
"Political hacks"  Does this count as self depreciating humor, Mr. Trump?  #debatenight
123... THE CREW IS CALLED BDP AND IF YOU WANNA GO 2 THE TIP TOP STOP THE VIOLENCE IN HIP HOP #TRUMP2016 #DEBATES #debatenight
Pessimism &amp; Denigration of our country are not likely to be popular with average Americans #Debates2016 #debatenight
Ok I really need him to tell us why he filed bankruptcy but want us to trust him with money period..he'll naw #debatenight
Is he accusing the former DNC chair of being a Russian informant or something? #whatishappening #debatenight debatenight
If Trump wins, the "Stop and Frisk" will replace the "Whip and Nae Nae" as a thing I don't understand but can't avoid. #Debates
Professor slam! "I prepared for class..." Work in one Last Crusade quote - "Try reading books instead of burning them..." #debates
I'd like to see Trump live off my salary for a year #debatenight
Trump looks like a 4 year old throwing a tantrum.....Romney KILLED himself looking like a child during the debates and Trumps doing the same
@realDonaldTrump Not paying Federal taxes doesn't make you smart it means you refuse to invest in America. #debatenight
Trump wins it all with the use of the word 'braggadocious' #debatenight
I am playing my own kind of drinking game tonight. Don't drink for months, then have a glass and a half of wine. Woooooo! #Debates2016
Trump hates the press and judges. Why? Both try to hold him accountable. #debatenight
Donald Trump is angry about our ugly airports. Hillary Clinton is worried about poor people. #debates #debatenight #Debates2016
Political debates are usually bad but this shit is fucking terrible. I can't even watch.
Lester shut him down! He had his say moving on!   #Debates
So Hillary's definition of diplomacy is giving America hating Iran $450B and nuclear weapons. #debatenight
my entire snapchat is people putting filters on trump and hillary and honestly i'm LIVING for it. #debatenight
@TODAYshow is it ok to interrupt the other candidate on US debates? Why Trump keeps talking while Hillary talks?
This debate is like Maury, Jerry Springer, and Steve Wilkos show all together! #2016debates #debates2016  #truth #clinton #hillary
#RealDonaldtrump so nervous he is drinking water like a elephant lol   #debates2016
Yikes stop and frisk is killing Donald! Just let him talk!! This Race category is killing him!!  #debatenight
Well. He didn't wear the red power tie like Hilary predicted on #BetweenTwoFerns. Sorry, Zach... #Debates
haha, oh man ... what a disaster for @RealDonaldTrump ... And the weird thing is, Trump Fans will believe he's being amazing. #debatenight
@realDonaldTrump knows exactly what he wants to do as president! Does @HillaryClinton have a plan to change her plan? #debatenight
How is it possible for @realDonaldTrump to say so many words that mean nothing?? #Debates2016
@realDonaldTrump #CrookedHillary is so desperate for the Black &amp; Hispanic vote... HA, LOL. #debatenight
"Charlotte - a city I love, a city where I have investments." #trumppriorities #debates
The guy who wants everyone in NATO to 'pay their fair share' is the one bragging about bucking the federal tax payments. #debates
Thank God for Twitter. It helps to know I'm not suffering alone  #debatenight
To see how empty Donald Trump is, just listen to him rigmarole on the simple question of cyber security strategy! #debatenight #Haba! USA
Hilary, girl, grow some balls and then next time he interrupts, throat punch him, or start speaking up over him #debatenight
Fat shaming too! Is there anyone Trump won't offend before the night is done? #Debates2016
This FICCBOY thinks he right about everything and saying ALL the FACTS are wrong #NeverTrump #debates
This is an hour of my life I won't get back #debatenight #debates
" Loves her future husband, solely for himself, but refuses to sign the agreement on principle. " -Donald C. Trump #DebateNight
Someone needs to get Lester a squirt bottle for when Trump interrupts. It works on cats when they misbehave. #debatenight
This debate is like a Floyd Mayweather fight. Hype more xciting than the event. Zzz #debates #debatenight #Election2016
Again: Donald Trump, declarer of bankruptcy on more than one occasion, has just blamed Hillary Clinton for bad decisions. #debatenight
Is it acceptable to change moderators half an hour in? @andersoncooper where you at?  #debatenight
New debate tactic. If you don't want to hear what the other candidate has to say just talk over them. #debatenight
If Hillary keeps talking about "trickle down", Trump's gonna have some issues in about half an hour. #ThirstyDonald #Debates2016
Shocking to no one that Trump is touting how great he was at something/anything/everything. #Debates2016
Trump's new Econ doom: Can't say things are bad, so it's  "a big, fat bubble."  #HaikuTheDebate #DebateNight
Clinton: Trump doesn't  pay his fair share of taxes. Trump: "that makes me smart."  #HaikuTheDebate #DebateNight
Hill: hate all you want -  Yes I prepped for this debate -  AND PRESIDENCY.  🖐 🎤  #HaikuTheDebate #DebateNight
So far it appears @LesterHoltNBC is losing control of this debate #tightenup Lester #Debates2016
I'm sorry... Are you a 13-year-old talking back to your mother? #wrong #debatenight
"I have a much better temperament than she does." Says the man who hasn't stopped yelling since he took the stage. #rotfl #debates
Ok... And he just tried to smile, wink and confirm with other man in the room while interrupting her. #Debates2016 #debatenight #mansplainer
Sheesh, asking folks to be vigilant gives way to more George Zimmermans. #debatenight
Hillary Clinton in trouble...  If this is her "A" Game @GOPMontgomery #Debates2016 #trunpPence2016
Hey @Trevornoah, thanks arsehole. You have totally ruined me for #Debates2016 hand gestures. Can't. Stop. Seeing. Bad. Things!
Free Halloween costume idea: Show up in a suit and shout WRONG at people all night. #debates
So Trump's answer to race relations is "law &amp; order", alrighty then. #debatenight
Is this really the best we have to offer? If so we are in trouble  #DebateNight
Oh my. I don't drink, but I think I might need something tonight. Mind blown #debatenight
Millions of people in this country &amp; this is the best candidate the Republican Party could come up with? 😭😭😭😭😭 #Debates2016
Clinton supporting no guns for No Fly List is unconstitutional.  So is No Fly List.  #debates
Cyberattack!  Oh this should be good!  Like either of these two know ANYTHING about this...#debates
Chicago actually has the strictest gun laws in the country... so why are the death rates so high??  #debatenight
Ugggg....does she have lipstick on her teeth - we've come too far to be dragged down by cosmetics #debatenight #ImWithHer
Ok. I might need to stop watching before #DonaldTrump stupidity gives me a stroke. #debatenight #stopandfrisk #unconstitutional
The social media team at @Kleenex is missing an amazing opportunity for a viral Trump tweet. #debates #debatenight #sniffles
Hillary is extolling the same neoliberalism bullshit.  Trump is extolling the virtues of fascism. So yea.  #debates
#debatenight@hilaryclinton we love you! You are the best option. Say not to the racist Trump.
Right now @nbc is loving all the promotion of their hit television universe of @lawandorder #debatenight
Apparently we are all watching Saturday Night Live, not a Presidential debate. 'Cause Trump is making me laugh my was off. #debatenight
My phone auto-corrected my mistype of Trump to Grumpy. It's not exactly untrue. #debatenight
I'm gonna use all my aol CDs trying to have sex with Trump. Wish me luck! #Debates2016
Has anyone put money down on n the over/under on how many times Trump/someone tied to Trump has invoked the 5th? So confused #debatenight
Trump is on this kids sh*t. He's blaming every on hilary and saying "I'll do this, If she do that. Wth kind of debate is this. #DebateNight
Trump comes off like someone who gets all his news off of Facebook and YouTube videos and figures he's ready to be President. #debatenight
"It's all sound bytes...I built an unbelievable company" ARE YOU SERIOUS?! #debates
Sure, Trump buildings may have a nice look to them, but the way they get there is the problem. #debatenight
#Trump plan is simple, give #Clinton fact checkers so much work that they have to outsource to China and Mexico 😅 #debatenight
So if you werent happy with his work..ask him to change it or shut up #debatenight
"I just want to get the answer here." Don't we all, Lester. Trump never actually answers a damn thing. #debates
Chicago and Illinois have the strictest gun laws. Murder at all time highs. So where is the correlation versus causation. #Debates
For y'all playing the debate drinking game, what kind of flowers y'all want for your funerals after you die from alcohol poisoning? #debates
He honestly has not said one single thing that was remotely intelligent. #DEBATENIGHT
There goes that #bossy @HillaryClinton coming up with all those pesky facts to keep Americans safe. #debatenight
"The city I love, the city where I have investments" - Trump on Charlotte #debatenight
A presidential candidate just used the word "bragadocious." In a debate. Wut. #debatenight
Why would you count being endorsed by ICE as a win? #debates
#debates Secretary of State powers or soft power saves us $2tril a year. Every war since the 60s has exponentially quadrupled our debt
Wait wait wait, did Trumpelstiltskin really just object to "just words" and "sound bites?" Does he even hear himself? #Debates2016
A better temperament??  OMFG, he did not just say that?? #DebateNight
Why don't Trump's lawyers want him to release his tax returns? #debates
Although to be fair, neither candidate is focusing on cyber hacks &amp; warfare specifically. Beginning to smell a generational gap.  #Debates
Hillary made a lot of sense bout budgeting police for retraining #debatenight
Thank you @HillaryClinton. Race still determines a lot of things especially how you are treated in the criminal justice system. #debatenight
Fat people have suffered on This planet earth. They just took an L from Donald 😟🤕  #Debates2016
lol Holt just called him out and he repeated the same lie.  Hillary better call him out #Debates
Yes @realDenaldTrump your tax returns reveal conflicts of interest and lies you have told the American people. #Debates2016
#LesterHolt . Look. Lemme help ya out. "No. You cannot respond. Let's move on."  Just say that, man. Just say that. #Debates
Like her or hate her, HC has remained poised while you bully her &amp; Lester about the stage. You have HORRIBLE comportment #Debates
This #debatenight is a joke. Why is Trump always going off topic.
#Lester needs to be fired and so does the person who hired him. He's a little bitch giving #trump this time to speak #nonsense #debatenight
Hillary is legit just chilling and watching as he implodes on himself Lmfao #debatenight #debates #Debates2016
#debatenight Wealthy white people have a great track record of fixing race relations...so we're in good hands #yeahright
Stop afng frisk was the problem with the law and community. #Trump #debatenight
Honestly I hate how egotistical Hillary is but she deserves it and Trump is so much worse! #ImWithHer #DumpTrump #debatenight
"I think implicit bias is an issue for  everyone not just the police."THANK YOU HRC for understanding bias &amp; privilege!!!!.  #debatenight
I take advantage of the laws of the nation...next Clinton ad.  What a tool.  #NeverTrump #debates
#debatenight #debates #Debates2016  Hillary was JUST called on her 'taking 30yrs' yet now knows what to do? LOL she's a moron.
@LesterHoltNBC has SO earned his spot. Great job actually pressing for answers at #debatenight. You watching. @MLauer?
If Trump spent half as much time actually answering the question rather than interrupting........ #Debates
You don't get a fucking medal for being commonly decent, ya goddamn nectarine. #debatenight  #weareondrinknumberthree
This election is a lot like having a mostly empty fridge and having to choose between broccoli and a fat mutated carrot #debatenight #carrot
Make sure to send me your questions you want asked in the spin alley after #DebateNight.
Sooo, Trump is now the moral compass on what is/isn't a horrible thing to say? #Debates2016
"There's No Question About That" Donald Trump Answer To Everything 🙄 #debatenight
Does anyone in #NYC actually agree with #Hillary claim of a lower crime rate under #DeBlasio? #Debates #Debate #Debatenight
For @realDonaldTrump to win this, he has to keep on the offense as well. Both of these dingos don't know anything... #debates
I sincerely hope somebody rebutts Donald's current race BS with actual statistics. &amp; attacks the unconstitutional stop-and-frisk. #debates
Donald has a much better temperament than Clinton. On the moon. Which still doesn't answer the question. #Debates2016
Hillary = liar so i dont listen to a word she says...  #DebateNight
Hillary you always plan your debates or speeches .. Just like you said u have been at home pre answering questions #debatenight
Taking a shot for every time trump interrupts Hillary. Wake me up when americas great again. #debatenight
Trump says he has better temperment than Clinton, entire room laughs #debatenight
Let Donald say some shit I don't like rn. I'm poised af to go off. #DebateNight
No-one believes Trump can't release his tax returns when he is under audit, but keep it out of the #debatenight. Steer it back to policy.
Trump at #debatenight : “I’m talking about taking guns away from gangs and people that use them.”
"I have much better temperament than she does"  NO! Wait!!!!!! LET ME TALK AND YELL AT THE MODERATOR" LOL #debatenight
The fact that Hillary is not busting up in pee-in-your-pants laughter at his responses should be reason enough to vote for her #debatenight
i agree we have to focus on terra she was an underused character in teen titans #debatenight
So the question was "why did you think Obama wasn't born here" and trump ends with "cause I want to defeat Isis" we're all dead #debatenight
Herr Drumpf think that racism tensions can be addressed by increasing policing and law&amp;order #bullshit #ImWithHer #Debates
TRUMP: I've done a good job and I'm proud of myself and that's the way I feel.  EVERYONE EVER: No shit.  #debatenight
DT: We learned that Bernie Sanders was taken advantage of by your people. #debatenight
We need new roads, new tunnels, new airports...maybe b/c @realDonaldTrump hasn't paid any taxes as far as we know. #debatenight
Trump... easy to come i under budget when you don't pay your contractors. #Debates2016
Trump takes advantage of the laws of the nation to take advantage of the people of the nation #debatenight
Trump publicly supported Iraq invasion &amp; Clinton voted for it in the Senate. Forget this noise. #Debates2016
This is the most serious she's looked all night because his barely coded racism is so fucking terrifying. #debatenight
I feel like @realDonaldTrump should have his mic cut out every time he word vomits an interruption. #Debates2016
@realDonaldTrump our schools arent leaving and were laying off teachers in the thousands, how r u going to make more teaching jobs #debates
"If I don't get there [White House] one way, I'll get there another." #Debates2016
It is hardly possible to believe but Trump looks more humane. Please stop being a robot @HillaryClinton #debatenight #Debates2016
So....we're just moving on to another topic after Trump bragged about his blatant personal tax evasion? Is IRS still a thing?#Debates2016
@realDonaldTrump on cyber security: We must be better than everyone else when it comes to this. #debatenight .@KTAR923
If #debatenight was a #cdnpoli election, we'd say @realDonaldTrump is auditioning for Opposition. He's against.  @JimVejvoda @kinsellawarren
"Believe me, nobody understands those Deceptions as well as I do. Michael Bay+ Shia endorsed me, I'm the greatest!" @special_j  #debatenight
@realDonaldTrump is clearly the largest driver of political change in modern history #birthcertificate #natoterror #debatenight
Yes, Trump … THOUSANDS of ppl have been killed!!! But have u answered the question tho??? #DebateNight
#debatenight  Oh please Hillary. Go full granny and pull a Kleenex out of your sleeve and give it to Donald
they wont even let the holt do his JOB. just SHH for a second pls #debatenight
That's one way to fix police/community relations, have a police organization support a racist who believes in Stop and Frisk. #debatenight
Trump says he has a better temperament than Clinton?! He's been shouting for five minutes! #debatenight
Trump abruptly leaves the debate because he has to "return some videotapes" #debatenight
BUM! "I prepared for the debate and I did, you know what else I prepared for? To be President" @HillaryClinton best line #debatenight
condescending bitch...you were memorizing lines not preparing to be a president #debatenight
Let's see if they BOTH go beneath the surface on this police violence topic. #Debates2016
Trump says he can't release his tax returns because under audit. Boy, bye. #WeWantTheTaxReturns #DebateNight
Trump! How dare you say we need someone that's going to be responsible for money, your not. #Debates2016
HE FLIES IN A PRIVATE PLANE, HE'S NEVER FLOWN FROM A REGULAR AIRPORT 😂😂😂😂😂 #debatenight
No one says "African American" with a more vile tone than #Trump. Sad. #debatenight
Donald Trump: "I have common sense..." biggest lie Trump said all night #Debates2016 #debatenight
Are we ending private prisons? Can we elaborate more on that? #debatenight
Can we PLEASE FOR SWEET JESUS SAKE STOP TALKING ABOUT YOUR MONEY TRUMP 🙄🙄 #debatenight
Any airport would seem like third world if you flew private. #debatenight
@HillaryClinton's face rn is a painful mirror of every competent woman that has to endure a loud idiot talking over her. #debatenight
"I understand that side, but not very much because we should have never gone to war" nice save buddy #debatenight
"I have a much better temperament than she does" BitucgCHHCGCG YOU FUCKISBDH OH MY G O D #debatenight
Judge a leader by what he/she does not what he/she says. Trump getting in trouble on tax returns. #leadership #Debates2016 #debatenight
This is the worst #presidentialelection in U.S. #history.   Where have all the leader's gone? We can do better. #nhpolitics #Debates2016
Hillary is doing an amazing job remaining calm while letting this lunatic rant crazy "facts" her #Debates2016
It's like watching two children argue over who gets to play with the new toy first. 😂 #debatenight
People are saying Trump crashed on the birther question. Her campaign started the birther movement ! Hello!!! 🙄 ninnies! #debatenight
Trump just corrected @Lesterholt on stop and Frisk,  what an iddiot! #NeverTrump #debatenight
Jill Stein was escorted off the Hofstra campus for trying to "occupy" the debate...time to go back to Lexington #debatenight
I'll fact check this myself: North Korea is a mess no one wants to cleanup. No country wants to go through a Vietnam/Iraq #debatenight
.@realDonaldTrump &amp; racism trifecta linking unconstitutional practices to immigrants to gangs. I can't. I just can't. #racism #Debates2016
Keep reaching Shillary! If you strain yourself, the Secret Service guys can always shove you into the van. #debates #debatenight
I don't give a bucket of crabs about tax returns. Political people apply them because they're running for office. #debatenight
It's not 2020 yet but at this point, Kanye for POTUS please #debatenight
Trump is speaking that truth about how blacks are just being pimped out by democrats. #Debates2016
We're an hour into this debate and I've been thoroughly entertained...haven't learned shit though. #Debates2016
@KellyannePolls No HUGE mistakes by Trump so far. But he made tonight "AAT" (All About Trump) yet again. Lost more voters. #Debatenight
The debate topic is race which apparently means focusing entirely on black people from both candidates. #Debates
You heard it here folks, @realDonaldTrump is here for African Americans &amp; immigrants! *shoos away the #altright for a second* #debatenight
#show us your taxes the freakin audit has nothing to do with it #debates
"i haven't given it much thought"   donald trump just summed up his entire campaign. #debatenight
Here she wants to do away with due process. Thanks, Hillary.  #debatenight
Hey republicans @realDonaldTrump just said "we have to take guns away" oh shit just hit the fan #HofDebate16 #debatenight #Debate2016
Trump is using audit like he wants to get out of a situation with his domination.  #debatenight
Got my first "softball question" with the implicit bias question. WOO I'M GETTING DRUNK TONIGHT!! #debatenight
HEY CALL SEAN HANNITY ABOUT THE WAR I WAS AGAINST IT FOR FUCK'S SAKE - Trump #debatenight
"We need to have more Second Chance programs." Ma'am, we don't even have FIRST CHANCES in some cases. #debatenight
Apparently how chic our airports have become is a really imp part of the #debatenight
I've never heard someone run off so many buzzwords in 15 seconds as Trump just did #debatenight
"Why is your judgment better than Secretary Clinton's?" "Because mine is better!"  #debatenight
"We need to bring back law and order" Yeah. I miss the original serious too. Oh. Not that Law and Order #debatenight
#Trump has more excuses for not releasing his tax returns than he does money #debatenight
The 1st one to say "Check out my hook while my DJ revolves it" gets my vote !  #debates #Debates2016 #debatenight
"He has a long record in engaging in racist behaviour.' Clinton says Trump's birtherism 'annoyed and bothered' Obama. #Debate #Debatenight
*screaming* Trump's digressions and tangents piss me off. Stop avoiding the question. #Debates
Release the tax email return things were all so worried about.. #debatenight
I love this debate &amp; I can't even vote down there! As an avid sports fan with the Jays and MNF on that says something!  #debatenight
WHAT THIRD WORLD COUNTRY HAS HE BEEN TO TO COMPARE AND CONTRAST?? #debates #airports
....so did you just say you want to cut the military budget? Sure sounded that way, @realDonaldTrump #TYTLIve #Debates2016
"The security aspect of cyber is tough. It's hardly doable" How does that word salad taste? #Debates2016 #TYTLive
@TheRealDaphne Look at you ? #debatenight _  Hillary is adept its files, it is quiet clear and composed. Trump as usual, a harlequin.
girl let ME be a moderator. or at least the interruption monitor; blow a big ass air horn anytime someone interrupts the other. #debatenight
so....an article in an unspecified magazine no one can find, &amp; a private conversation = proof he was anti-Iraq war? #factcheck #debatenight
#debatenight #HillaryClinton  just because Trump isn't in the headline doesn't mean it didn't happen.#cybersecurity
Of course he knows all the airports in Dubai and China, that's where he shipped off his jobs to. #Debates2016 #debatenight #debate
Hillary sticking the knife in good and proper about Trump's (lack of) business credentials #debatenight
What are the odds in Vegas right now that Trump cancels the next two debates. #debates
Good job Donald. Continue to distance yourself from Americans. You got all the coins huh. Y'all po folk still want him tho? #debatenight
"We have got to address the systemic racism in our criminal justice system." #debatenight
hilary cannot pin all of our debt issues on trump, that's not how this works. if it was we'd go after tons of wealthy. #Debates2016 #debates

WHO can hire someone 2 do a job, let them DO the job then say I dont like how u did it so Im not paying u? 👉 @realDonaldTrump #debates
Doesn't NBC have the rights to play that sound every time Trump says "Law and Order"?   #DebateNight #Debates
Donald Trump arguing with Hannity.  That's a Mensa meeting.  #Debates #DebateNight
I'm going to remember that #. $694 million. He said he will release his returns soon. LIAR! #debatenight
If @realDonaldTrump gets audited all the time it's because he's always running shady scams like Trump U #debatenight
#Debates2016 - HRC certainly does not obey the law &amp; order (emails)!!
Holt does get some props for his go-to line of the night: “I’ll let you finish, but I did want an answer, so, ANSWER ME BITCH.” #debatenight
Recap. Trump stronger on trade (Hillary had to pivot in the Dem race). Hillary stronger on crime/social justice/race. #debatenight #debates
#debatenight  book selling, name dropping, what about some innovative suggestions? Blame game, too
Take away from our group- Clinton had a good makeup artist tonight #debatenight
Using 5 minutes to sound like a total liar and use Sean Hannity as a arbiter seems like good judgment and temperament #debatenight
#Trump has NO CLUE ABOUT . . . . _____ Oh hell, just fill in the blank.  #debatenight #debates #Debates2016
When trump says "you're wrong" to a commentator. YOU ARE RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT. #Debates2016
This debate is insane ... Trump was cordial at first and then he started charging like a drunken bull. #debatenight
Trump basically said "I'm great b/c I got the negro to show his papers" #debatenight
Yeah blame illegal immigrants to respond questions you don't know how to answer. TrumpCard  #trump #debates #trumpcard
If I was the moderator I'd want the ability to mute a mic! Bicker much?!? #debatenight
He got a TEN year old son?! Wtf.... he's like 70! whew!  #debatenight
"I take advantage of the laws of the Nation", but put me in charge of the laws of the nation. Really?  #debatenight
STOP AND FRISK ARE YOU KIDDING ME? My solution to systemic racism in the police force is racial profiling by the police. #debatenight
@MarketUrbanism Why Clinton doesnt point out that Republicans aren't in favor of infrastructure is so annoying. #debatenight
"OUR AIRPORTS ARE LIKE THIRD WORLD COUNTRIES, I MEAN EVEN DUBAI HAS BETTER AIRPORTS" uhhhhh...? #debatenight
@HillaryClinton does not provide new I for regarding emails. Same old same old. #commanderinthief #debatenight
People who shout "I have a great temperament" do not, I would suggest, have a great temperament. #debatenight
Hillary Clinton "I also came prepared to be President of the United States"  *Mic Drop #debatenight #debates
Of its definitely terrible. He doesn't have the money and he uses charity money for personal gain. #boom #solvedit #debatenight
Vague as all fuck, doesn't know what the hell he's even talking about. Around the point, no real answer. #bullshitmaster #debatenight
Clinton: He's paid zero in tax. Trump: That makes me smart. Come on, you guys, this is killing me. #debatenight
If we need law and order, Donald, then pay your taxes. You can't pick and choose your law and order. #debatenight
@realDonaldTrump has gone from calling her Secretary Clinton, to her, to she, to Hilary. #Debates2016
Maybe he formed a relationship with Boo Boo the Clowns and Uncle Toms, but surely not all of us. #debatenight
He is mad childish!! Please don't let this man be our president. #DebateNight #IGuessImWithHer
Almost 1h later in the debate and Trump is being Trump. But still waiting more from   Hillary#debates2016 time
@Mendoza_Podcast @YonaDagalosi @JohnThomas227 I have the best debates. They're huge they're good and big.
#LesterHolt as a moderator is weaker than Aretha Franklin's ankles in a pair of inch stilettos. #DebateNight
The woman whose primary job the last 20 years has been raking in speaking fees is lecturing a guy who actually created jobs? #debatenight
Yelling down a bass a$$ President in red, only scores points w/ the Brock Turners of the world.   #debatenight
Not paying taxes makes you smart? Lmao that's an F you to the military, the police, and any other public service #debatenight
Wait so does he think the generals are smart or the political hacks 🤔 #debatenight
Hillary: the people watching this debate to decide who they'll vote for aren't bright. You already got the wonks... K.I.S.S. #debatenight
Did Trump just say it's all words, it's all sound bites??? What a hypocrite. #debatenight #PresidentialDebate #sniffles
who &amp; where r these many "generals &amp; admirals  #trump endorsing #Debates2016
I hope after this debate we get a video of all Hillary's eye rolls and forced smiles. Every woman watching has been there! #debates2016
I have yet to hear anything substantial from a particular unnamed person in this debate. #Debates2016 #ImWithHer
Clinton thinks the problem with roads in this country is Trump not paying taxes? #Debates
Clinton is overplaying the middle class dad thing. We know. Humble beginnings. Got you.  #Debates
Trump sounds incoherent. His answer basically seems to be, vote for me.  #Debates
Will he stop to hear other peoples opinion? He loves to hear himself #Debates
#debatenight where's the tax returns? The IRS audit dies not prevent you from releasing your tax return.
Trump, just because you're getting louder doesn't mean your arguments are getting better #debatenight
"It could also be someone sitting on his bed who weighs 400 pounds" Donald Trump #debatenight
Trump is all over the damn place, I can't even follow him. #debates
Donald could just turn everything Hillary's saying around on her -- she's guilty of some of the same things she's accusing him of #Debates
We could have had #BernieSanders BUT we HAVE #JillStein! If you can't stomach this joke of a #debatenight, #VoteGreen2016 #DemExit TODAY!
Can't disagree with Donald that our government has been a shit show for awhile. #debates
Hilary literally said that Race determines where people live and the education that they'll receive ... #Debates
Trump "I built an unbelievable company." Yes. That is the right word. Unbelievable. #debatenight
I never knew 2 minutes took so long until I actually took the time to listen to #DonaldTrump talk #debatenight
Not sure which is best for Trump--too much drugs or not enough!!!   #debatenight
Trump yelling about how he has a better temperament than the calm, cool, and collected Hillary is a moment in feminist history #debatenight
#debatenight got me glued on nightshift. Both candidates have good/bad points. It's a scary thought 'president trump' but imo will happen
I don't have TV so can you guys tell me when Terry Crews explodes through a wall w/Old Spice in hand &amp; declares his candidacy? #Debates2016
OMG he's such a liar..WHO ARE THE IDIOTS THAT VOTED FOR THIS MAN? U mean to tell me that there was NO ONE better Republicans? 🤔😓😵😩 #debates
“The Trump loophole”-great phrase. Clinton sums up his entire tax plan. #ImWithHer #Debates2016
Trump is trying to blather and blather and blather rather than tell the truth. #Debates2016
"You can release your tax returns when you're being audited"  "I will release them. After they're being done audited." #Debates
A judge... a very against police judge #Debates2016   Bake him away toys
If anyone has taken a Logic class or even a single Philosophy course, I'm sure both candidates is driving you nuts #debatenight
Is this unhinged and raving lunatic the person you want with his finger on the button? #debates2016
Does getting guns out of the hands of people who shouldn't have them include the police too, @HillaryClinton? #debatenight
Answer to every question is going to be one of two things: EMAILS..... ISIS #Debates2016
Who is Trump to talk about disrespect when that's all he does? Disrespect people??? 🤔🤔 #debatenight
😂😂😂 RT @ndyGrosso: Trump should get himself to release his Tax Returns.......... #Debates
Moderator- Do you think police are biased?  Hillary- I think we are ALL biased. ~truth bomb dropped~  #debates
An hour and a half into the debate and still no question on Benghazi... Really, @LesterHoltNBC ?? #debatenight
I want Lester to get up on stage and fight Trump for sassing over him. #debatenight
NO!!!!  THE BRITISH came up with the INTERNET!! Sir TIM BERNERS LEE. EPIC FAIL  Typical pompous American republican #debatenight
Donald has snack bars in hotels all over the world, *scoff* I think he knows a thing or two about global security #debatenight
Pretty sure I just heard Trump say he would put his 10 year old son in charge of cyber-warfare. #debatenight
@HillaryClinton Don't forget about all the people who have already graduated but are drowning in their debt &amp; interest rates. #debatenight
OK, tell us how we should have taken the oil? In our checked baggage? #debates
Your honesty is inaccurate Sec. Clinton. Thanks @realDonaldTrump, you complete farce of a human being #debatenight #Debates2016
Trump, it isn't true if you just say it more times.  Sometimes I think you believe yourself... #debatenight
Both candidates mention"#LawAndOrder" and "in the criminal justice system" in the same paragraphs. #IlluminatiConfirmed #debatenight
@saramakeba Even that is to much credit for the things coming out of his mouth. #Debates2016 #debates
Hillary casually pointing out her dad was working class is the most empty, half arsed shit I've heard from her. #debates #debatenight
Yes, let's talk about donations Hillary. She takes money from countries that oppress woman. Unbelievable.  #DebateNight
Politicians, Hollywood etc. Don't live in the real world. They hv security, we don't. When a bomb goes off they won't be there. #DebateNight
Trump has a lot on of nerve to talk about treating someone with disrespect after the way he's treated ppl #DebateNight
Race determines how you are treated in criminal justice system says Hillary #debatenight #MakeAmericaGreatAgain #Hillary2016
America made ISIS by allowing vacuum to form in Iraq. Should of taken Oil, to cut the funds for ISIS #MakeAmericaGreatAgain #debatenight
The audit lie again .@IRSnews PLEASE explain to everyone he CAN release his returns  #Debates
Interesting that we are listening to these two accuse each other of things each have done in all likelihood #debates2016
"No wonder you've been fighting ISIS your entire adult life." First-graders all over the country just instantly feel more mature. #debates
Hope there is a moderator that has more control next time #DebateNight
This is the worst answer yet on the question he most knew was coming #debatenight
Ok. Race is a social construct. It has nothing to do with actual humanity/genetics. #debatenight
Hillary: I prepared for this debate and I also prepared to be president of the United States #debatenight
my question is who is the hell relates to trump at this point? a lizard with an orange spraytan? #debatenight
Coach, can we tag out Holt and put in Chris Matthews? SHUTUP DONALD #DebateNight
Hillary finally bringing up Trumps stance on Nuclear Weapons. One of my biggset concerns honestly. Not anyone can have them. #debatenight
How Donald Trump makes bombastic statements and seems to punctuate the sentences with his hand movements as the words come out #debatenight
Do you think Trump did a good job getting Obama's birth certificate? #debates
How the f*ck do you take all the oil in the ground?! #DebateNight
If NATO, the world's largest military alliance is taking @realDonaldTrump orders through @nytimes, then why run for president? #debatenight
Hilary acting like her and her husband ain't pass laws to unnecessarily lock black people in prisons. Spare me #debatenight
#debatenight HE CAN JUST TALK FOR HOURS...AND SAY NOTHING,, IT'S JUST AUDIBLE POO LEAKING FROM HIS VOCAL CHORDS AND SPEWING OUT HIS MOUTH
What?! It can be someone sitting on their bed that weighs 400lbs? Where does this man get this stuff from! #debatenight
We've must address systemic problems in our justice systems. Reform Policing. Reform Judicial Systems. Reform the Prison System #Debates2016
"That makes me smart." @realDonaldTrump responds to suggestion he hasn't paid any income tax #WePayTaxesSoShouldHe #debatenight
Donald Trump is used to yelling at women in his life. You can tell by the way he's yelling at HRC #Debates2016
Lester Holt it is your responsibility to tame your dog. Or put him out his misery #Debates2016
Im so glad Hillary had a vicodin and a glass of wine before she went in there tonight. She's so calm and Presidential n stuff.  #Debates2016
LESTER CAN YOU PLEASE MAKE THE ORANGE MAN STOP SCREAMING AT THE WOMAN DURING HER TURN TO TALK PLEASE K THANKS BYE #debatenight
AND THERE IT IS THE IMMIGRANTS ARE THE ISSUE WHAT THE FUCK OK  #debatenight
Does Hillary seriously think that Chicago's crime isn't a real problem!? #debates #trump2016
A bunch of people think Trump said he was endorsed by ISIS lmaooo. Nobody tell them. #Debates
I hope Hobgoblin is paying Hannity a lot of money to be his alibi. #Debates2016
Trump whitesplaining to Lester Holt that stop-and-frisk didn't target blacks and Hispanics. #Debates
Hillz had to put on her say sympathetic voice when talking about race 😂 #DebateNight #PresidentialDebate
Well, here we go! The shit show begins! Whose ball of dung is larger, hotter, and ass-tier?! #debatenight
If there is anything Americans young and old should take away from #debatenight it's that their voice truly matters this year #debates2016
this is what you get when you put a racist business man in a political discussion #Debates
"The fact that I'm not being allowed to use nuclear weapons is the single greatest threat to my ego." @realDonaldTrump #debatenight
"There's a political reason why you can't say it" Trump to Hillary #debatenight
Let's talk about why Hillary voted for the war in Iraq. She's ducking her vote #debatenight
Dumb Donald has told Lester twice he's wrong and keeps interrupting him in a disrespectful manner.  Trump can even debate well. #Debates
#debatenight He's  just making this shit up as he goes along!
#Debates2016 #debatenight #debates Lester is biased. I want a different moderator. These ?'s in her favor. She never faced a challenge.
.@HillaryClinton keeps her cool despite no moderation from @NBCNews, @LesterHoltNBC plus the hothead bully - because #SheSlays #debatenight
Man, I really really hate politics. And I don't like to hate anything or anyone. #debatenight
Hackers, used to make money hilary? You mean expose your emails and your lies. #Debates
I mean, Trump like "I get audited all the time!" Like??? #debatenight
Yes yes. Mr Trump call the evil Hillary Clinton out on what she do to #Yemen. #debatenight #Debates2016 #MYGA #MAGA
so many people have lost their lives trying to expose hillary for her self. #debatenight #Trump
I've laughed more at this debate then I ever have at comedy television. #debatenight
how does talking about about obamas birth certificate go to fighting ISIS within seconds .... 🤔 #Debates2016
"HURRY USE THE REST OF THE DIRTY CLINTON FUNDS, WE'RE GONNA BE CORRECTING A LOT OF FUCKING RECORDS TONIGHT" #DebateNight
On at least four separate occasions, I think Donald Trump has been attempting to do his best "blue steel" facial impression. #debatenight
honestly confused when I see people tweeting about anything other than #debatenight
I should have waited til after the debates to give up drinking
Alright, guys. Donald's satisfied with the #birthcertificate. We good here.   #debatenight
Trump's plan? Run the country like the mafia runs the neighborhood. Ask for protection money.   #debatenight
Trump is disrespectful to her because she is a woman  #Debates
Trump: "Or maybe it could be someone laying on their bed weighing 400lbs." WHAT? #debatenight
Uh oh, we've reached the "blame the liberal media" stage, implosion imminent #debatenight
LESTER, I like you from the Today Show but you need to reel these people in and cut them off. #debatenight
Clinton: We need to have more second-chance programs. (Echoing Duterte critics?) #debatenight
lol that guy is so done with trumps bullshit "we need to move on" lololol #debates
Another ad for the Old Post Office Hotel.  Glad you transformed it Donald though it is out of my budget. #DebateNight
Trump: "I'm telling you why I took my business to China! Listen to me!" #Debates2016 #debatenight
Yes, @realDonaldTrump, you are nothing but meaningless words and empty sound bites. On this, we can agree. #debatenight #debates
Why are you dying on this "stop and frisk" hill, @realDonaldTrump? Are you TRYING to lose the debate? I mean...well... #debates #debatenight
If only Clinton called Trump out for his international manufacturing plants as easily as she calls him out for his birther bullshit #debates
#debatenight Drumpf is the one yelling &amp; interrupting.  Hillary is handling him well.
Hillary is doing it. She's making him lose his mind. It's fkin fantastic! #debatenight
I'm going on with this believing he's completely stoned. I'm trying to be biased. It's hard.😂 #debatenight
Nothing better than two rich, old white people talking about race issues. #debatenight
Trump has been under audit as long as Hillary has been fighting ISIS #debatenight
republicans spelled backwards is snacilbuper and that doesn't make any sense like most republicans #debatenight
"The city I love." More like another city you want to bleed dry for your own benefit. #DumpTrump #debatenight #PresidentialDebate
Is SHE SERIOUS???? She called African Americans super predators.  She's so full of shit!!! #NeverHillary #debatenight
@DonaldTrump  you keep saying you agree with her --quit saying that!!! Fight fight fight!  Go get her!! #debates
@realDonaldTrump proposing stop and frisk. It is insane that you have gotten this far. Wow you're pathetic. #debatenight
Wow didn't he just say that he was going to go to war with Mexico?  #debates
LESTER YOU'RE NOT LISTENING.... Lester, LESTER, lesterrrrrrrrr..... we got people and guns, and people shooting the guns #MicDrop #debates
He is winning, because unsurprisingly he has manage to use every damning piece of information to paint her as establishment. #Debates2016
I'm pretty sure Donald Trump just admit that he did not pay tax... #debatenight
Trump has a better temperament than her but he always talks about assaulting protestors and torturing children. Correct, so good. #debates
Hillary looks like a fighter up on the ropes who can't fight back. If she can't fight for herself she can't fight for America #debatenight
I don't like #HRC but I admire the muscle control required to not just be rolling her eyes this whole damn time. #Debates2016
We are so tired of the email give it up now #debatenight
Clinton's response on race relations sound like the same old two step. #Debates2016
The fact that they both seem so untrustworthy bothers me and this debate isn't doing either one of them any favors. #Debates2016
Does dick wolf get a paid everytime Donald trump says "law and order" #debates2016
Most not even sure they like Hillary. They're just really certain they haaaate The Donald...and that's ok#Debates2016
trump needs to honestly stop trying bc everyone knows the truth about him😂😂 #DebateNight
Oh man the guy's straight up plugging his new hotel in the middle of a presidential debate. #debatenight
We know it's terrible, what are you going to do to fix it? Again he doesn't understand the HOW. #Debatenight
I know its only 2 mins but I need Hillary to drill him more on his own words. He didn't just "alienate" Muslims. #DebateNight
"I think implicit bias is a problem for everyone, not just police."—@HillaryClinton. Yes.  #debatenight
"Respect rights of men (to carry guns" -hillary right after she said guns are the problem... which is it hillary?? #DebateNight
Hackers everywhere are crying into their Mountain Dews.  How dare he say they're 400 pounds #debatenight
"I have better judgement than her. I also have a better temperament than her." *audible reactions from the crowd* #Debates2016 #Debates
Do we have a "tremendous" counter up yet? I think we're up to 30 #debatenight
The douche bag has become more like smart grandma, and turd sandwich is more like gold platter of pig shit. #Debates2016
Okay. @realDonaldTrump just had a hallucinogenic moment on stage re: Obama-birther thing. What was that? #debatenight
@realDonaldTrump should bring up Bill Clintons 1994 Crime Bill that jailed many blacks &amp; Hillary supported #debatenight #PresidentialDebate
Umm.. If Donald paints a bleak picture for black families... what does #BlackLivesMatter do? #debatenight #Debates2016
The vacuum created by the lack of a moderator for this debate is AMAZING #LesterHoltzIsDead #Debates
"I prepared to be president. And I think that's a good thing." Preach, Hillary! #debatenight #Debates2016
All this mf talks about is money.. Hasn't answered one question 😂😂 #debates
Can the Donald please turn down the lasciviousness? I swear he looks like he's planning on eating children or something. #Debates2016
A fact check from Lester Holt! Stop and Frisk is unconstitutional. #Debates
Donald Trump is worried about police brutality as it relates to his "investments"... There ya go #DebateNight
Why can't Donald Trump be quiet and let Hillary tell us why Donald Trump is wrong? #debatenight
Not only did he flat out admit that he doesn't pay taxes, he's bragging about it! #debatenight
Hillary now has certified herself as the adult in the room.    #debatenight
Gary Johnson still trying to locate IRAQ on a map.  #debatenight
Trump should have mentioned that Chicago has some of the strictest gun laws in the country. That would have been brilliant. #debatenight
I think I'm going to switch to the other channel showing violence and aggression...ESPN. #debates #MondayNightFootball
Omggggggg yassssssssss trump talks Obama's birth certificate and how it's directly correlated to ISIS and the border. #Debates2016
I wonder if he wears that mop in a man-bun when he's home yelling "WRONG. WRONG. WRONG." to all his servants. #debatenight #worsthairever
"That makes me smart" - the fact that he didn't pay taxes?  Really?? #Debates2016
Let's talk colors:  Hillary's red = power &amp; strength  Donald's blue tie = calm &amp; cool #debatenight
Trump's word vomit in this debate is just his true substance trying to escape his icky orange shell #Debates2016
"We should have taken the oil" because that would have completely stopped ISIS?????? #debatenight
Take a drink or ten! He said @SeanHannity a dozen times in the same run-on sentence. #debatenight
If the man doesn't pay people he has under contract why would I trust him to fight for fair wages for me?  #Debates2016
I keep hoping that the two halves of the screen are going to meet, 'Mad magazine style' to reveal new words. #debatenight
This US presidential election has been such a shit-show but these #debates have so much entertainment value
#debates I am entertained but want to hear more plans less bluster.
"Rant, rant, rant for 80 minutes." "I HAVE A MUCH BETTER TEMPERAMENT!" #Debates2016
When a woman debates it is awful?  @realDonaldTrump you would not know what it's like to respect women
Neoliberals and neocolonialists debate which countries should be allowed freedom and independence. #debates
Alright, let's land this two-winged bird of statism... Are we there yet? #Debates2016
Trump talking about NATO members not paying their fair share, when he says him not paying taxes makes him smart is… a thing #debatenight
Nothing like screaming over the moderator. This is a debate. Wonderful. #debatenight
When Hilary said "Donald criticizing me for preparing for this debate?? U know what else I prepared for? Being President" #debatenight
'You've been fighting isis all your life' trump just lost his temper... debates
#debatenight #Hillary going after the 2nd amendment so she can be a dick-tator...LOL #Trump
Funny .. It's not the poor or even the middle-class ass both multi miljonairs kiss daily and call that a job. #debatenight #ClintonVsTrump
My fave #DonTheCon quotes: "I have much better temperament (than anybody)". "I have a very good brain." "Believe me." #Debates
Thank you, Lord!  He's staying on the #stopandfrisk train.  Bring him down, #HillaryClinton #debatenight #Lowhangingfruit
So, hackers sit in the beds and weigh 400lbs?! Ok, sir! #Debates2016 Somebody has been watching too many Monk reruns. Smh...
Donald is ready to shake down Israel and other countries for protection money. #debates
"Yeah I was sued for racist practices but I never admitted it" #Debates2016
@GregoryHarris I wonder if they tweet or are even watching. How do you still not have an opinion? #debatenight
If he paid $0 in federal taxes, wouldn't the IRS want the money, if it was illegal? #debatenight
Whose watching the #Debates2016  aka #CelebrityRoast? Not me. Tired of @HillaryClinton lies and @realDonaldTrump unprofessionalism
"You didn't hear what I said" I think it's more that we didn't understand it. #debatenight
#DonaldTrump event don't know what he talks. Yeah put more taxes on Internet as well 👎🏻  #debatenight #ClintonVsTrump
Donald Trump found Obama's birth certificate and that will help him defeat ISIS.  America will be great again, I see. #debatenight
I'm not a fan of Donald trump but he's standin his ground against Hillary. She gettin bodied by a greedy nigga 😂😂😂 #debatenight
I'm not sure what Trump is talking about.....banks, airplanes, Duai, we're not as big as Dubai so we're a third world country?? #debatenight
We're only 30 mins into this mess?? I've already heard all of these fights. Why bother? #debatenight
#debatenight @realDonaldTrump what a clown! Reality Show taught him well to wiggle out of anything
@debates #DebateNight is an insult to the 62% of America that want to #LetGaryDebate the real issues. #substance
everyone asking "is lester still there?" who cares?! let'em fight it out, then make up your mind. #debatenight
Mostly just suprised Donald knows a word as long as "braggadocious" #Debates2016
This man basically let slip that he doesn't pay taxes. Wow. What a time to be alive #debatenight
Trump understands Hannity wanting war in Iraq "but we never should have been there" #debatenight
Trump falling apart under questioning over his birther movement. Pathetic little man. #debatenight
Talking about race and gun violence in the debates. Here comes the Twitter frenzy.
So go to the Middle East and wipe out Isis it's that easy yh Trump #Debates2016
Trump has no idea what Hillary's talking about. That in itself is scary.  #debatenight
Never heard about #Trump being racist until he ran for President. I wonder why? Hmmm....#debatenight
Trump... You can't claim something is factual or not... Especially when you're incorrect. #debatenight
"Let's join the debate by saying more crazy things" - Clinton #debatenight
Trump keeps referring to the US as a "war-torn", "third-world" country. #debates
650 million is not a lot? I wish I could say that. #debatenight
Trump returns to stop and frisk and says that it had a big impact toward decreasing crime rate in places like NYC. #debatenight #debates
."Nobody was caring much about it but I was the one who got him to produce the birth certificate. I think I did a good job." Trump #debates
This is sick! Love how @HillaryClinton is making this personal AGAIN.  #debatenight
For someone claiming to not be "braggadocios" he certainly likes to mention all of his investments #DebateNight
They "talk good"? Those politicians?  They probably know how to use grammar, though.  #Debates2016
Did he just say it makes him smart he didn't pay Federal taxes... wtf! If I pay federal taxes this mofo has to pay federal ta#debatenight
Is Sean Hannity really the best evidence for your truth telling? #debatenight
#debates Trump is a liar.  What heck is he talking about now just talking in circle again.
"Your president" I guess he's not Pres. WTF was that about!!? #debatenight
NRA's endorsement of Trump relied heavily on him calling them "good people" on live tv. Cha ching. #debatenight
@peob262 @annewinberry It's really obvious what this debate is missing: A great halftime show #debatenight
The irony of Donald telling Hillary "that's a terrible thing to say." #debatenight
SHOUT OUT TO HILLARY FOR MENTIONING POLICE NEEDING TO BE TRAINED ON HOW TO DEAL WITH PEOPLE W MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES THOUGH. #debatenight
@realDonaldTrump has LITERALLY BEEN SUED for discrimination.. so how can they let him say he doesn't discriminate?? #debatenight
Is it too late for me to throw my hat in for President? #debatenight
"It's all words. Everything is words." Yes Donald, that is how one debates.
Why did the person "sitting on their bed" have to be 400 lbs tho? 😫 #debatenight
"really bad things..more police...lock up the immigrants" is what I'm hearing #DebateNight
Not going to be that guy, but the fact that @GovGaryJohnson isn't at this debate shows you how rigged this system is. #staywoke #debates
If I had a dime for every time Trump said Mexico I would be rich #debatenight
Don't you people wish you would have put @BernieSanders on your ballots now. #debatenight
This is the worst episode of celebrity apprentice. Was @dennisrodman not available? #debatenight
JESUS CHRIST THAT "PENNSYLVANIA AVENUE" QUOTE. THAT'S ALL THIS FUCKING IS TO HIM #debates
I wish Trump would stop saying "African-American" because I'm getting tense. Just be quiet. Be quiet. #debatenight
Not only is that a bad idea but even if you support it you know that is not a solution in any way. 2016, people. #debatenight
Trump takes pride in his racist attack on the first black American. Immediately disqualifying. #debatenight
His words have no substance. We have to vote for what is real and what is good. #ImWithHer #debates
#Debates2016 Hillary sies@r understand when Iran taunts us, they aren't respecting America. Terrorists were given nukes by obama by the way
Yelling!  He's popping quoting Sean Hannity as his backup to vouch for him.  ha ha ha #Debates
@realDonaldTrump team is frantically deleting tweets every time he opens his mouth! hahaha #gasbag #Debates
Uggghhhhh I'm tired of hearin his tired, old, orange, thin haired ass🙄🙄🙄 #Debates
I don't need a drinking game tonight. Hillary's incompetence is reason enough to put a straw in the bottle. #debatenight
Trump only seems to care about / have info on cities he has property in. #Debates2016
"We should have taken the oil" like that wouldn't have also inspired a similar response from the inhabitants of the Middle East? #Debates
@realDonaldTrump YOU created jobs! How many jobs have YOU created @HillaryClinton .. NONE!! #PresidentialDebate  #debatenight  #TrumpPence16
Two words Secretary Clinton does not want to use ... Law And Order #debatenight
Saying "Cyber" means something different to me than it does to you, Donald. #Debates2016
Trump's just sitting there like a kid at school waiting impatiently for his turn to talk #debates #RaiseYourHand
Clinton: We need to rebuild the middle class. Broadbased inclusive growth is what America needs. #debates
THANK YOU LESTER THE IRS SAID HE CAN RELEASE HIS TAXES #Debates2016
this debate is a whole lot of Trump dodging questions and Hillary gassing Trump #debatenight
This man is just making up this answer!! He did not have a prepared response at all #debatenight
Holy crap #debatenight is such a hot mess! @therealdonald_ saying he has a better temperament than@HillaryClinton --GET OUTTA HERE!
Did more than a little porky pie on stop &amp; frisk slip through fact check? #TrumpSoftballs #debates
Im so sick of his "answers" all including "ive been endorsed by..." #debatenight #debate2016 #ImWithHer
Dear America If Donald Trump &amp; Hilary Clinton are the best you can do we need to sit down for an intervention Sincerely #Canada #debatenight
'Sure, blame me for EVERYTHING' - line of the night, @HillaryClinton I love you #debatenight #ImWithHer
Stop and Frisk had tremendous impact. So did concentration camps, Donald. #debatenight
#debatenight if you compare DT's statements and HRC's, you'll notice she has complete, cogent thoughts. His are scatter-brained.
"I have much better judgment than she does" HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA omg that was just straight up hilarious #Debates2016
I love hearing Donald and Hilary yell at each other 😂 #Elections2016 #debatenight
The face Trump makes when he says 'income' is the face he makes when he's cumming #debatenight
foreign leaders watching this, imagining being yelled @ by trump in future mtgs - w/a mediator saying 'wait,no, it's nieto's turn' #debates
"Since we found something you agree on, what other rights would you abridge by means of secret lists?" #debatenight
She thinks she can stop ISIS when she did nothing in the infant stage "I don't think so". #Trump #debatenight
if you're unsatisfied with you're fucking glorious mansions you need to stop complaining #Debates
s/o all of white america voting for trump y'all the realist #debatenight
This debate is not fair. @HillaryClinton is like the teacher, @realDonaldTrump's the student who keeps saying "wrong...wrong.." #DebateNight
Clinton has definitely started sounding  more reasonable and experienced than Trump in the second half of this debate #debates2016
I hear lots &amp; lots of loud and excited words coming from his mouth, yet #Trump is really saying nothing at all. #Debates2016
I would be a better president than these two goofs on tv rn #debatenight
Hillary on race starts out with repairing community-police relations, better police training, criminal justice reform. #debates
I'm ready for one of these candidates to drop a yo mama joke #debatenight
bro do not bring up stop and frisk again. Just fucking don't. #debatenight
I'm going to need someone to fuck my brains out to forget this trainwreck of a debate #DebateNight
I'm going to use "I'm under a routine audit..." with FAFSA next time on my educational application! #debatenight
So many vague, watered down answers... I'm off both of them. Where is Bernie at though? #Debates2016
"we don't want to use the tools we have"- #HillaryClinton  CLEARLY 🙄 #NeverHillary #debatenight  @TomiLahren @kayleighmcenany
"I refuse to watch debates unless my homeboy @GovGaryJohnson is in them."  -@MaxSwafford
@austin_walker Why is the moderator always such a punching bag in these debates.  Wish they could actually tell people to shut up.
#debatenight somebody needs to stop him before he goes up in flames...spontaneous combustion!!!!!
Sooooo trump back to the ORIGINAL question about the home grown terrorist attacks .. What about that question #debatenight
Can we get Israel to open up their country to nuclear inspectors now? #DebateNight #Debate2016
So Donald Trumps plan is not to tell how he will solve problems because the bad guys are listening....Nice logic lol #DebateNight
Did The Donald just imply that IF he paid taxes, it would be squandered? 🤔 #Debates2016
I'm hating the shouting and yelling. This is Trump's idea of leadership.  #debatenight
Does Trump have a cold? Allergies? Or is he just sick of smelling his bullshit like the rest of us? #DebateNight
If I had to talk to trump for 5 mins I'd be literally crying with frustration. He makes my skin crawl #debatenight
"I'll release my tax returns (against my lawyer's wishes) when she releases the 33,000 emails she deleted."   Mic. Drop. #DebateNight
Clinton: Maybe he wants the American people to know he hasn't paid taxes. Wow. Wish we knew #transparency #Debates2016
Every time he says believe me I want to cry. #debatenight #Debates2016 People ACTUALLY BELIEVE HIM.
Forget Pence, Trump wants his 10 year old son on the ballot with him #hesgreatwithcomputers #debatenight
Indeed, money would be spent on people you wouldn't even spit on. Very poor investments, by your standards. He. only. sees. $ #debates2016
Now I understand his supporters. They get dizzy following him as he talks in circles. #debatenight
Germany would like to politely decline Trump's wish to defend us. Thanks, but no thanks. #debatenight
A 400# hacker on a bed  #/b/  You made it to the debates
This is already a joke , might as well drop a metro boomin beat and have them rap battle #DebateNight
When Trump says "It could be China," he's just pulling that straight out of his ass. Again, very presidential. #debatenight
Twitter is majority liberal anyway that's why you see so much support for a criminal running for president #Debates2016 #TrumpPence16
Why is Trump bashing Obama so much?? Like, you're not even running against him?? Chill out #debatenight
So Hillary must then have something she's trying to hide but not releasing her emails. #debates
Hil says race is important, just only in the Northeast though. #debatenight
I could just click random words from predictive text and make a more cohesive argument than Donald trump #debatenight
"A lot of the oil" - @realDonaldTrump How much is a lot? Asking for a friend. Please answer soon. I want to know bigly. #debatenight
HAHAHA they have video and sound bites of Trump supporting  the Iraq war. He's in idiot #debatenight
Im still tripping that mfs actually let Trump get this far....yall some sad poor individuals  #debates
Oh yes, and the lead in to my OTHER favorite topic: Gun control. #Debates2016 #2A
Ever wonder what it'd be like to watch a six year old debate? Are you watching? #debates #fucktrump
"they arent paying their fair share" you mean like you didnt pay that architect for building your building? #debatenight
#Debates @HillaryClinton can't stand on her own.  Needs the moderator to debate @realDonaldTrump.  Who will help her as President?
Donald: I have a better temper than Hillary.                                                    Audience: *laughs*  #debatenight
Uh-oh, we're moving on to race. I hope Trump prepared a fantastic response to this. #debatenight
So guns are the cause of racist policing? Hillary, what?  #debatenight
Not because it's racist to its core? Someone snatch his toupee! #debatenight
Trump just equated all African-Americans with the inner cities. Kinda sounds like another previous candidate. #debatenight
Just ready for Clinton to have a seizure on stage since it might be over 70 degrees in that pantsuit #debatenight
What I've learned from this debate: Trump's favorite hobbies include interrupting people and saying everything is wrong #Debates2016
@HillaryClinton wants to bring ISIS here, tens of thousands of unvetted muslims entering the US ala Angela Merkel #debates
#debatenight libturds, open your eyes, Trump isn't making the US just sound bad, these are facts, you are blind, it's actually this bad.
I DIDNT START IT,  I RELENTLESSLY PURSUED IT AND SENT INVESTIGATORS TO HAWAII TO GET HIM TO RELEASE IT. BUT IT WAS HER. #debatenight
"political hacks" that came out against Trump are people like former CIA and NSA Directors under both Republican &amp; Dem presidencies #debates
ManRepeller: Does anyone else feel like we're watching MTV Celebrity Deathmatch? #debatenight
whatiwore: RT michcoll: Donald wants to take guns away from everyone but white people. He is not hiding this tonight. #debates
whatiwore: Guys. I was lukewarm on Hillary 34 minutes ago. Now Excitedly #ImWithHer #debatenight
whatiwore: Donald keeps saying "cyber" which just makes an entire generation of people feel icky. #debatenight
Trump yahoos will disagree, but he is suffering the most humiliating debate drubbing since Lincoln/Douglas. #Debates2016
Omg T spinning out of control. Hill just cracked her knuckles. #debatenight
For @realDonaldTrump not paying his fair share of taxes "makes me smart". #patriotism #debatenight
OBAMA FOR THE 3X. OBAMA FOR THE 3X. OBAMA FOR THE 3X. OBAMA FOR THE 3X. OBAMA FOR THE 3X. OBAMA FOR THE 3X.   #Debates
"Debate Pork" - the extra bullshit you have to listen to while trying to figure out actual stances on issues. #Debates2016
Why not? 😂😂  I bet the existence of mosquitoes are her fault too #debatenight
I had to rewind that... did he just say he was endorsed by ISIS? I had to have heard that wrong. #debatenight
I swear its like a split screen of the secretary of state on one side with the "Silly Walks" Monty Python sketch on the other #debatenight
Agree with Hillary on a lot of her points on race relations #debatenight
Trump: can we talk about how healthy I am for a second? #debatenight
Hillary should fire her prep team and hire The Daily Show writers. #debatenight
#debatenight  stick to facts Donald &amp; gosh is it any wonder you cannot remember what you said, yeah right who knows
So 3rd world country airports have Ben &amp; Jerry's in them then? #debates
Trump says Clinton has been fighting ISIL for 30 years? Firstly, NO. Secondly, what the hell is that supposed to mean? #DebateNight.
#iPreparedToBePresident is the "FINISH HIM" move if Clinton was a Mortal Kombat character. #Gamification #DebateNight #NeverTrump #ImWithHer
#Debates2016 Hillary makes point that what T said on taxes and what is written in his policy paper don't match, and gives himself big bucks
#Debates2016 T still saying that he isn't releasing his taxes because he is under audit. Lester repeats that auditing doesn't mean that.
@realDonaldTrump Why did it take 5 years for you to believe the birth certificate you supposedly got him to show? #debates
What got us in trouble was Hillary's husband giving everyone a house even if they could not afford it. That is fact. #Debates2016
Trump is right. If we aren't in a crisis, why are bonds at crisis levels? The Fed is not doing their job #debatenight no recovery.
Everyone's tweeting about the debate and here I am on a train back from night class #debatenight
@AdultCatBus name 3 songs by them poseur ur not a real punk u don't even like avril  #debatenight #debates
I want to be stopped and frisked.  Yeah baby 😀   #debatenight
Donald -" I just want to give a lot of things" he means words #debatenight
We've misjudged it this whole time. It's a winning temperament, guys. The rest of us are just losers.   #Debates2016
People love talking about Chicago &amp; black on black violence like the government didn't create all of that... #debatenight #BLACKLIVESMATTER
first things first, end the #warondrugs and stop imprisonment for non-violent crime #debatenight
650 million is not a lot of money. His dad gave him small loan...$14million is small.  #Debates
There #drumpf goes again, accusing judges of bias when he doesn't like the outcome. #Idiocracy #Debates2016
It's VERY common for businesses to file for bankruptcy. I question if Clinton knows how business works. #debates
#donaldtrump how dare you tell @LesterHoltNBC that he's wrong!?!! Bitch you got nerve! #Debates2016
I feel like I need to start praying for this countries well being #debatenight
Which number is it? 1000, 3000 or 4000 shooting in Chicago since Jan 1 2016 #trumpnumbers #debatenight
Let's play a new drinking game. 1 shot for every time @realDonaldTrump brings up one of his hotels, countryclubs or properties. #debatenight
To be honest the candidates are both talking around the issues. #debates
I dunno.  She is way better than him, but he is better than I expected.  #debates
#debates Trump goes after  DNC corruption and makes me dizzy cause I just agreed w the guy who likes stop and frisk.
"I've been under audit for the last 15 years" MAYBE THERE IS A REASON FOR THAT?! #Debates2016
I can't help but feel that @BernieSanders would crush Trump right now. I'm trying to be optimistic but Hillary isn't helping. #debatenight
What is Trump hiding??? He's got a cold!! Is it pneumonia? Will he keel over??? #debates #trumpshealth
Can't believe I'm watching  Trump in the #PresidentialDebate! What is this country coming too? #ImWithHer #Debates
Donald Trump refuses to answer Lester Holt's questions about his birtherism #debatenight
We shouldn't have gone into Iraq, but we should have kept people there - Donald Trump right now #debatenight
"I think implicit bias is a problem for everybody, not just police." @HillaryClinton #debatenight
The fact that the whole nation is finding the debates more entertaining than enthralling speaks volumes about Americans rapid decline...sad
"A man that can be provoked by a tweet should not have his hands anywhere near the nuclear codes." DRAG HIM #debatenight
100s of 1000s of little girls are watching you rn @HillaryClinton, keep killing it #ImWithHer #debatenight
I call for release of Trumps tax returns, birth certificate, HS diploma, literacy test scores, IQ scores &amp; mental health eval #Debates2016
"That makes me smart" he's breaking the law but Trump supporters don't care about facts, huh? #debatenight
If Trump's birther answer goes on much longer, Bertrand Russell will rise from the dead and to smite DT 4 crimes agnst logic #Debates2016
#debatenight #Debates2016 #debates @HillaryClinton @HFA "I will deal with implicit bias." Like the pedophile you defended?
Trump finally hones in on the important issue of this election #makeourairportsgreatagain  #DebateNight #Debates2016

A large number of refugees aren't interested in helping. They don't want to assimilate into Western society or at least adapt. #DebateNight
Donald Trump lied about not supporting the war in Iraq citing the conversation with Hannity. #debatenight
"Smart," says @realDonaldTrump, for not paying taxes and stiffing vets and schools, etc. #Debates2016 #debatenight
Do we really need a fact checker to tell us #Trump is lying? How about just using common sense? #debatenight
Guns are the leading cause of death? So... they go off on their own and kill people. Oh ok I get it.  #debatenight
Come on Lester, get them on track to answering the questions.  #debatenight
I have this gross feeling stuck in my spine after watching Donald speak about race relations in the US #cringe #debates #stopandfrisk
HRC just called for the "big boys" to come out and play and trump unzipped himself and 3 babies came out #debatenight #Debates2016
it looks like it's six or five trillion, fact check that #TrumpVsClinton #debatenight
The very against police judges of America are causing the racial divide.  #debatenight
"The record shows you were for the war" "No it doesnt" HAHAHHAHA #debatenight
"When it comes to policing...we would deal with implicit bias by retraining our police officers." ~ @HillaryClinton #Debate #DebateNight
Trump's 10 year old son must be the one typing his speeches too. #Debates2016
"she is very cavalier in the way she talks about other countries" "CHINAAAA!" #debatenight
#debates #debatenight Oh you mean on Howard Stern? Who cares? Specifics woman. Specifics.
This #debatenight would a lot better if they did it in snap chat using all those funny filters
Last time I checked rece doesn't determine where you live, it's how much money you make.  #debatenight
I will give this to Hillary, she got a better poker face than me. #debates
Implicit bias. Applies to EVERYONE. Let's not get defensive and take it personal. Let's get on the offensive together to change it. #debates
Trickle down means P#ssing on the poor and tell them it's rain. #Debates
Using my Trump fact checker to see how the hell this is "beneficial" to the middle class #debatenight

Are we about to talk about the Trumo and Putin love story?!? #debatenight
Are we about to talk about the Trump and Putin love story?!? #debatenight
I like to think I am pretty conservative and even I don't believe in trickle down economics #debates
All I hear when trump speaks is: 'it's the end of the world as we know it' #debatenight
Clinton doesn't want to use the words law &amp; order b/c historical record pretty clearly shows they're rooted in systemic racism. #debatenight
"I did an interview with Howard Stern" and then Sean Hannity. Well then. I'm convinced. #debatenight #Debates2016 #debates
@HillaryClinton u have my #Vote2016 this #debatenight is a nightmare watching Donald #bullshit his way! He's trying to #deflect #questions!
"Let me just admonish the audience for being an audience one more time" #debates
@realDonaldTrump Don't break your arm patting yourself in the back! Selfish, arrogant and disgraceful #Debates2016
Can't you just say you were wrong like #HRC did @realDonaldTrump? Gusss not. #birther #Debate2016 #DebateNight
WHAT ARE YOU HIDING TRUMP! YOU NEED TOUPEE FOR HIDING YOUR TAX RETURNS! #debatenight
Trump wants to bring back Law and Order.   Finally I agree. I miss that show. I mean I love SVU but the original 😍😍😍  #debatenight
Trump, you are SO RACIST. The coded racism he's speaking is insane. #debates
The searing red HRC is wearing is burning my rods and cones.    #Debates2016
Crowd was admonished for clapping for Trump, but not for Clinton. #ImplicitBias? #debates
I'm not watching the #Debates but Twitter has me mad at Lester Holt of some reason. #debatenight
It is disappointing as a country that we still have race issues in 2016. #debates
Who knew Trump sniffling should have been on my debate drinking list! #debatenight #debatefail
Hillary's trying so hard to be cool and light hearted, she forgot to take this seriously. #debatenight

@realDonaldTrump's saying we need to take guns away from black and brown people with stop and frisk b/c they're bad people #debatenight @cnn
Wow! Trump can't let her talk! How would he ever negotiate for anything as President?It's a sad joke that he's even in this debate #debates
Why does everything he says sound like he's patting himself on the back vs what he'll actually do to solve shit??? #debatenight
"I made a mistake using a private email" - Clinton on her emails #debatenight
After arriving heavily tranquilized, #DonaldTrump's medicine only lasted about 15 minutes.  #DebateNight
He's going to verbally tell us his tax returns now?  #DebateNight
@YNB I know right? He knows nothing about the world so he can only lean on sterotypes. #demagogue #debatenight
@Lesdoggg @OfficerSwanson He's not listening. He's trying to blow her up using his mind powers, I don't think it's working. #Debates2016
Both reverted to black on black crime when asked about the racial divide. Just like you uncle toms #debatenight
Notice how #HRC speaks in specifics? They should put maps of the ME up &amp; have the candidates label them. #Drumpf would fail #debatenight
Here we go conspiracy theories! Blame MSM which has given u BILLIONS in free advertising. Winning temperment 😄😄😄😄😄😄😄 #debatenight
Law and order. Law and order. Law and order. Hear that,. #BlackLivesMatter rioters and thugs? #Debatenight
I'm out! Honestly tried to be good American &amp; watch debate but I can't listen to these 2 idiots anymore Embarrassing 4 our country #debates
Trump was asked about his tax returns. Trump simply didn't answer the question or address potential conflicts of interest. #Debates
"I will release my tax returns against my lawyer's wishes." Isn't that some ish #Debates #DebateNight
#debatenight trump is losing it. He's sniffing and snorting. Can he talk about anything but himself? "That's the way I feel" que the music
Saturday Night Live is going to had a field day with this..Especially Trump. This is terrible. #debatenight
I MADE NATO DO THINGS BLAH BLAH BLAH yes i'm tipsy #debates
Hey Hillary, we already have common sense gun laws on the books. Why not enforce them? #debatenight
there's no substance to anything he says. it's a mess of buzzwords and declarations of his own irrelevant business achievements #debatenight
A proverb: "After three years at a village schoolhouse, even a dog can recite a poem" #Debates2016
Remember: there's still a lot wrong in America. But in this election, there's only one way to fix it #Debates #AmericaisGreat #ImWithHer
Can good humans actually make it up on this stage, ever? I think no, because our system doesn't allow it #debates
#debatenight I have a MUCH better #temperment Trump said interrupting Lester. I mean he's yelling &amp; spitting &amp; losing his shit, but yah...
On a scale of one to even ... I just can't right now  #debatenight
Based on tweets I am seeing, many people are watching the #debates just for the comedic effect. #wheresgary #WhereIsGary #letgarydebate
Democrats are now sure Trump is racist. Republicans are now sure Clinton wants to take their guns.#debatenight
"Under Obama, we've lost control of things we used to have control of."  -Trump #debatenight
"I've been under audit for almost 15 years. I get audited almost every year. It's a way of life. Vote for me!" #debatenight
Someone woke up Lester Holt. Who, BTW, is a registered Republican #debates
Seriously? @HillaryClinton you know the birther stuff was all started by your campaign. #debatenight
IS HE SERIOUS RIGHT NOW IS HE SERIOUSLY ARGUING THAT STOP AND FRISK SHOULD BE BROUGHT BACK DID HE JUST TELL LESTER HE WAS WRONG#debates
I can't wait for this election cycle to end and to once again only hear about Donald Trump in reference to reality tv #debates
When did all the black people in America move to the inner city? #Debates2016
Does Trump have a good relationship with the black community?  The guy who wouldn't rent to black people in the 80's? #Debates2016
@realDonaldTrump "I have a much better temperament than her" 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 I think I just died a little.. #debatenight #debates
Trump literally just admitted that he refused to pay people for projects because he didn't feel like it. Kind of like his taxes #debatenight
.@David_Leavitt it's like he doesn't know what comparative advantage is- and that you can't just slap tarrifs w/o consequences #debates2016
Yeah Hillary isn’t perfect. But she seems like a fucking saint in comparison  #debate #debatenight
I happen to think_______ is the new writing prompt on state standardized tests.... #debatenight
"Someone sitting on their bed who weighs 400 lbs"...and this is a presidential debate #debatenight
Barack Obama went high. I mean he did used to smoke pot, soooo. #debatenight

The best thing Hillary's done? Say nothing. Let Trump shoot himself in the foot. She was so ready for tonight. #debatenight
"I also have a better temperament than she does" everyone finishes their drink #debatenight
WTF does a person lying ing bed "that weighs 400 lbs" have to do with anything? #debates
Can't wait for Lester Holt to show up to moderate this debate.   WAIT HE'S BEEN THERE THIS WHOLE TIME?!  #debatenight
@realDonaldTrump in case you didn't know, debates require WORDS; an asset you own in great quantity but in little quality. #DebateNight
Why do you have to say things like "call him" "nobody wants to call him" "if you read the article you would see" typical liar #debatenight
"We are in a big fat ugly bubble." #DonaldTrump is a big fat ugly bubble. #debatenight
Are his kids proud of of all these lies he tells ? #debatenight #ImWithHer
Why are debates on this late...? Working America is about to go to bed.
If trumps ego wasn't in the way he could be dominating the debate #debatenight
OK. I'll give him this one, "braggadocios" is a good word to pull out of his ass like that. #Debates2016
"Typical politician" he says as he continues running for one of the highest and most powerful political offices in the world #debatenight
#debatenight #Debates2016 #HillaryClinton is taking credit for John Kerry's work on the #IranDeal-I doubt he'll appreciate that~!
Trump feels Clinton has not released enough information -- she has released 3 decades of tax returns, he has released 0. #Debates2016
If Trump was doing a research paper in school, his works cited page would just say "a report I just saw".  #debatenight
Dad just yelled the same thing at the TV that I did so there's that #Debates2016
Does Trump not understand the issue w "Stop and Frisk"? Idiotic racist!  #debatenight
Even the Hofstra audience, under fear of reprimand from Lester, couldn't contain themselves when Trump touted his temperament!  #debatenight
Holt: Wanna apologize for saying the pres must be African? Trump: Umm nope. I did he country a favor.  HRC: um, I can't w him. #debates2016
@smerconish Trump's losing his breath. 15 minutes in. Not good for him #debatenight

It's not all words. They're substantial claims about your way of doing business #debates
Trump's running a company Not a COUNTRY! I'm sick of this dude. I'm disgusted to even type his name on my Twitter page #debatenight #Debates
This incoherent Oompa Loompa wants to implement an Unconstitutional nationwide stop &amp; frisk program. #debates
Madame Secretary, I say this with all due respect: the gloves gotta come off. We need you. #DebateNight #ImWithHer
When your aunt n uncle see each other after the divorce #debatenight
His pitches are supposedly Economic but he barely talks about actual aspects of the economy like inflation or the wage gap #debatenight
The way Hillary smiles when she has a retort to Donald Trump gives me life #debatenight
#DebateNight @realDonaldTrump what does a birth certificate has to do with jobs and bla bla bla? focus #donaldnofacts
#DebateNight @realDonaldTrump @HillaryClinton so he just said the economy is more important than national security Hummmm! #donaldnofacts
Is it to late to call up @BernieSanders to drag us out of this mess? #debatenight #Debates2016
Finally-- I get to hear more about emails and tax returns. #importantissues #debatenight
Maybe it won't end up this way, but @HillaryClinton is WIPING the floor with him. #ImWithHer #Debates2016
#debatenight "I prepared for this debate, and I prepared to be president" - boom!!
He cannot handle this. No facts. No impulse control. He's being taken down, he knows it, and he's losing it. #Debates2016
HILLARY STOP TALKING ABOUT GUNS THAT WILL LOSE YOU THE ELECTION JFC #debatenight
Donald, this isn't all about your company. This isn't show and tell. #Debates
is all trump going to do is blame Obama &amp; Hillary? is this 3rd grade?  #debatenight
Why are tax returns more important than emails about our national security? #debatenight
I give round one to @realDonaldTrump! @HillaryClinton needs to step her game up! #debatenight
Hillary calls Trump! "You just accused me of preparing for this debate. Yes I did. Also prepared for being POTUS" #Debates
Kind of Like we will have to keep guessing what your emails said Hilary #Debates
Each of these 2 minute segments are the longest 2 minutes of my life. #debates
He says he is a "business man" then why is he trying to be a politician #debatenight
I often think about staying in the states, then presidential candidates use the term "bragadocious" and I'm like baaaaiiiiii. #debatenight
I love seeing the look on the other persons face when the one person is talking #Debates
Trump keeps drinking from his water, but Clinton hasn't. Is Trump well? #debatenight
We need more parties on stage.. Checks and balances instead of these talking piñatas #debatenight
We had a businessman politician who knows about money - his name is Clive Palmer. He fucked over a lot of citizens for profits  #debatenight
The US is getting ripped off by so many countries, it needs a leader who's a pro at ripping people off. - @realDonaldTrump #debatenight
#debatenight SHE is full is soundbytes. HE is talking like a HUMAN
RT rjeskow: If RealDonaldTrump proposed stop &amp; frisk for tax evaders and white collar criminals, he might have a point #debates #debatenigh…
Well if hillary gets the job ..Monica will take care of bill #Debates
If @HillaryClinton, as she claims, is the only one on  stage preparing to be President, then she MUST be pushed to be better. #Debates2016
Trump doesn't want people to talk when it's his turn, but he'll talk during Hilary's turn? Oh that's rich (pun intended). #Debates2016
Hillary want to take guns away from law abiding citizens- criminals will still get guns and citizens will be defenseless  #Debates
This is everything I hoped it would be.  Trump is melting down before our eyes.  There was NO debate prep.  #debate #debatenight
Bruh I deleted 33,000 spam emails THIS WEEK. Stop bringing this tired, rehashed, non-news bullshit up. #debatenight
"You decided to stay home and that's okay."  Ya'all heard it here first- recovering from pneumonia is shameful. #debatenight
I CANT FREAKING STAND HOW MUCH HE TALKS OVER PEOPLE UGHHHH #debatenight
In most other civilized countries at this moment, #debatenight is playing on @ComedyCentral. 🙄
@seanhannity @realDonaldTrump’s credibility hinges on American calling u.  Didn’t think necessary since you have a big stage. #debatenight
654 mill isn't a lot of money.  And the guy has poor people sending him even more money now.  Funny how that works. #debatenight
So ask him about Israel, would he stop that aid?   ASK.  #debatenight
You know when you're in an interview and you know exactly what to say, but your resume says otherwise. This is great acting. #Debates2016
"The community says see ya later" I think you're just not listening? #debatenight
Sarah Palin word salad has been trumped by Donald Trump word salad. #debatenight
Donald Trump loves to talk about paying fair share but still refuses to pay his? #debatenight
This debate annoying already. All I'm hearing a lies being yelled and people getting interrupted. And the crowd. I hear them too. #Debates
Trump: I have a much better temperament than she does. Can we get a fact check on that immediately please?? #debatenight
Trump saying he's going to initiate disarmament. So now he's Gene fucking McCarthy?  #debatenight
Why is this starting to feel like a marriage counseling session? #debates
Serious question: What drugs is Trump taking? What is the deal with the sniffling? #debates

He's so rude, talk in gibberish circles all you want but "THE RECORD SHOWS OTHERWISE!!" #DebateNight
#DebateNight #Trump "taking the oil" w/be a major war crime. Bush made deal w/Iraq to leave too soon. We had no choice. Blame @GOP.
Trump isn't going to win on content but he will win on emotion. In an age of post-truth politics, emotion trumps content. #Debates2016
In a weird turn of events, all of the Hillary haters are making the point that she is actually really GOOD at cyber security #debatenight
#debatenight @HillaryClinton Trump is a businessman not a politician. Business people are raped by regulations
When Trump is losing, he makes personal attacks...I'm still waiting to her a plan #ImWithHer #debatenight
what is the over/under that Trump calls Hillary a "cunt" ?  #Debates
Umm... If you actually read the @nytimes, you wouldn't express such level of ignorance #DebateNight
How do u answer to "You've been fighting Isis ur entire adult life... "? HRC "....well just go to the fact checkers " #Debate #debatenight

"Our airports are like a 3rd world country." So, we should lend taxpayer money to airports, Trump? #debatenight

Oh my fuck is he just saying shit to break twitter now?  Because the crazy is coming out hard. #debatenight #debates
But Donald, I thought not paying your fair share was smart? Which is it? #debatenight
DID DONALD TRUMP ANSWER A QUESTIONS ABOUT RACE IN THE U.S BY ENDORSING THE STOP AND FRISK "PROGRAM" IN NEW YORK?! #debatenight
This is going to be a bloodbath. Trump just sounds like a bully, and he can't stop from blurting out unrelated topics. #debates
My patience for Donald is almost as thin as his sorry excuse for hair #debatenight
Donald started his career being sued for racial discrimination. Obama started his in the living room of a terrorist.  #debatenight
Trump hasn't answered one question with a str8 answer he talks around everything he needs his team to talk for him#debates2016
Making money for his family and companies on the back of middle class workers #debates
@Crackmacs Shots Every time #DonaldTrump makes a #misogynistic #racist comment #Drink #Cheers! We are already loaded 30 min in! #debatenight
Trump is that kid in middle school who just makes stuff up to get the other kids to talk to them. Except they're kids. Not *adults* #Debates
#Debates what I really want to know is Why would someone like trump want run for president? Why now?
We should have "taken" the oil! How dumb we were to forget that! Doh! #Debates2016
Trump won't answer a single question or discuss any actual plans #debatenight
Something tells me settling a discrimination suit in 1970's was easier than paying a parking ticket. #debatenight
Does Lester Holt have money on how infrequently he gets to talk? #Debates2016
DUBAI 👏🏻 AND 👏🏻 QATAR 👏🏻 ARE 👏🏻 NOT 👏🏻 THIRD 👏🏻 WORLD 👏🏻 COUNTRIES 👏🏻 #debatenight
#donaldtrump doesnt like that #NATO countries arent paying their fair share $ but Donald also owes the US back  tax $. Wtf.. #debatenight
Pretty sure "taking the oil" is a violation of international war codes 🤔🤔 #debatenight
Donald, you have bankrupted four companies. You stay in litigation. Tell me what the fuck do you know about money? #debatenight #debates
Donald Trump's true colors are shining so bright that his arrogance and incompetence could be seen from Saturn by now #DebateNight
According to Trump, Black people are gremlins that shouldn't be fed after midnight #DebateNight
Clinton: can't say law and order we have to come forward with a plan. #debatenight
"i know a lot of wealthy people." should we give you a medal or...? #debatenight
"If he doesn't have anything to hide then produce the birth certificate"  ...how about those tax documents? #debatenight
Every time dt says "we need stop n frisk," I hear the black vote dwindle even more #debates #debatenight
Whenever the Donald talks Hilary struggles to not lose her shit and laugh in his face. #DebateNight
Someone get Emperor Trump an inhaler  or some Flonase, he's about to have an asthma attack. #Trumpasthma #ImWithHer #Debates2016
I really hope no one takes my gun away, gonna need a way to end my suffering during these debates #debatenight
Trump should be hitting her with the kitchen sink, but hes just soooo incompetent. We could of had Cruz... #debatenight
No tf you don't, your temperament is like a two year old #debatenight
Game: take a shot every time you're terrified for our country #debatenight
agree should have taken the oil-would have had a voice in the politics of the region -best way to affect change @UGPresDebate #debatenight
What's a more important trait in our president, charisma and fire, or patience, calm, and an even keel? #debatenight
So talking about how black men are afraid to go outside and be shot by police is something he wants to move on from? #debatenight
listening to donald trump is like watching a dog chasing its tail #Debates
Don't go after fat people, Don. That's America right there. That's your base. #DebateNight
Trump: Emails were no mistake. When your staff has to Plead the Fifth, it was no mistake.  #debates
"a very against police judge"  I am a very against Trump human  #debatenight
"It could be someone sitting on their bed that weighs 400 lbs..." --or it could be Martians, or Bugs Bunny, or Cap't Crunch! #debatenight
“@BretBaier: .@HillaryClinton: I would do everything possible to take out #ISIS leadership #debates”. Like you and O did for #Benghazi?
We deserve to know why Donald didn't publicly announce his obvious infectious disease.  Lack of transparency, Donald? #debatenight #sniffles
He is so defensive. As soon as she mentions him, he is chiming in.  PLEASE tell me this looks nuts to his supporters. #Debates2016
How is it, that these 2 idiots, are our candidates? 😒 #Debates
This MF'n Trump hasn't paid a nickel in Taxes all these years #debatenight
Donald Trump's rhetoric is working towards consolidating the white blue collar vote. Whether it's successful is different #DebateNight
whatiwore: I hope someone makes an auto tuned top10 hit out of realDonaldTrump's ramblings tonight. I mean just for the laughs. #debatenight
YOU NEED TO SAY OUT LOUD THAT STOP AND FRISK IS RACIST!#debatenight
@ma_dejac lester points out you can release your returns during an audit #debates
"fck memorizing annual defense budgets it was five or six idfc but i read a thing ok I CAN READ" #debates
This is my first time engaging twitter for the #debatenight . The #clapback is life!
Why cant the Donald name specifics when replying, always vague answers! Fool should of practiced! #debates
Clinton is very right here - we need good relations with Muslim communities. #debatenight
I hate both of these people now.  I'm no longer undecided.  I'm immigrating to Canada 😬 #debatenight
Does Trump realize we have video footage of him saying these things? #debatenight
#Debates2016 what's with Hillary blinking? Son just counted 115 in 2 minutes!
Two white candidates talking about race - you really see the fear in their eyes right now #SnifflingTrump is SO MUCH QUIETER #debatenight
So very in love with Hillary's happiness at Trump losing his shit already. #factcheck  #DebateNight
He actually handled the taxes/finance question pretty well. Until he went off topic. #debatenight
Saying thats its not true that hispanics and african americans are the ones prominetly frisked 🙄 #debatenight
Think how much more unwatchable this debate would be if it was Trump vs. Bernie. #Debates2016
Hillary and Obama shouldn't have gone into Iraq?  What?  #Debates
If you don't get DALLAS OUT OF YOUR MOUTH!!!!! Trump! One man shooting 5 cops means Dallas is in trouble??? #Debates
If only Clinton and Trump actually stood close together, then the backdrop would make sense. #debatenight
"I'll release my tax forms until she releases them."  He said the same shit when he was debating with Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio  #debatenight
Wait for it...after incessantly claiming Clinton needs to smile more, Fox "News" to say she was smiling too much looking smug #Debates2016
I want someone to talk about me the way Trump talks about China #debatenight
Yeah Chicago's gun laws have done an awesome job preventing gun violence @HillaryClinton #2A #Debates
Trump just yelled FACTS!!! Someone please photoshop  some Timberlands on Donald. #debatenight
Was holding out small hope that this debate would produce some actual vision and plans for our future. WTH was I thinking? #debates
What is this "your" president? Did I miss something that happened in America? Do we have more than one president? #DebateNight
I am going to have to drink a bottle of wine to get through this night. J.F.C. #heartattackcity #factcheck #ImWithHer #slay #debatenight
@cnnbrk ....Oh! He's saying 'big league' so that makes no more sense than when I didn't understand him. #debatenight #Trump
Hey @Kleenex, y'all are missing a huge marketing opportunity by not @ ing Trump and offering him a free box for that sniffle. #debatenight
"It's a good line though. It tests very well in the many focus groups it was tested in before I said it tonight." -Hillary #debatenight
Ok but now imagine if Hillary was arguing with a real politician. Imagine that level of discourse. #debatenight
Trump to put his son (his 10 year old son) in charge of cyber security #Debates
Ok Mr. Trump law and order... but how? What's your plan? #Debates
mom: why'd you fail the test?  trump: but everyone else failed it too!!!! the teacher was failing everyone   #Debates2016
Hillary: Maybe He never paid federal taxes Donald Trump: That makes me smart. 😱 how is that okay?! Lmao #debatenight
His strongest attribute is his "temperament" 😂 ACTUALLY ON THE FLOOR IN TEARS. #debatenight
Trump: it's terrible what's going on in Chicago. I have property there. #debatenight
China is not a threat online. If anything the greatest threat online to NA servers are the South Korean LOL teams. #Debates #Worlds
Hilary is just letting Trump destroy himself and i love it #debatenight
She missed a crucial opportunity to call out the bad characters on police forces. We need BOTH sides to be better #debatenight
HC should talk about her plans, don't mind DT when he begins questioning her, wants to stop HC from making a point #Debates
Who said this?   "Believe me 👆!"   #debatenight  #debates  #Debates2016
#Trump #debatenight did he just say blowing an Iranian ship out of the water for taunting us would not start a war? Independents, listen.
Trump essentially just said that the only people who should have guns are rich white people. #stopandfrisk #debatenight
law = judicial and order = police and we actually have both of those in our country. They might be broken but we have them #debates
He criticized her for staying home to prepare for the debate. And she dropped the mic on him. #debates
Hilary says make college debt free. Let me ask this, who's paying the debt if not the students?  Answer, everyone else.  #debatenight
Trump had her on e-mails... then went back to talking about his tax returns. Unforced error. #debatenight
The man who admitted and bragged about not paying taxes knocks NATO countries who don't pay their fair share #Debates2016 #debates
Woe Trump just called Hillary on her Russia bs and started dropping DNC leak bombs. #debatenight
This is like watching a mom trying to keep her cool against her child that's pissed off because she took his xbox away #Debates2016
#LesterHolt needs to stop this so-called #debate and start over again. This is not a debate. #Debates
Trump will release Tax records when audit is over. Has been audited for '15 years'. Should be done anny minute now. #debatenight #debates
I knew using "20 Trillion" as a drinking game phrase was a mistake.  #drinkinggames #debatenight #debates #Debates2016
If Elected Donald Trump would need to deal w/ powerful women daily...and he hes acting like he needs a diaper change #debates #Debatenight
It's like he's telling a classroom of grade school kids a scary story. #badpeople #stopandfriskhistaxes #debatenight
"The record shows I'm right." Hard to pick the biggest lies tonight. #debatenight
It's funny a lot of comments are upset at trump treating Hillary like any other opponent #debatenight
When you are regularly accused of fraud, you should be audited every year. #debatenight
I figured out his plan someone told @realDonaldTrump that adjectives are facts...that's why he argues with them...BRILLIANT!!  #Debates2016
I'll maybe release my tax returns if she definitely releases her emails. WHAT? Has logic taken a hike?  #debatenight
Oy vey....I need a glass of wine....󾦆󾦆󾦆󾦆 — watching Presidential Debates 2016
@realDonaldTrump OH YOU WISH @POTUS WOULD JUST GO PLAY GOLF you white asshole #debates
Yeah but what do you think of Sword Art Online Mr. Trump? #debatenight
Donald Trump says I live in a third world country, and I have to agree. My Whole Foods just ran out of cacao nibs. #Debates2016

#Debates Blacks have been done wrong for the last 8 yrs by the lies of the BLACK President!  Lort, I need a drink!!
"A man who can be provoked by a tweet should not have his hands on nuclear weapons."  ~ Hillary Clinton, #DebateNight
Here's the best part of the night: Trump debates the moderator.
All I have heard from Trump is: I have a lot of money, I opened a club, and Obama isn't American. . #debatenight
My IPad got so mad at watching the #Debates it died... It is now charging as I continue to watch
The relationship between police and their communities in Dallas were not good before 3 police men died; citizens were rioting! #debatenight
Hillary gives memorized speeches. Trump speaks from the heart. And you can tell the difference  #debatenight
Psshh..@realDonaldTrump let me let u in on a secret. Stop&amp;Frisk won't stop the race problem! It will only fuel it!  #debatenight #Hillary
"Maybe it's because you haven't paid any federal income tax for a lot of years." Zing! #Debates2016 #debatenight
It was really cool of @bibbymoynihan to step in as Drunk Uncle for an ailing @realDonaldTrump tonight. #Debates2016 ...
Donald #Trump taxes issue now the topic. HRC's heart flutters with joy. #debatenight
Shoving fight breaks out at first presidential debate: Debates are supposed to be civilized affairs, but that doesn't always apply to...
"I changed my mind because My campaign manager told me it sounded racist." #debatenight
LAX is a third-world airport? It could probably FIT a third-world country #debatenight
If the ‘birther lie’ is ‘so hurtful’ as Hillary says, why did her campaign use it in 2008? This is boring. #Debates2016
Trump is mad cuz he's the stoop kid of all his rich friends. #debatenight
hillary is just making up stories about trump's finances. pure storytelling instead of issues. &amp; how is this a major topic? bias! #debates
Taking the 5th doesn't imply guilt. in fact that is the exact thing that the 5th says. #usconstitution #debatenight
What the fuck.Did Trump seriously just say that he supports the Iraq invasion and did he really say that he'd take their oil?!? #debatenight
PLEASE PEOPLE DO NOT FORGET THAT HE CALLED AMERICA A THIRD WORLD COUNTRY BC OUR AIRPORTS ARE NOT UO TO PAR #debates
"My greatest asset is my temperament." ROFLMAO. Holy crap! Goodnight everybody #Debates2016
When Bill &amp; Hillary introduced NAFTA it was jobs in poor black areas that went first. #DebateNight
Trump understands what it is like for ordinarily people to live in America. #DebateNight
Peopled asked Trump about the birth certificate. Of course he talked about it. He likes answering questions. #DebateNight
"China should go into North Korea and fight for us". I'm just beyond baffled by that logic at this point #Debates
Hillary is a terrible candidate. Should be driving home that this buffoon is not to be taken seriously. He is being normalized.#debatenight
Sorry but not at all worried about the beauty of our airports! Let's talk about Republicans not investing in infrastructure #debatenight
Shout out to trump for finding a way to bring his corporation into every argument #debatenight
No time to absorb any of the points trying to be made right now #debatenight
Yes, Donald, nothing connects with the average American voter quite like talking about what its like to fly into the Dubai airport. #debates
Can Trump stop calling cybersecurity "cyber"? I feel like I've joined an AIM chat room in 1998. #debatenight
@NyQuilDayQuil y'all couldn't supply him with nothing tonight.. His runny nose is killing me #Debates2016
Hillary looks like she's watching her spoiled little brother try to explain all that she's stolen from him in the world. #Debates2016
What an utter child. Your average ape scratching its balls in the zoo can form a more coherent, SENSIBLE argument than Trump. #Debates2016
Trump: we need law and order. Police union supports trump. We have situation that inner city are dangorous   #Debates2016
Trump talking about Birther. Trump saying this care not much about it  #Debates2016
In response to not paying his associates, Donald: "I took advantage of certain laws..." #Debates
FYI. Lester kept asking Donald to address racism and Donald never did. Clinton brought up Trump's anti-Black housing discrimination #Debates
Disgusting bragging about being endorsed by ICE. Can #DonaldTrump possibly do anything more to offend Latinos? #debatenight
It's like watching who can say the least amount of bullshit wins. There both horrible 😂 Hillary's just less horrible. #debatenight
Holy cow! I swear @realDonaldTrump orange tinge wasn't there at the beginning of the debate. This man is a f£&amp;king genius. #Debates2016
You don't learn that much from tax returns? I beg to differ. #Debates2016
@JedediahBila but he's he's hiding something he didn't pay federal taxes do you believe that she admitted it was a mistake #debatenight 🚙🏃
So happy I didn't agree to take a drink every time his sniffs #debatenight #debates
I mean, why doesn't @realDonaldTrump get someone on his camp to delete his old tweets? It's pretty basic. #notfittobepresident #Debates2016
I hope @Lin_Manuel and Kate McKinnon are ok with @HillaryClinton taking over as our national crush. #debatenight
Lmfao the deepest voice just comes in "we need to move on" #debatenight
Trump apparently has no clue on the issue of "cyber".  Appears that his 10 year old is his policy advisor #Debates
She's right, Latinos and African Americans are + prosecute &amp; incarcerate than white. #debatenight
"The security aspect of cyber is very very tough" Wow what insight.  #debatenight
Can Trump make one answer without telling which gun group is sponsoring his campaign? #debatenight #Election2016
Does he have a different president than the rest of America? "Your president..." #debatenight
Is he nodding so much because somewhere deep inside him still lives a minuscule human part of him that actually agrees with her. #debates
I wasn't sure what Lester meant when he said this debate was going to be an "open discussion".Now I understand what he meant 😑🙄😒#Debates2016
I'm a #NeverHillary voter but @realDonaldTrump needs a better speech coach.  Focus on plans for America NOT about your business #debatenight
Possible next president just says his 4 year old son can do amazing things on his computer when debating cyber crime ?  #debatenight
Drinking game; take a shot every time you hear the word "billion" #DebateNight
I just laughed out loud. Did he just say he has a better temperament than Hillary??? OMG @toluogunlesi #debatenight
"I take advantage of the laws of the nation." What an alienating comment from Trump.  #debatenight  #debates
Anyone who takes either of these people at face value needs to seriously evaluate their life choices 🙃 #debatenight #socialmediagettingcrazy
How does stop and frisk stop people when there is open carry #debatenight
is it just me or does Hill just have eyeliner on the middle of her eyelid...? #debatenight #DebateWithFFL
Preach it, sister. Uneven sentencing and racist outcomes. Get rid of private prisons. #debates
Not watching #Debates2016 for my mental health. Surmising from twitter feed: 1) Trump is still racist. 2) His brain is running out his nose.
Once again #trump doesn't answer the question!!! Ugh he's driving me crazy #debatenight
There's a new sheriff in town and his name is Reggie Hammond....er...Donald Trump. #debatenight
She lies and he doesn't pay taxes. Okay. Good luck, America. 😊 #debatenight
Trumps hair looks like the stuff parents put in the bottom of Easter baskets #debatenight
Did he just say not paying taxes makes him smart? And this dude is supposed to be President? #debatenight
@realDonaldTrump  boy you suck go back to killing rocks let hillary win the election #Debates
Wait. Donald Trump has been under audit for over 15 years? Christ. #debates
Hillary quoting Michelle: When they go low, we go high. Me: I think I need to be high while watching this debate. #debatenight
Donald Trump has said that we should have taken the oil as it is the source of income for the ISIS. #Debates2016
"Russia they better capability than we do" WHAT IS HE SAYING #debatenight   "Look at North Korea! We're not doing anything there!"
What will happen to the second amendment if most minorities would request to carry a gun? #Debates
#debatenight Because one of the 5 Leaders of the UN is a Third World Country, Totally
@realDonaldTrump if we need a real-time fact checker for the bullshit you spew THAT'S NOT A GOOD SIGN #Debates2016
#debatenight trumps plays with money and uses his white privilege to his advantage, no black business man could go bankrupt or be audit
Settling a lawsuit with no admission of guilt is NOTHING to brag about Donald. Everyone knows that. #debatenight
He wants NATO members to "pay their fair share"? Do as I say, not as I do. #taxes #debatenight
I would literally vote for a dead armadillo on the side of 1-95 before I would vote for Hillary #debatenight
The clintons export our jobs away your forgetting no) Clinton brou h it the pilots into America who eventually dod 9-11 #Debates
WONDER WHERE RUSSIA GOT THEIR CYBER INFORMATION, HILLARY. Soooo interesting. 🤔 #Debates2016
Truth: I am afraid that the US will become the worst imagined dystopian version of itself if Trump became president #Debates2016
I am #AfricanAmerican and I DON'T LIVE IN HELL !! I live in MD, grew up in suburbs. Stop w/hyperbole &amp; reinforcing stereotypes  #debatenight
I actually just had an out of body experience watching the #debates. None of this is real.
.... "it would be squandered, too"? Did Trump just admit not paying federal income tax? Yikes. #debates
Oh DAMN! @HillaryClinton throws down HARD on the whole further lie thing. Good for her! #debates #WhenTheyGoLowWeGoHigh
How will we fix our #infrastructure if we slash taxes on the wealthy, Trump? #debatenight
Tax fraud is apparently smart. Let me go back in time and explain that to my econ professor and see if I get extra credit. #Debates2016
Our airports are like third world countries? Clearly he's not been to a third world country. #debatenight
"I have a better temperament." While berating the host of the debate. Just beyond classic. #DebunkDonald #Debates2016
Did Trump just mention 'taking away guns'? Wasn't protecting the #SecondAmendment key to his campaign? #debatenight #Debates
"Trump just criticized me for preparing for this debate. Yes I did, U know what else I prepared for?Being president." #DebateNight #debates
So... If we elect Trump we could get nice airports?  #Debates2016
Trump's military endorsements are important; much more than the "political hacks." Points for Trump #debatenight #Debates2016 #debates
Wait, is NAFTA or the Iran Nuclear deal worse? He can't make up his mind #debatenight
This isn't a debate, it's a junior high kid shouting at his teacher #debates
When you realize that it's not actually a presidential race but a reality tv social experiment #debatenight #presidentialdebate
A country without Law &amp; Order isn't a country at all #DunDun #debatenight
Sorry but no we did not come up with the internet. #Debates2016
Trump: my plans are good good plans, they will fix them quickly and goodly #debatenight #Debates2016
Again no scold for laughter @ Hillary's snarkiness yet when they cheerd Trump once? Lashings. #debatenight #PresidentialDebate #Debates2016
"Well I'm really calling for Major Keys. I'd like to announce Major Key alerts" #Debates

@HillaryClinton is wearing red because she lowkey is a republican, we need @DrJillStein  on this debate #occupythedebates #debates
I wonder if any of the property @realDonaldTrump owns in Chicago are his African American? #debates
Hey @realDonaldTrump blow your fucking nose already or wipe your nose on your sleeve #debates
trump: we spent enough money in middle east to save the economy twice over, we didn't leave enough troops over or take the oil #debatenight

Why does trump keep on interrupting Hilary?!?! Like maybe you should've spent your money on classes about manners #debatenight
how many people will die by alcohol because of your pandering drink #debatenight
@realDonaldTrump how can you blame everything on Hillary &amp; Obama when there's a whole senate &amp; House of representatives? #debatenight
How this debate is so crazy. It's almost like a real politician is having to put up with the rantings of a crazy old, racist! #debatenight
RT MSignorile: Wow!  HRC. I prepared for this debate. “I prepared to be president.” #debatenight
How much do I need to donate for Hillary to teach me her side eye? #debatenight
"He has a long record of engaging in racist behavior" @HillaryClinton on @realDonaldTrump #Debates2016
What is Donald Trump's version of global warming if it's different than Hillary Clinton and Obama's global warming?  #debatenight #ImWithHer
#Debates2016 The stock market is not going to crash. What Donald did say is infactual just because you raise rates.
God, this is just awful.  "The nuclear is the greatest threat." #debatenight #Debates2016
We were racist but a lot of companies were racist...it wasn't just us. I gave them money to make it go away -Trump #debatenight

While Trump was traveling he should have been practicing for this debate! He makes no sense!! #debatenight
There have been thousands of shootings in Chicago, yet he does not want to enforce any gun control laws #hypocrite #debatenight
#debatenight One of these people is an adult. A boring adult.  But a competent one. The other is a baboon. @HillaryClinton
Anybody else raising their eyebrow at Clinton wearing red and Trump wearing blue for this debate? #Debates2016
"I have met a lot of people who were stiffed by you and your businesses, Donald" #debatenight An architect in the audience who wasn't paid.
He has said repeatedly he doesn't care if other nations get nukes. His cavalier attitude is deeply troubling. #debatenight
#DonaldTrump and Putin sitting in a tree k i s s i n g. 😘😘😘😘 #debates #Debates2016
Trump is disintegrating.  At this second.  On this night.  #debatenight #ImWithHer
10 minutes of this debate has raised me borderline hypertensive 😰 #debates
soooo according to Trump not paying your federal taxes is "smart"  #debates #hiswordsnotmine
Trump is getting worked up. The nonsense words are falling out of his mouth. Wait for it....#debatenight #debates #ImWithHer
#Debates2016 Trump: Long on hyperbole.  Short on solutions.  Real short.
finally, the moderator returns to remind us what we are talking about!  #debatenight #wherewaslester
My blood is really boiling when he keeps saying the African American #debates
I miss Bernie Sanders. Imagine him on this debate stage right now. #Debates #DebateNight
No, Lester, we're not talking about race or any of the things we're supposed to be talking about. This is mostly nonsense. #debates
@Oprah @HillaryClinton Same wavelength O.  Just listen to what you have heard.  #Debates2016
#Debates2016 I may be 16. But I don't want Trump as my president.
"We gotta get guns out of the hands of people who shouldn't have them" said @HillaryClinton, but this should include police too #debatenight
@HillaryClinton  You were more interested in foisting your puppet @MBuhari in Nigeria who has turned out a disaster.  2/2 #debatenight
Oh yes stop and frisk is always the correct answer, there was nothing wrong with it at all. #debatenight
@realDonaldTrump should pull out of the next debates to staunch the bleeding! #Debates2016 #Election2016
Clinton sez would like to end all private prisons not just federal private prisons.  #debatenight
"What do you say about racial healing?"  Trump. "I say nothing." #debatenight
and just the thought there's gonna be more debates after this one Bye?
#debatenight no political experience against 30 plus years she's beating him like a red-headed stepchild
Wake up, Donald! "Law &amp; order" don't justify biased law enforcement &amp; shooting of non-threatening minorities. #debatenight #blacklivesmatter
#debatenight #HRC is scraping. Claims that #Trump stiffed thousands of workers. He says maybe they did a bad job. "Unbelievable companies"
#debatenight #Trump is for NATO but they must do counterterrorism. ISIS was infant when #HRC was in govt. #Hannity said Trump against Iraq
Has he ever even landed in a third world country? I have, and I'll pick a US airport any day. #debatenight
Hilary said broad based inclusive growth is what we need Trump says rhetoric is typical but doesn't lead to action #Debates2016
Second. So, many of what's wrong in the "The World" is the fault of the US/Europe. So I don't wanna hear it. #debatenight
Trumps young son will be CIO for US if elected. "He's so good with computers." #debatenight
"You're wrong." "No I'm not." "You're wrong.  We're finally hitting that hard-hitting banter I've been waiting for. #debatenight
@realDonaldTrump, how can you have "a real good income," yet don't pay any federal taxes.  #smartorcrookedyoudecide #debatenight
hilary just said, "maybe he's not as rich as he says he is." THE SHADE IS REAL. #Debates2016
"Wow wow, I have to respond..."  Donald. 5to grado "C"  #debatenight
Only one way to solve this whole presidential race thing...hot dog eating contest #debatenight #Solutions
New game: every time Trump says anything about law and order, eat a handful of Skittles. #debates
Stop and frisk was very effective during the Miss Universe pageants. #debates
Ya'll notice Trump completely dodged the question of race as it relates to discrimination toward POC?  It doesn't exist to him #debates2016
What's ISIS? It's the terrorist ring that has grown from nothing to being in 28 countries under Obama. #debatenight
If Hillary has a fact checker page, it's bound to be as honest as she isn't. #debatenight
Apparently tonight at my house it's   #debatenight &gt; #HTGAWM   😞
Well, we kinda need to defend #Japan cause they're actually our biggest ally in the East... Get ur facts straight, #Trump #debatenight
Show us ur tax return if you pay taxes at all#debatenight
YOU CANT JUST SAY SOMETHING IS TRUE THAT DOESN'T MAKE IT SO #debatenight
There is more than one path to prepare for president. Outside the box thinking.#debatenight
Should I stay in bed or get up and go to the toilet? That's the big debate tonight. #debatenight
There should be an insult counter for the debate tonight. I'll take the over. #debatenight #Debates2016
"I was just endorsed by isis" 🕵🏾I know y'all heard that slip #illuminatis #debatenight
@HillaryClinton Will wisdom be just as valuable as facts? This debate drives forward not this but hot tempered attacks #debatenight
I have never missed cable TV less than I do right now. #DebateNight
Sorry #LGA doesn't have gilded shitters, #Trump. My tax money can be better spent elsewhere. #debatenight #Debates2016 #
Hillary's GLARE is about to SMITE Trump every time he insults her. #Debates2016
Why is Trump always mentioning his investments and property... Nobody cares 🙄 #debatenight
That's WHY you settle - so you don't have to admit guilt even though you ARE. #debatenight
Lester Holt is getting run over by the Don in front of 100-million ppl. #debatenight
This debate feels like an all white version of Wild'n Out. #debatenight
@lenadunham this is the most true statement ever! 😂😂 I was thinking the same thing! #debatenight
He just praised airports built by underpaid and exploited workers.  This is insane. #debates
Trump playing to fear and frustration. Getting laughs each time he interrupts. #debatenight
"A 400-pound guy on his couch." Trump: Ignatius J. Reilly is hacking the DNC! #debates #confederacyofdunces
Does Trump not know that you can catch like 20 reruns of Law &amp; Order on TNT every day? #debatenight
Like it sucks they don't make new ones anymore, but it's pretty easy to get your Lenny Briscoe fix #debatenight
Trump getting killed on points. Compubox numbers looking very favorable for Hillary. Trump only wins with a knockout here #debatenight
China's making tons of money off of America. You really think they'll do us a favor by invading Korea for us? #debatenight
If you're doing shots every time Trump says "people", you're dead. #Debates2016
I love our airports and the fact he compared us to 3rd world countries is gross he would last a day in a 3 world country #Debates2016
Bang! I prepared for this debate and for being President. Sound bite of the night. #debatenight
#Debates2016 #nato #DonaldTrump .. friends are friends even they don't pay the bill at times
Favorite Trump Ab libs: "Tremendous" "Bigly (wtf is that?)," "Greatly" and "It's your fault." #Debates2016
WE NEED LAW AND ORDER...TO BRING BACK CHRISTOPHER MELONI - My Alt-Reality Trump #Debates2016
Wait. Trump wants credit for NOT discriminating against blacks &amp; muslims? 🤔 #debatenight
Right now, Trump is reminding me of Lee J. Cobb at the end of 12 Angry Men. #Debates
Did I black out or did Hillary just talk actual policy for a solid, uninterrupted minute or two? #debatenight
.@realDonaldTrump filed "essentially a financial statement of sorts." Sounds just as legit as the rest of his business dealings #debatenight
I really want Clinton to give the alt-right a shout out. Come on! #Debates2016
Does the moron know how to shut up and listen, sounds like a 5 year old throwing tantrums #debatenight @realDonaldTrump @CNN @GOP @FoxNews
@therealdonaldtrump release your tax documents. They have absolutely nothing to do with Hillary system emails. #Debates2016
Tomorrow's headline about the debates, "It's all words, it's all sound bites". At least that statement was true. #Debates2016
He sounds like a mob boss. "I opened a club in Palm Beach, Florida..." #debatenight
Trump's strategy: hey everyone Clinton ruined America   Clinton's strategy: hey everyone here are my ideas    #debatenight
Trump is literally the only one who has interrupted Lester Holt MULTIPLE times. #Debates
Im trying not to throw my personal beliefs into these live tweets. Just focusing on generic stuff #debatenight
I love the look on @HillaryClinton's face: like waiting for a toddler to tire himself out. #debatenight
#debatenight too much picking on personal things diverting time from talking about where we need to go as a country
I don't like both of them.  #Debates God help this country. One is hard to trust and other is a career politician, both w/ bag records. Smh
This debate is HI-larious. Corrupt Warhawk Politician vs Racist Moronic Authoritarian talking about nothing #debatenight
Let's be real. She's killing it. She just admitted a mistake. Well done. #debatenight
My shower head is 6'2" and I'm 6'4". Which ever candidate fixes that is getting my vote. #debatenight
I'm guessing by the end of this we will know every state in which he has property and businesses. #debatenight
yall I don't identify as either republican or democrat. I'm just not stupid enough to vote for Trump. #sorryboutcha #debates
Trump's ISIS plans, "if we don't obliterate ISIS in 30 minutes or less, your next invasion is free" #debatenight
Everyone: "This debate is horrible. Hate Trump. Ugh, Hillary. Grrrr." 👿  Me: "My Patronus is a white mare." 🦄 #debatenight
My 5 superior candidates: 1. The Euro-step 2. LeBron James 3. Obama 4. My left nut 5. Derrick Rose's knees  #debatenight
Apparently 'Bigly' is the bad boss in the play 'How to succeed in business' who cheats in his personal and professional life. #debates
I cant see the whites of his eyes....they look like little raisins tucked into flesh pockets... #debatenight
Trump falling asleep like he's 2 year olds and it's past his bedtime. Oh wait... #debatenight
Trump: "I'm under a routine audit and as soon as it's finished it will be released." #debatenight
Trump literally cannot contain himself, going after computer geeks for no discernible reason?? #debatenight
The reality of who these people really are is far different from who they pretend to be on your TV screen or monitor. #debatenight
My name is Blake and I'm the "Go buy a private island and hide from this debate" candidate. #Debates2016
Trump completely went around his reason for denying President Obama was a US citizen for years after the proof. #debatenight #Debates2016
DJT is a business man. You can not get way from being someone who did cruel things to get ahead in business. #debatenight #debates
#LesterHoltDebatePrep   Lester has done a horrible job. He is so biased it is truly sickening.  #debatenight
Trump is the kind of student in class where the oral presentation is 5 minutes max but goes on for 15 minutes #debatenight
So you're admitting that you haven't paid any federal income tax??. #debatenight
@realDonaldTrump quit being rude!! #debatenight At least she got to vote!! You don't know anything Trump!
Funny they only want to spend 2mins on race issues but 30min on the shit that don't help black ppl #SMDH #debatenight #HillaryVsTrump
"He provided a good middle-class life for us"- HRC   that doesn't sound rehearsed at all... #Debates #debatenight
I grew up in "The Hood," the South Bronx. I was never shot or stabbed. I grew up around good, hardworking people. Donald!  #debatenight
I don't wanna vote for an American who encourage Russians to hack America's #trumpisshit #Debates
Holt: Stop and frisk was ruled unconstitutional in New York. Trump: No, you’re wrong. #debatenight
It's official, the U.S is a third world country. Trump said so people. It's gotta be true. #debates
I stepped out to get a sandwich; has NATO invaded on a mission of mercy yet? #debatenight
Hey, Kim Dotcom has feelings too... Well he can afford them anyway  #DebateNight
She's about to talk about his businesses! Ooooo. Get it girl #debatenight
This is the worst open mic ever. Where's the guy that plays Sublime every Monday? #debatenight
Okay really now I am done with the #debates #debatenight I can't take anymore, Just keep Barack Obama in White House for sanity sake
Who the fuck is Terra and why do we need to worry? #debatenight
The only plan Donald has talked about is something that was ruled ineffective and racially profiling. Cool. #debatenight
Please tell me we have other options for president. These 2 are fruit loops! #DebateNight #Doomed #VoteForPedro
Trump: "companies are closing, new ones can't open bc of regulation." How does that square with broad economic improvement?#debatenight
I've never been more lost. How did we get talking about Isis from talking about prosperity #debatenight
I don't think anyone loves Trump as much as he loves Trump. What a disgrace. #debates #debatenight
He gets great credit for not discriminating?  Well that's a low bar that should be easy to surpass. #Debates2016
Why does anyone need to call @seanhannity, doesn't he have his own show? #Debates2016
I'm in awe of how calm @HillaryClinton manages to stay while dealing with this moron. #winning #debatenight #debates
Did he actually respond? Did he say anything? Were those coherent thoughts? What just happened? #debatenight
wait....did trump just say EF YOU, I'M NOT PAYING!!!  and don't he's proud of it? #debatenight
"NAFTA, ISIS, CHINA, LAW &amp; ORDER, ISIS,MILITARY, NAFTA, ISIS, WRONG,WRONG,WRONG,ISIS,ISIS"  - @realDonaldTrump tonight, in sum. #debatenight
Donald Trump questioned about his lies about Barack Obama's nationality and place of birth #debatenight #debates
Poor sap Trump cannot stop trying to interrupt and is bashed every single time #debatenight #debates
Why is he talking to her like she's an idiot?  #Debates
bring up the art of the deal ghost writer bring up the art of the deal ghost writer bring up the art of the deal ghost writer #Debates
Trump in the same breath will brag about not paying taxes but says we shouldn't support NATO allies who don't pay up #Debates
Trump has no self control, he just cannot wait his turn. #debatenight
#Debates2016 If you are so willing to share all that information, why would you not release what is being asked by your voters?
@realDonaldTrump  blaming @POTUS isn't the answer and Law and Order needs to start with policing the Police. #debatenight
#debatenight criminal justice system is about classism, not racism. You don't have the means, you go to prison. Once it was about profit...
It's like Hilary is driving her drunk friend home and he's just rambling nonsense and she just gotta try not to laugh #debates #Debates2016
The best way to build rapport with black persons is to call 37M people the monolithic "they." #advicefromTrump #debates
Was Donald Trump gonna say he was endorsed by Isis ? 😂 #trump #Hillary #debatenight #debate #politics
"ME ME ME BIRTH CERTIFICATE ME ME MONEY ME" - Trump's entire argument. #DebateNight
@HillaryClinton IS LITERALLY BITING HER LIP TRYING TO LAUGH WHILE HE TALKS ABOUT OBAMA #debatenight
Last time I checked a moderator was supposed to be neutral #debatenight
Who TF is law and ordering the police, with your bitch ass  #Debates2016 #debates
#Trump can't answer anything so he rambles on about himself. I guess he's still looking for daddy's approval. #debates
Trump's argument. Seriously? "Maybe he didn't do a good job"? Good luck America!  #debates
Law &amp; Order is still taping, it doesn't need to be restored???? #SVU #thecriminaljusticesystem #mostheinouscrimes #debatenight
@realDonaldTrump thinks 650MILLION in owed taxes is not a lot of money #taxesowed #DebateNight #Debates2016
She's literally looking at us through the camera and saying "Are you fucking kidding me? This guy?" #debatenight
#Trump: "We defend Germany! They should pay us for that!"  😂😂 What nonsense  #PresidentialDebate #DebateNight #Clinton
Every time Donald says unbelievable drink 1 and I'm proud of that drink 2 #debatenight
@HillaryClinton: #DonaldTrump has proved fairly and squarely that he has no Presidential merits. #Debates2016 #DebateNight
Is Trump really insinuating the reason race is an issue is because black folks don't abide law and order?  #Debates2016
So who is this "they" that agree in the African American community that Trump is referring to? #debatenight
We cannot elect a racist reality TV star as the next President of the United States. #debatenight
The best part of this debate is the flourish on the "R."#handlettering #Debates2016
It's the immigrants fault that the police are shooting people apparently....Trump can always find a way to blame them smh #Debates
I appreciate how level headed and calm Hillary is being while he acts like an animal.  He can't represent me.  Period.  #Debates2016
@realDonaldTrump #Debates "just one of those things, 🎶 🎶 just one of those crazy things"  🎶 🎶
Twitter, I love you!  This is the best #debatenight ever!  These tweets are hilarious!!
Drunk uncle getting more drunk. Spitting now•raising his voice. Everyone leaving living room to avoid awkward mom take down. #Debates2016
What kind of persecution complex does this piece of shit have? Every country in the world is taking advantage of America? #debatenight
So are we gonna talk about how Hillary loves Margaret Sanger? The woman who wanted to sterilize all black females? W/o consent? #debatenight
Clinton: There is obviously something he's hiding--conflicts of interest, who he owes money to. #debatenight
Yes, Donald the fact that NATO nations suffered several terrorist attacks recently had NOTHING to do with it. They heard you. #debatenight
Wait...did @HillaryClinton listen to the question and answer it with policy?! Interesting tactic. Take note @realDonaldTrump #debatenight
@YMimmo @Varneyco @HillaryClinton This is awesome!  I know that America will be great again she #DonaldTrump is President ❤️🇺🇸💙 #debatenight
Trump just don't know what he actually wanna say...totally making a fool of himself  #debatenight
My Sister-in-law asks who do you think is winning?  my answer.... Not the American public for sure.. #debatenight
@chrisrockyoz @HillaryClinton should have figured out *everything* over 30 years...but 15 years? not enough to get audits. #debatenight
Holy hell!! We get it, you're against the war..! MOVE ON!! #DebateNight
If Hillary doesn't go in on him right now about his tax returns....I s2g #debates
It's all words says @realDonaldTrump   And then defends his corporate interests instead of telling us why he'd be a good Prez. #Debates2016
Did he just call this country a third world country?   Is he out of his mind? #debates
Fact Check: The human heart creates enough pressure to squirt blood 30 feet (9 m). #Debates2016
Fact Checking: The sound of E.T. walking was made by someone squishing her hands in jelly. #Debates2016 #factcheck2016
That's what I'm talking about, go #HillaryClinton put trump where he belongs and nailed this #debatenight
Every time Trump attacks Clinton personally, he gives her more time to speak. Does he not realize this? #debatenight
He's cutting @LesterHoltNBC off and not letting him finishing his question! Wow... #debatenight #Debates2016
Add in someone damaging property, and this #debatenight is essentially a Hubcap family reunion.
I haven't given much thought to NATO but let me tell you how my sound bite changed everything. #DonaldTrump #debatenight
If Trump wins president I'm moving to Canada.   Hilary you my girl. ✊🏽   #Debates2016
Hillary trying to shoot Trump down for taking advantage of the system as a business man. That's how the shit system has worked #debatenight
WHAT LANGUAGE IS HE SPEAKING? (ok that was my one tweet allowance for this #debatenight )
Forget debates. Lets have a tag-team hardcore wrestling match  Hillary+kaine vs. Trump+Pence  #PresidentialDebate
The should put this #Debates2016 on that reduced timer from the Mizzou game.
my 13 year old daughter just pulled up a fact checking page on her laptop as she is watching the debate! #debatenight
Listening to .@HillaryClinton talk about cyber security is the biggest joke of the night #debatenight
Under budget ahead of schedule opening up the old post office did everyone get paid? @realDonaldTrump #debatenight
Is he actually bragging about allowing Black people in his club? #Debates2016
Hillary now on the offensive against Trump and history of bankruptcies,failure to pay trades people - brace for counterattack #DebateNight
On a more exciting note, the Falcons lead the Saint at halftime. #MNF beats the  #debates
Donald, if you wanted to put a fact-checker on your webpage, maybe you should have thought of that before you got on stage. #Debates2016
And there it is. Lester HAD to fact-check him, real-time. Expect a whole week of whining from the right about Lester Holt. #Debates2016
#debatenight that last thing she said is true if he can be provoked by so little he's not the one with the temperament to lead a country
Lol remember 3 months ago when all these "Hillary supporters" couldn't stand her? #debatenight
Trump just said "Terra" damn he sounds presidential... Well he sounds like W.  #debatenight
After watching the 2016 Presidential Debate, who are you most likely to vote for? #PresidentialDebate #DebateNight #Debates2016
Well...Donald just said what I just tweeted. Again, I hate his guts, but HRC's duplicity on so many issues cld B her downfall. #debatenight
Eliminate income tax. Eliminate corporate tax. Replace with one federal consumption tax. Check out the #FAIRtax #debates
I'm finding that I'm in agreement with both of them at the moment. #debates
Anyway Hillary's talking again so I'm paying attention again.   After all she the only one that knows what she's talking about. #DebateNight
Bruh, knows nothing about Chicago but claims he knows how to fix it. #Debates
Was Trump about to through his 10 yr old son under the bus right now but caught himself ???!!! #debatenight
How is a Muslim person in the US going to know anymore about terrorism than the next  #DebateNight
So you mad because she's playing dirty like you been doing the whole campaign #debatenight
Worst part of this election is Hillary Clinton or Donald Trump can't beat their opponent #debatenight
Any1 else cringing while watching this debate? @realDonaldTrump @HillaryClinton #debatenight Watching our country elect one of these liars
Stop &amp; Frisk wasn't just unconstitutional b/c it was ineffective, but  b/c it was terrorization of black &amp; brown communities #DebateNight
.@HillaryClinton on racial tension "I think implicit bias is a problem for everyone not just police" #debatenight #VLvoices
Imagine the alcoholic beverage sales being scored by business owners tonight. #debatenight
Who's winning the debate?  No one, America lost on this one.   #debatenight
You wanna know why people wanted to see Obama's birth certificate? Cuz he's black. That's the reason. #debatenight
Writer: It's a show where every US politician gets blown up and a Canadian runs the country. ABC Exec: Greenlight! #DebateNight
Ah yes, one of the Very Against Police judges. Well known throughout the land. #Debates2016
#Debates2016 Remember the climax of The Dead Zone? I think Trump just casted himself.
Do you think Hilary knows she has lipstick on her teeth... #debates
She is definitely on some type of sedative!! Mr. Trump has a cold but he is doing amazingly well!!! #MAGA #debatenight
Trump is right. Police is so afraid to do anything they start more and more to shoot first. Let Trump divide Americans more! #debatenight
Trump just said he was going to blame Clinton for everything bad. This is absurdist politics. #letgarydebate #debatenight #Election2016
@realDonaldTrump as prez=facts won't matter-he won't listen to anyone- is a blame stormer. He rewrites history &amp; truly believes it #debates
HILLARY IS ACCUSING TRUMP OF HIDING SOMETHING..........   LOL!!!!! #2016 #debatenight #Debates2016
That Howard Stern interview 100% shows Trump being for the war in Iraq #debates #debatenight
"My temperament is my strongest asset." You know, I might actually agree with The Donald in this one. #debatenight #LowStandards
"I have a much better temperament than she has..." Says the man who has interrupted both Clinton and Lester Holt by yelling. #debatenight
#Debates2016 Even if you tax the rich doesn't mean that is going to help me or other middle class people.Just release tax returns already.
Seriously though- anyone else saying"bum bum" after they hear #LawAndOrder ? #dickwolf ruined me  #debatenight #deb8graiser
Hillary: he hasn't been paying taxes  Donald: that makes me smart ARE YOU KIDDING ME??HOW ARE YOU EVEN A PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE #debatenight
#debatenight Are you KIDDING ME!!!! you started that whole Birther movement you LYING EFFIN Hag!!!!!
Trump just said "Bragadocious". I know it wasn't part of the drinking game, but I think that is worth a drink. #debates
He's literally just repeating the words law &amp; order and talking about himself ... @HillaryClinton you go girl 👏👏👏 #Debates2016
Yeah yeah yeah yeah bla bla bla you know everybody in the world and That's BULL 💩💩 #debatenight #FuckDonaldTrump Vote For #HILLARYCLINTON  ☑

Exceptional! @TraceeEllisRoss: .@HillaryClinton your poise tonight is presidential. Thank you for being you #ImWithHer #debatenight
Trump keeps bring up his real estate holdings... everyplace they talk about he has a business there. #debatenight
If only Clinton would make this list short and elegant and just say "abolish the police." #Debates2016
Trump is a waste of atomic matter and quantum energy... but he's not wrong about the Iraq war and withdrawal being a disaster. #Debates2016
If you can't fly you should not be able to buy!! #debatenight
Over the last little while... Like a few weeks ago 😂😂😂 #debatenight
What a swipe at nerds "400 pounds sitting on a bed" #debates
I prepared to be president -- and that's a good thing. How does that play? Smart or arrogant? #Debates2016
No wonder he wants to be president. He thinks after you retire you enter an afterlife of eternal golf. #debatenight
No matter how much you don't like Hillary, at least she doesn't emulate 2 yo manners and actually HEARS when Trump talks #DebateNight
Trump should not have to release ANYTHING UNTIL HILLARY FINDS THOSE 30k EMAILS #Debates2016 #debatenight #debates
Trump talking about Hilary having a bad temperemant whilst screaming over Lester #debatenight
Can we just get a box in the corner of the screen with @StephenAtHome's reactions? #debatenight
Trump interrupts Lester: "Typical politician. Never going to work. All talk." #Debates2016 #AAUWDebates
Clinton: Unfortunate he paints dyer picture of Black communities, we should be proud &amp; support (Trump groans) #Debates2016
bad people. you can basically see what words he really wants to use spelled above him. #debates
If we don't learn much from tax returns, Trump should be fine releasing them, right? #Debates2016
What #donald? "Someone that is sitting on your bed that weighs 400 lbs." what was that even about? #Debates2016 #Trump
I wonder how this would go if they could only use facial expressions. #DebateNight
"No, you're wrong." Ummm, sure, just make up your own facts! #stopandfrisk #racialprofiling #debatenight
"Just listen to what you heard." 😂😂 Best KWEEN moment of the night! #debatenight
He's crushing her. He wouldn't have crushed Bernie. This is painful. What is a Trumpmerica going to be like? #ericcartman #debatenight
#Debates Could be 2.5 Billion.  Might be 5 Billion?  Or 4.  Or 3.
#Debates Trump may be right - nuclear weapons could start a #nuclearwinter.  So forget that #globalwarning thing
One candidate says one thing, and records show another. Which am I talking about? Both sadly #Debates2016
Donald this isn't a roasting competition. You're debating for presidential votes, not for how many laughs you can get. #debatenight
Did I hear that right? He has a better temperament? He didn't sniffle. It's totally his tell!#winningtemperament 😂 #Debates
Oh God! Better judgement  and temperment than Hillary! This guy is really crazy! #debatenight
At this rate #Trump might have to visit the bathroom to pee all that water he's drinking at the #Debates2016
#Trump will fix problems, won't let political correctness stop him. #CrookedHillary won't fix problems, needs the thug vote. #debatenight
Geez he's a moron! &amp; this is who y'all want as president?! Holy shit! #debatenight #debates
HillaryClinton: Donald Trump's answer for his five years of pushing the racist birther conspiracy theory?  "I say nothing." #debatenight
hmm "restore" trust between police and black communities...when did we have that? #Debates2016
"You shouldn't have a profit motivation to fill prisons cells with young Americans."-- Hillary Clinton #debatenight
I am #Hispanic. I am NOT living in hell. But I will be if @realDonaldTrump becomes #potus. #Debates2016
no way Donald Trump said "You're wrong" to a person who fact checks for a living. #debatenight
Drinking when Trump says #Mexico #China or #beautiful ....everyone is wasted 30 min into the #debatenight #Debates2016 #drinkinggames

I love how all she can talk about is Trump's taxes, but yet she's the one that got some of our soldiers killed. #debatenight
I wonder if I can add "master fact checker"  to my resume #debatenight
Russia has been expanding, like in size? We haven't been updating. What?! #ImWithHer #Debates
I wonder if @realDonaldTrump just has had a wedgie this whole time #Debates2016
Trump knows how long audits can take. Hence why he uses that excuse every time he's asked about his tax returns. #debatenight
Kudos @HillaryClinton for taking responsibility for a mistake..this dude won't apologize for his bad hair.. #Debates2016
Hey, fuckface, black and brown are more than the inner cities #debatenight

Trump ain't gonna release his tax returns until hell freezes over. #debatenight

Trump is fucking preaching right now, Hilary and the Democratic party snaked out Bernie Sanders #debatenight
@realDonaldTrump is giving straight talk and common sense. @HillaryClinton is giving more double speak and scripted nonsense. #debatenight
Trump's way of talking about any location "Lovely place, I have investments there... Oh I guess care about the people there too"#debatenight
Maybe if he paid federal taxes our roads and airports would get more funding? #debates2016
We will drink pickle juice every time a Presidential candidate mentions #autism or #parity. #PresidentialDebate #Debates2016 #debatenight
Inner cities are like a war torn country.- Trump... no.. He needs to visit Syria. #debatenight

Trump: "You have no plan." Clinton: "I've written a book about it, you can pick it up tomorrow." #debatenight #debate
"We cannot just say 'law and order' we have to come forward with a plan," Clinton says. #debatenight #debates
Trump repeats his call for stop-and-frisk in Chicago to take guns away from criminals. He says it went well in New York. #debatenight
Clinton: "There is no doubt now that Russia has used cyber attacks ... Donald's very praiseworthy of Vladimir Putin" #debatenight #debates
Lester Holt starts to take on tax returns: "Don't the American people deserve to know?" Trump: "I am under a routine audit." #debatenight
Donald Trump: "Is this a war-torn country? What are we doing? ... We need to restore law and order." #debatenight #debates

Clinton: "Cyber security, cyber warfare, will be one of the biggest challenges facing the next president." #debates #debatenight
Hilary low-key looks like Trump is putting her to sleep 😂😂😂 #Debates2016 #debatenight #Debates #Trump #Clinton #MortalKombat
I think it's @andersoncooper 's turn to actually give them some real questions #debatenight
Trump needs to give the big guys tax breaks so he can fund his coke habit #sniffles #debatenight
Trump: "I did not support the war in Iraq. That is a mainstream media thing." #Debates2016 #JOUR3001
"I have a better temperment than Hillary" - Donald Trump while obnoxiously semi yelling toward moderator. #debatenight #Debates2016
Trump defining current fear of white supremacists: "we've lost control of things we used to control" #debatenight
Does he only care about places where he has property or investments? #Debates2016
As women are told to remove the word "just" from their vocabularies, so too should Donald Trump remove the word "very" form his #debates
You can see Clinton is struggling to maintain control at times, doing it. Trump is just losing it.  #debates2016
I'm not sure that Trump has been endorsed by 200 generals and admirals. Can't find it in the news.  #debates2016
I swear if I hear anything about a wall... I will chug my wine #debatenight
Trump: "That's important but let me ask you, I like Mallomars, do you like Mallomars? They're terrific"   #PresidentialDebate  #Debates2016
@peterjukes Haven't we all been sued for racist behaviour? Answer is of course-No! #debatenight
You do learn a lot from tax returns, @realDonaldTrump, says this former reporter who studied a lot of them covering elections. #Debates2016
STOP PRETENDING TO CARE ABOUT BLACK AND BROWN PEOPLE, DONALD. YOU DON'T GIVE A DAMN ABOUT US. #debates
Why is Donald scowling so much? He needs to smile more. #debates
I feel like the presidential candidates being asked "to heal the racial divide" is kind of a loaded question. #debatenight
The people voting for this guy are the same who sell out WWE events. And that's the bottom line.... #Debates2016
If they can turn off the mics at literally every award show, they can surely turn off the mics at the Presidential Debates. #debatenight
Imagine if KG was on the opposite side of the debate mic against trump. #debatenight
Trump's face says 'shut up lady'. Now it's gonna say shut up dude! #debatenight
Yes we own 20 trillion dollars because @realDonaldTrump has not pay his taxes! #DebateNight #DumpTrump #TrumpedUpTrickledDown
Hillary's trying to make Trump look goofy out of control. He needs to pick battles. He need to hit her where it matters Lies. #debatenight
Oh god here's the race debate, Trump's response will be something for sure #debatenight
Trump: I'll release my tax returns as soon as my audit is complete. Will it happen before the election? #Debates2016 #debatenight
Clinton: I've met all kinds of workers who you stiffed. Trump: "Maybe he didn't do a good job." #Debates2016 #debatenight
Trump pays no taxes "makes me smart" ... Makes you corrupt  #debatenight
We all know that Donald Trump got a "small" loan from his father...you know what he didn't get from his father? GOOD MANNERS!!! #debatenight
So why doesn't Lester Holt have a knob to turn down the mics??? #Debates2016
You know what will fix violence in Chicago? The racist policing tactics from New York #debates #debatenight
#Debates2016  "I say nothing."  That is the epitome of the @realDonaldTrump campaign.
This man is such an insane liar. I cannot believe this. #debatenight
I want someone to ask Trump what stop &amp; frisk is 😂😂😂 #debatenight
Why is this idiot talking to Lester Holt, and not Americans? #debatenight
OUR AIRPORTS ARE NOT THIRD WORLD COUNTRY. AS A FREQUENT FLYER I TAKE PERSONAL OFFENSE TO THAT #debatenight
"I prepared to be president. And I think that's a good thing." #debatenight #yaaaaas
If you're watching the debates tonight, try to watch Dee Gordon's at bat today for the Marlins. It game me chills.
Did  H and T just both tweet while they're live arguing about unimportant shit? Now we know they don't even tweet themselves. #debatenight
the rest of the world is watching this with 🍿 ahaha America is imploding, splitting the differential and tipping over #Debates
This is the longest routine IRS audit in the history of the IRS #debatenight
It is not about individuals themselves from a two party system with ill intentions... Stop Trump-style and Hillary-style policies #debates
Politics not business. It's sad trump doesn't know how to differentiate the two #Debates
Trump did not prepare for a debate! He prepared to show off  #Debates
Trump trying to defend why he believed Obama wasn't born in the US 🤔 okay buddy #debatenight
"I've admitted I don't know that much about NATO but I'll talk for a few minutes about what little I do know." #trumplogic #Debates2016
Can we please hire J.J. Abrams to reboot this Election? If he can save two franchises, maybe he can save us. #Debates2016  #Debates
I would pay good money for a semantic analysis of his speech. content=zero  #Debates2016   #debatenight
I am kind of surprised that the #taxreturn issue hasn't been highlighted more...  #debates
Trump on race, "I love black people, I know all the best black people" #debatenight
Quite literally 0 percent of black people are voting for Donald Trump #debatenight
Hillary, dont engage him in the garbage. Donald, it's not your two minutes. Youre an adult they shouldnt have to tell you 3 times. #debates
If you're elected, which 3rd-world countries your Wahhabitch proxies would bomb next @realDonaldTrump @HillaryClinton? #debate #debatenight

Someone end it before he defends anymore nonsense. Damn dude, you just salivate over the bait. Geez. #debatenight
Ok. It's been real y'all, but I'm out. We deserve either one of these two candidates. #Debates2016
For a moment this started to feel like a pissing contest on who can kill brown people better. #FixItJesus #Debates2016
She's already been through months &amp; months questioning by DOJ and Co on the emails, dude. Calm down. #debatenight
what are the odds that trump just says "pass" on the race question? #Debates2016
This debate is like watching two children arguing back and forth #debatenight
How long do audits take?  Do people get yearly audits?  I'm not a tax expert.  #debatenight
I can't even type fast enough to express his stupidity 🙄🙄 #debatenight
WHY TF DID YOU NEED OBAMA'S BIRTH CERTIFICATE IN THE FIRST PLACE?!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! #debatenight
By "law and order" he means he wants white people to have that power and control. #debatenight
Free college? It's not free if someone else is paying for it. #debatenight #Cato2016
Trump wants us to believe that post offices are a good investment. Nobody is that gullible. #debatenight
Damn... Clinton is getting real by recognizing institutional and implicit racial biases. #debatenight
Donald, real talk, you can't win a debate by making snide comments when your opponent is speaking. That's not productive. #debatenight
This is like watching a old couple fighting in divorce Court. I think Judge Judy should be the mediator. #debatenight
How has this buffoon got to that podium. No facts, just scaremongering soundbites. Does he even understand the Q's? #Trump #debatenight
.@HillaryClinton wants @realDonaldTrump to release his taxes returns, Trump wants Clinton to release emails #debatenight
.@realDonaldTrump says he has developed great relationships with the African-American community over the "last little while" #debatenight
#Hillary desperate to keep the minority vote. Deflection is all she has got. Laughable. #Hypocrite #debatenight
Stop and frisk was deemed unconditional...  Trump: "No, shut up." #debatenight
TALK ABOUT THE ISSUES AND HOW YOU ARE GOING TO MAKE OUR COUNTRY BETTER.... ANYONE??????????????????????? #DebateNight
I know he didn't just say that get to white house #Debates
I can hear coaching from @shondarhimes comin thru when Hillary talks about the black community. She put some Oliva Pope stank on it #debates
I can't tell if Trump is being petulant or just did too much blow before hitting the stage #SnifflingDonald #Debates2016
Man, when @HillaryClinton answers a #debatenight question it's almost like she listened &amp; responds with actual, applicable words. Weird!
On subject of race relations, Trump says "law and order" needs to be restored. #debates
I'm back to thinking we're all being punked. He's connecting caring abt blacks with advancing stop &amp; frisk. He can't be this dumb. #debates
I can't make sense of the Donald's plan about securing the cyber, but I do now know how he pictures hackers. #400pounds #debates
Politicians have been lying 2 black communities for a long time..they only care about r votes &amp; they say ill see you in 4years  #debatenight
As if "law &amp; order" isn't a long standing dog whistle for "for f*ck black people" #debatenight
Applause for the email shit? Really? How ignorant are people? How is something that did zero damage as bad as Donald Trump? #Debates2016
Away from the police ? Bitch them the bad people ctfu #DebateNight
@iCabway Most blacks do live in inner cities thanks to Democrats. Keep letting them use you. It's paid off so well. #DebateNight
Lester, profiling is how law enforcement and detective work is done effectively. Ask Quantico profilers. #debates #debatenight #Debates2016
Hillary is a hypocrite. She called Trump supporters irredeemable and deplorable. Sounds bigoted/biased. #debates #debatenight #Debates2016
I just don't understand how well educated people can support the ignorance that is Donald Trump. #debatenight
Hilary has lipstick on her teeth and I can hear her mouth #Debates
Neither of them gave an answer about racism that made me feel like they will help end it. Those weren't even answers.  #debatenight
"Like YOUR president"  So, is Trump saying he's not American cause I'm pretty sure, whether he likes it or not, Obama is Prez. #debatenight
there is way too much word salad coming from the left side of my screen. #debatenight
Apparently according to Trump, Hillary is to blame for fucking EVERYTHING #DebateNight #Debates2016 #ImWithHer
Trump keeps talking over Clinton on purpose - he can't handle answering with any amount of detail about anything #DebateNight #Debates2016
Trump is so fucking lost on the issue of POC's being murdered by police I can't even #DebateNight #Debates2016 #ImWithHer #BlackLivesMatter
.@errollouis Love detail: "Under POTUS (we) lost control of things we used to have control of" Phew-Jr. is "brilliant" #debates2016
Trump hasn't even given a straight answer but he's winning? Dumbest candidate with the dumbest supporters. #debatenight
I hate to say it but if Hillary Clinton become President your country will slowly become a Banana Republic. #Debates2016
#debatenight Did Donald just say ordering the U.S. Navy to open fire on another countries vessel would not start a war?
I'd hate to be the person who had to decide who won here... Talk about a crap-shoot! #debates
What do airports have to do with the everyday lives of 99% of voting america? #debatenight #debates
My twitter feed is running faster than my dates after meeting me #debatenight
All the "she's coming for your guns" talk, and Trump is the only one that has actually suggested it. #Debates2016
Blowing an Iranian ship out of the water won't start a war?! I mean... I'm now Admiral buuut.... #DebateNight
"I have much better temperament than her" quoth man who literally just stamped his feet because people were saying he was wrong #debates
@realDonaldTrump, you are the biggest prick in the world! Yes, I said it! #debatenight
Stop and Frisk and more police are Trump's solutions to the racial divide. (His...final....solution.) #debates #LoveTrumpsHate
@realDonaldTrump at least Trump is wearing the American flag.. Hillary not for Americans...#neverhillary #debatenight
UHOH. The donald brought up the emails. BOOP. Where you at #HRC? #Debates2016
#debates yes stop and frisk will improve community relations you freaking moron
I imagine #LesterHolt is just looking at his iPhone during these answers and counting down the minutes til he can go home. #Debates2016
"I'm a business person. I have done very well." Really? Prove it to us.#debatenight
In Donald's imagination 😁"@toluogunlesi: BREAKING: America is a 3rd world country – Sources  #debatenight"
Glad that Hillary has stopped forcing a smile and just looks tired of Trump's shit like everyone else. #debatenight
Why won't he release his tax returns? Maybe he's not as rich or as charitable as he says he is. -Hillary #debates
He didn't pay any income tax in these years. -Hilary. That makes me smart.-Trump #debates
Trump keeps calling stop&amp;frisk a policy that worked. It isn't true. #debates
Holt: Secretary Clinton, what's your response? Clinton: Whew! Okay. *laughter in crowd* and now for some facts and clear speech... #debates
Hil's face when Trump says he can't release his tax returns until his audit is done. #debatenight 🙌💯🙏
I'm a lover not a hater, but I legitimately hate Donald Trump. If he gets elected I'm jumping his damn wall &amp; heading to Mexico. #debates

"We have the worst revival since the recovery from the Depression..." - Trump   Say what?! 😒 #debatenight
Ummm . . . No offense to Hillary, but she's no spring chicken.  How has she been fighting ISIS her whole adult life? #debatenight
Why watch the debate when Indie Game the Movie is on Netflix? #debatenight
I must say Trump is completely honest tonight, he's all for self #Debates2016
Remember when flying a two-ton metal object through the air was something to be CELEBRATED?! #debatenight
A very simple explanation that is now 2+ minutes in and I haven't heard an explanation. #debates2016
If I don't get there through the Underground Railroad, I will get to Pennsylvania Ave another way . I see you. #debatenight

Trump is better prepared than expected meaning he read the ISIS Wikipedia page #debatenight
"MAYBE HE DIDN'T DO A GOOD JOB" and that's why I cheated him #Trump #debatenight #Debates2016 I'm done here
Listen to his disrespectful he just was to Lester Holt. "You're wrong."  Excuse you? #Debates2016
I did this thing that wasn't racist, therefore I'm not racist. #trumplogic #debatenight
@realDonaldTrump has a very bad habit of not answering the questions and not sharing this plan. #debatenight
Trump: we've become a third world country  What the fuck is this man talking about. Someone please help me understand 😂😂😂😂 #debatenight
I've got a good business idea: spend a lot of money opening up a post office. That's not a declining market, right? #debatenight
Trump is proud, we get it. He is endorsed by many... Brag... Brag... Brag. Is this about him or America? #DebateNight
So ironic that Donald Trump's two most commonly used phrases are "believe me" and "unbelievable". #Debates2016
#debatenight  Good for Hillary - pointing out that not paying any income taxes ("makes me smart" he says) does not support our country.
#debatenight Hillary Clinton has caused ALL our problems!  She's an incredibly powerful woman. Definitely want her to be President.
He remembers all the interviews he wants to remember, selective memory? #debates2016
"Cyber *sniffle* is hardly do-able but it's something we need to be doing" -Donald Trump 😂😂👍 #debatenight
First he will release tax return, then says he will release if Hillary releases all the private emails. #Debates

I can't believe I lived long enough to watch a Cylon malfunction on live TV #debatenight
Wow! I called the President a liar and a fake for years and now "I say nothing". Wow! #Debates2016
"We don't have people that know what they're doing." -@realDonaldTrump on US military experts. #America  #debates
Maybe when there are Lincoln-Douglas style debates will I bother. The intent of these is not primarily to inform one knowledgeably.
Maybe we don't have the money because you haven't paid any income taxes. #debatenight
The single greatest threat under a potential Trump presidency is nuclear threat. #debatenight
"A man who can be provoked by a tweet should not have his fingers anywhere near the nuclear code." *mic drop* 🙌🏻🙌🏻🙌🏻 #debatenight  #debates
You know it's killing him not to say, "I'll take your top down, honey." #debatenight
This debate is hard to watch, like high school kids fighting with each other #Debates2016
"I have a much better temperament than she does" after spending over an hour interrupting and arguing. He's just delusional #debatenight
"According to a thought I just thinked, we owe Mars Twelveteen Zillion Blurons." #debatenight
Just making a list with @whit_lane of the people Trump has offended within the last hour. #lostcount #debatenight

#debates  Donald Trump's nasal snorting is really annoying me. Can't you breathe, dude?
"Stop &amp; frisk --&gt; murder reduction" I'd like to see the data to back that direct causation you're claiming, Trumpy #debatenight
Keep people in school. Give parents the resources to keep kids off the street and out of gangs.. #Debates
She can't just change he laws, and you're a con artist. #debatenight
"We can't just say "Law &amp; Order", we have to have a plan." Hilary better preach. #debates
@HillaryClinton  #DebateNight is an insult to the 62% of America that wanted to #LetGaryDebate the real issues. #substance
Think Trump may have just blamed Baron for the DNC hack? #Debates #Debates2016
Our collective security arrangements have helped to keep us safe for decades. #Debates #Debates2016
"That makes me smart" -Trump. With regards to not paying taxes #DebateNight #Bigly
Donald Trump is saying "different places" more than Elizabeth Berkeley does in Show Girls #Debates2016
I don't know what he just said and that is the true way I feel, THE TRUE WAY I FEEL #debatenight
Yes thank you donald for ruining the post office building and renting out rooms for $350 a night you piece of shit #Debates2016
Donald Trump and these STORIES sounding like fake Mediatakeout headlines!  I. Simply. CANNOT!!  #DebateNight
I want a gif series of Hillary's stank faces and eye rolls during this debate. #debate #Debates2016
Did that son of a bitch bring up stop &amp; frisk?!?! #debatenight
"I got him to produce his birth certificate, not anyone else, me. Congratufuckinlations to me." #trump #debatenight
No he did not just say he has a better temperament. Is he crazy? No for real, is he? #debatenight
"The oil" is not somewhere in a basket guarded by gnomes #debatenight
I'm an atheist, but please, whatever deity is out there, please, open the flood gates #DebateNight
Did he say Palm beach a tough community and one of the wealthiest community in the same damn sentence?? #whatsinhiscup #debatenight #foh
Reality: @HillaryClinton you will never get rid of ISIS. Someone will replace them, like dictators are. A waste of money. #DebateNight
".. our first black president is not an American citizen" Secretary Clinton just went birther again. #Debates #DebateNight
Trump lying about his taxes again.  Is this what we want to be President?  #Liarinchief #imwithher #Debates2016
LOL...Donald tells Lester he's wrong on stop and frisk and yet Lester has the facts right in front of him. #debatenight
This cotton headed, orange glowing son of a bitch has no idea how to be honest. How did we allow this ass to get so far? #debatenight
This debate is getting real😂.                  #debatenight
Stop and frisk may become more necessary when EVERYONE can get a gun. #debatenight
Just like the Super Bowl, I'm recording the debate tonight for the commercials. #debatenight #Debates2016  #debates
Hillary's face right now is EV!ER!Y!THING!!! #debatenight #debates. Who you gonna call? Sean Hannity?
How come he gets away w talking for that long &amp; ignoring Lester so many times when he tries to do his job &amp; actually moderate? #debatenight
@realDonaldTrump You know what other ghettos had an effective stop and frisk policy? The ones in 1930s Germany. #debatenight #workedgreat
@KeithOlbermann if he doesn't stop drinking water he'll need a potty break #debatenight
#debatenight donald said excuse me. Wow first time for everything i guess! Surprisingly he had a first time for those words
Workout plan: Do a push-up every time Trump interrupts Clinton. Do a crunch every time Clinton laughs at Trump. #debatenight
No matter who you support, you have to admit that Clinton is the only candidate that is actually giving legitimate answers #debatenight
"You dont learn that much from tax returns". - Trump   🤔 What bro??? #debatenight
@GermaniJourno Trump believes Law and Order will fix our issues in Racial Inequalities and Racial Violence. #Debates2016
Clinton praises Barack Obama and says that birth certificate accusations by Trump were cruel. #Debates2016 #JOUR3001
I don't think that Trump has said the word 'huge' yet during the debate. Is this his plan to be more presidential? #Debates2016 #JOUR3001
No, Hillary. That "they" vs "us" binary has got to go. #debatenight #Debates2016 #debates
But to stop and frisk is a violation of privacy. So, a male cop stopping your wife @RealTrump2016 and frisking her as he pleases #Debates
Fairly certain that Trump is under the influence of cocaine right now. #debatenight
I find myself torn between laughing hysterically and muttering "what?!" every time Trump speaks.  #debatenight
"There's a person with a temperament that has a problem" WTF? #debatenight
He (i refuse to even speak his name) doesn't stay on topic, stammers when busted in an untruth AND doesn't pay federal taxes #debatenight
@Sabeda1 @reddit  we need someone to make a graph showing how long each person spent speaking. Even the moderator. #debatenight #debates
I'm starting to think Trump can't go more than five minutes without stroking his own ego. Such a fragile individual. #debatenight
Is there a channel that has a fact checker scroll for the #debates ?
Did Clinton suggest that government can work better then a business? Please tell me that isn't what she really meant.  #debatenight #debates
Trump laments paying too much for roads. Why aren't all those GOP governors doing better? #debates
@cenkuygur What's w/ that fake 'I'm listening' facial expression &amp; head nodding Trump is giving? It's like pretend listening. #debatenight
Wait did he say that China should invade North Korea? Wha...? #Debates2016
My cat just jumped on the TV stand and pawed Trump in the face. It was amazing. #debates
30 years fighting ISIS 15 years under audit  Not sure #debatenight Donald

@realDonaldTrump is the only candidate on stage who voted 4 Ryan Gosling as most hunkiest hunk for the 2015 kids choice awards #Debates2016
Yes @realDonaldTrump  African Americans have been abused in this country, some of them by your own supporters. #DebateNight
Trump thinks he's Judge Dread. No, you are not the law. #debates #debatenight
Wait pause, if she was there before she has a sense of how things are done. Where you there?.... No o.okay.❗ #Debates2016
I just heard a voice.  Is there a mediator there?! #debatenight @HillaryClinton
I just heard a voice.  Is there a moderator there?! #debatenight @HillaryClinton
Hillary’s plan is based on decades of listening to families and communities that have been left out and left behind. #debates  #debatenight
trump needs to take an intro to stats class. ahem confounding variable. #debates #debatenight
Hillary is all talk, I feel like Trump will really do what he says #debatenight
Why are we discussing Obama's birth certificate?  How is this a presidential debate issue in 2016?  #Debates2016
"Ill take the admirals and generals over the political hacks any day." Well said @realDonaldTrump  #debatenight
ill never be able to grasp the fact that one of these imbeciles will be running the country #debatenight
Clinton calls birther wank a "racist birther lie" and calls Trump racist. She's on a roll. #debatenight
Lmao Trump implies he's not running a negative campaign against Hillary #debatenight
The amount of times she blinks when he speaks, you'd think she thinks it'll make him disappear. #Debates2016
@realDonaldTrump is deleting tweets the same as deleting emails? Asking for a friend #debatenight
someone fact check this please, i have no reason to believe anything of his is a year ahead of schedule #debatenight #trumptrashing
o yes, i Can see it in Every Single WHITE PERSON AT EACH OF YOUR RALLIES #debatenight #trumptrashing
This debate looking like the white version of a Empire episode #Debates2016
Birther Birther Birther Birther Birther Birther Birther Birther Birther Birther Birther Birther Birther Birther  #Debates2016 #debatenight
Letting trump around nukes is like keeping a baby around a hot stove #debatenight
This #debatenight is really interesting. More terrifying than AHS. Step up your game to this kind of level, FX.
Trump feels so entitled to have the last word and if you try to tell me that misogyny isn't part of that I will laugh in your face. #debates
BUSH WAS THE ONE FIRING THE WHOLE IRAQ MILITARY WHO THEN LATER FORMED ISIS YOU MORON #debatenight
I think Mr. Trump just accused me of preparing 4 this debate. Yes, I did. And you know what, I also prepared for being POTUS. #debatenight
"U know what else I prepare for? I prepare to be president." Hillary with the block!!!  #debatenight
How is it smart to be a tax dodger? It's shitty.  #debatenight
So we know @realDonaldTrump has never been to a third world country? #Debates2016
Dur, it was smart for @realDonaldTrump to not pay those people. More money for @realDonaldTrump = smart. #debatenight
I know it was like 6 minutes ago already, but remember when @realDonaldTrump admitted he doesn't pay taxes? #Debates2016
CCTV_America: RT lisachiuster: 1st mention of Clinton emails in #debatenight #debates2016 Trump: I will release my taxes when she releases …
Did I just hear "bragadocious"? Even though the sound of it is something quite atrocious #debatenight
I wasnt planning on getting drunk tonight....but this debate is too much to handle sober #BringOnTheWine #Fucktrump #debatenight
So wait, in the midst of a war he claims he didn't support, Trump feels we should have stolen oil from sovereign nations? #debatenight
I love, love, love how @HillaryClinton is handling this topic. We need to get at the root of racism, not ignore it. #Debates
And the audience laughs spontaneously when Trump says he's has the best temperament #debatenight
That's my new line when someone calls me out on something: "Wrong." #debatenight
Trump has to bring up ISIS during a debate on the national economy by the only language he knows is fear. #debatenight
@KySportsRadio seems like it is mostly substance vs style. I wish @ShannonTheDude could just do #TeamChester audio drops during #debatenight
I have a hard time believing that Clinton or Trump truly understand the race topic.  #debatenight
If both of these two were Pinocchio, there would be audience members getting impaled by their noses #debatenight
81% of #AfricanAmerican students who earn a BA leave school with the debt... #DebateNight we need @HillaryClinton
Donald will fire the TSA and hire the mob. He goes for the lead-pipe and strong-arm. #debate2016 #debatenight
I feel like I'm being mind fucked by a quick change artist.... what is he even saying and how did he get there #debates
Someone please compile Black Twitter's roast of Donald's "burnt leave out" and "sad lace front." #debatenight
Hillary just fact checked Trump on who approved the American troops leaving Iraq. Bush not Obama she said. #Debates
I think Trump needs to go back in 1985 to The Soviet Union and train for next debate.#debatenight
Donald Trump winging it. He was rambling on &amp; on about how great his business is. Is this a pres debate or a Trump commercial? #debatenight
Did Donald trump just groan? Out loud? in reaction to Hillary? What did press do to Al Gore for rolling his eyes? #debatenight
Does anyone know the Donald's current pants on fire rating for this debate #debatenight  👖 🔥
Paying no federal taxes when you're a billionaire isn't smart, it's being a freeloader. #debatenight
We should drink anytime Hillary is smiling in order to not laugh, but we’d all be dead. #Debates #Debates2016
Trump: “I have much better sense than she does.“  Let me guess, because she’s a woman? #Debates #Debates2016
THIS MAN JUST FUCKING SAID HE HAS A GOOD TEMPERAMENT. BRO YOU SEND ANGRY TWEETS AT 3AM I FEEL LIKE IM TAKING CRAZY PILLS HERE #debatenight
I would love to hear the debate that Trump is tuned into. #debates
"Everybody in the mainstream is going to say it's not true. It's true' says Trump. Well, that takes care of that  #debatenight
"I get audited almost every year, but other people don't" Yes, because your finances are SKETCHY AS HELL #debatenight
"Donald started his career in 1973 being sued by the justice department for racial discrimination" - Yes!! #debatenight
So Donald Trump thinks Dorchester, Roxbury, Hyde Park, Mattapan, are all "hellscapes". Wooooow. #debates
We need law and order. That's the way to stop police killing unarmed black people. #debatenight
Trump is sweating bullets and Clinton's make up is literally matte af. #debatenight
My family is so good with computers they built my website which is so beautiful...currently down, but beautiful! #debatenight #debates
There is gonna be so much booze consumed in this country after the debates tonight. So much.  #debatenight
The birth issue of Barack Obama and Trump's refusal to admit the President was born in America, now on the debate #Debates2016
.@realDonaldTrump is right -- we need NEW, imaginative, #business - like thinking, not people who’ve caused the problems! #debates
I believe in community policing...Stop and a Frisk was found to be unconstitutional.  HRC #debatenight #thankyou
I've never been a Donald Trump fan, but I think he's done more than hold his own tonight! #debatenight
STOP BEING A CHILD!!!! THIS IS A PRESIDENTIAL DEBATE!!! ANSWER THE DAMN QUESTION #debatenight
Get out of the way, I'm trying to read what's written on the wall! #debatenight #debates
In the meantime, Hillary makes carbon-copy promises from yes-we-can Obama era. More boring than telemarketing tv ads. #debatenight
#debatenight Who believes a word she says? She's worse than the lying snake!! She's a professional deceiver.
Just what we need. More idiots at college just to drink and get useless degrees. #DebateNight #PresidentialDebate
his whole strategy is to jump from topic to topic and avoid answering any real questions. he is certifiably insane.  #Debates
Live in a mostly black &amp; brown Carribbean suburb in south FL, never been shot? 🤔 But maybe I'm not doing it right #debatenight
'Systemic Racism' is a very new thing in a presidential debate. Impressive even, sadly. 'Law and Order' is 1968 George Wallace. #debatenight
#DonaldTrump brings up the "super predator" comment but fails to discuss his own call for the execution of the Central Park Five. #debates
Having Trump acting as his own hype man is like a criminal on trial serving as his own lawyer.  #DebateNight
I can't watch this shit. Toddlers and Tiaras is less offensive. #Debates2016   #Trumpisabully #goodluckamerica
Trump's financial statements for Hillary's emails? Sounds fair to me.  #Debates2016 #PresidentialDebate
OOF. Trump almost said "MAINSTREAM MEDIA". It came out as "mainstrea-uhmm (cont. talking). That would've been bad.  #Debates2016
HILLARY IS ALL SMUG BECAUSE LESTER IS ATTACKING TRUMP LIKE CANDY CROWLEY...  MO LESTER HOLT NEEDS TO BE FIRED #DEBATENIGHT
"I say nothing. I say nothing." You're right Trump. You say nothing. #PresidentialDebate #Debates2016
"We need law and order"-@realDonaldTrump in light of race relations in America. Brings up #stopandfrisk #Debates2016
"In #NYC under #stopandfrisk dropped from 2000 murders a year to 500" -@realDonaldTrump is this right or wrong? #factcheck2016 #Debates2016
I love how two white people are talking about black people right in front of a black person. 🙃 #Debates2016
He refers to Charlotte as a "lovely city" because he has investments there.. How is this relevant ?! #debatenight
Trump will talk about stiffing workers and birtherism...but is going to completely miss the golden cyber warfare opportunity. #debatenight
Stop and frisk, take away their guns, where's the NRA when you need them. #debates
I refuse to believe Donald Trump is real. He has to be a figment of our imaginations. NO ONE can be this fucking insufferable. #debatenight
We should take a break so @realDonaldTrump can do a line, he is tweaking!  #sniff #Debates2016
"We need to move on."- Lester Holt. Every time Trump doesn't stop rambling about off topic subjects. #debatenight
Oh dang he is going there on stop and frisk.  #Debates
Stop and frisk does not work "very well." It's unconstitutional if not based on reasonable suspicion. #Debates2016
Crazy low scores in @FrankLuntz focus group of undecided voters for Trump saying he has a better temperament than Clinton #debatenight
"I'll get to Pennsylvania ave one way!" Lmao even Trump knows he's losing #debatenight
I rarely can get just one cat in my lap. Tonight both are. The #debates can be scary.
American military forces are not mercenaries Trump. Stop with the Bull S*it already #debates #DonaldTrump #HilaryClinton
Should Trump be bragging that he's being audited nonstop for the past 15 years? Even Al Capone only got audited once. #debatenight
I'm sure this debate has caused at least 1 #Kardashian 2 think hmm maybe I can run 4 Pres 2 #USPresidentialDebate #facepalm #debatenight
Clinton's team is fact checking. Trump's team is deleting tweets that show he's lying #debates
#Debates2016 Trying to use superpredator is weak. Esp when you push a stop &amp; frisk plan  &amp; you took out a full pg re accused black youth
WE KNOW WE NEED LAW AND ORDER BUT YOU BLAMING RACIAL INJUSTICE ON OBAMA, @realDonaldTrump!? GTFO #debatenight
Someone tell this idiot that a audit doesn't mean you can't release your tax return. #debatenight
Is it just me or does Trump keep sniffing a lot? #Debates2016
Why does Trump care about NATO money if he hasn't paid any taxes to chip into it? #debatenight
Hillary finally called him racist!!! Now she giving the racist receipts! #debatenight
Unbelievable. Not commenting on the debate, I'm just repeating Don's rebuttals. #Debates2016
wooo.... DT had problems with the Cyber segment. ... happy to learn that his 10 yr old son is great with computers #debates
"YOU'RE WRONG" LITERALLY DENYING FACTS IN REAL TIME WHAT IS THIS DEBATES #debatenight
The police obviously aren't afraid to do anything if they're out here killing innocent people for nothing.   #Debates2016
Almost tired of tweeting this thing. What a mess. A total mess. #debatenight
I have a much better temperament.....really when you've been interrupting her the entire night...#debatenight #PresidentialDebate
I'm getting the sense that Trump is really starting to crash and burn now #debates
Ok if there's no problem then release your tax returns. 🙄 #debates
Donald sighs when he knows he messed up. This is one of the facts of the debate. #debates
@wilw   #CPD #debates #GaryJohnson  should be here. This is a partisan dog and pony show. The American Public loses. #LetGaryDebate
Canada are you ready for me in January just in case! #DebateNight
Just got to see @HillaryClinton and her best shit eating grin of the night #debatenight
So #dipshitDon said2 hillary"if ya really wanna know the truth"just proof that the1st thing out of his mouth is always a lie!! #debatenight
Trump's debate tactic is apparently just denying anything he's ever done or said. 🤔 #Debates2016
Drink every time Trump tells either Hillary or Lester Holt they're wrong #debatenight
Trump couldn't be more right, we are in a bubble and the FED is acting politically. #debatenight #RedNationRising
I have a feeling Hillary doesn't interrupt Donald so he can talk himself into a bigger hole #debatenight #Debates2016
I'm sure we'll be reading the transcripts of these debates like we do Lincoln-Douglas debates.
Why does O birth MATTER ANYMORE! BTW Hillary's best friend sued in 2008 2 get O out on his birth. Go read the file She is a birther #debates
all he talks about who he's endorsed by and who invested in what and how proud he is of himself #debatenight
The moderator needs to have a button to cut mics off #Debates2016
Is Trump wanting to turn the US foreign policy into an extortion racket? #Debates
HRC, "I'm preparing to be president of the United States." &lt;mic drop&gt;#debatenight #PresidentialDebate #HillaryClinton #Trump
I think Hillary might actually be filing her nails underneath her lectern. #debatenight
Certain people in my party want to give certain rights to people on watch lists.  WHICH RIGHTS. #debatenight
Uh, race question. Where's her hotsauce? I don't feel no ways tired... #debatenight
He COULD be hiding something, and we can never be too safe. What could Trump be hiding? #PresidentialDebate #Debates2016
That cyber sure is horrible. Just terrible that cyber is.  #debatenight
"I want to take guns away." - "No, I want to take guns away!" "No I said that first!"   #Debates
Is Palm Beach really the wealthy community in the world? I mean it's nice, but come on? #Debates
Nobody wants to call Sean Hannity. I am sure this is true. #debatenight
Can he get through the debate without calling her Crooked Hillary?  #debates
My kid has figured out that the man is talking more. Moderator fail. #debatenight
So happy and even more grateful to be Canadian right now 🇨🇦 #debatenight #PresidentialDebate #LawAndOrder
@ABC #HillaryClinton is compromised by 100's of millions in foriegn donors, yet attackes @realDonaldTrump on Federal taxes. #debatenight
#Debates2016 Trump has to add in- I have investments there, I have properties there, I have businesses there.Who Cares!!
I hope tonight is a clear reason why prep is crucial for success, kids. #debatenight
Yes that does make him smart. And makes him the best to close tax loops #debates
I am more worried about what she is hiding then his taxes.  #debates
@HFA Takes control of debate!!  @realDonaldTrump is a child and a perfect GOP candidate! Yelling, interrupting.  GOP in Freefall#debatenight
Trump says his best asset is his temper. Everybody in the room laughs. 😂😂😂 #debatenight
Aaaaaaaaand I'm out. I can't handle him. If he wins, we're all fucking doomed. #Debates2016
"You know what else I prepared for? I prepared to be president." Ohhhhhhh snap. #Debates2016 #cbsnreax
@realDonaldTrump has RUN OUTTA GAS !! this is equivalent to watchin pacquio fight may weather at this point. #debatenight #HillaryClinton
Apparently it's fine to have been racist as long as "lots of other people were doing it too" #debatenight
Donald Trump doesn't really understand how #debates work.  Does he know he's not debating @LesterHoltNBC ?
Love how Hillary is calmly listening to the ranting. Sean Hannity as his witness #debatenight
Fact Check, Hillary - crime in NYC under Rudy fell significantly during stop and frisk #Debates2016
Donald has now plugged hotel/clubs in DC and Florida - Presidential QVC #Debates2016
Did he just suggest that he cares about Charlotte because he has investments there? #letstalkaboutrace #debatenight
Imagine a #trump madlib.'The tremendous man created tremendous jobs til crooked hillary destroyed #tremendous economy' #clown #debatenight
listening to Trump in this debate is making me lose brain cells... this man is something else #debatenight
I honestly don't even know what the heck he was just talking about... #Debates2016
"My dick is bigger"- Hillary  "No, my dick is bigger"- Trump              "You're both dicks." - Lester #debatenight
I can't watch this "debate" anymore. She is full of crap &amp; he is driving me nuts with his faces and bragging #debatenight #tcnt #jackandben
"I prepared to be president... and I think that is a good thing" lmfaoo #LyingHillary #debates #WhereIsGary
TRUMP JUST SAID STOP AND FRISK WORKS. WTF IS HE ATILL DOING UP THERE. HE LITERALLY KNOWS NOTHING  #debatenight
If you've been drinking every time Trump says "disaster", you're lit right now #debatenight
Is the guy filling @realDonaldTrump water glass also leaving him booger sugar? What's he sniffing and why is he so agro? #debatenight
A is getting angry at me because i keep doing the Law and Order theme song when he's trying to listen #debatenight
On race: Clinton talks education &amp; justice, Trump law &amp; order #debatenight
On foreign policy, @realDonaldTrump focuses on what he said about Iraq War, @HillaryClinton focuses on policy. #ApolloUptownHall #Debates
"super predator" can you stop saying that word pls? it's been like 2 decades guys, and she's already addressed it to. #debatenight
#debatenight Hillary: racially too many of us jump to conclusions about each other, especially Pilipinos.
So is Trump's aggression right now a positive or negative? Is he overarching or is he strategically trying to shake Hillary? #Debates2016
#debatenight Poor Lester. I wouldn't want to be in his position right now.
We don't need new airports. You think we need to waste money on frivolous gold colored buildings. @realDonaldTrump. #payyourtax #debatenight
Most of us agreed with the war in Iraq.. but we were all on a need-to-know basis. And most of us didn't know #debatenight
What will end violence is justice&amp;  equality not "law and order" stop &amp; frisk- not just discriminatory it's unconstitutional! #Debates2016
#debatenight DONALD SUPPORTED IRAQ AND LIBYA. NOT WRONG. Trump you can't deny forever.
Is hillary talking about dt taxes or her emails that are scary  #DebateNight
WTF? Stop and frisk was found to be unconstitutional b/c it was in part ineffective? C'mon Hillary. #debatenight #debates
Since when has the amount of money you turn over to the government decide your level of patriotism? #Debates2016
The fact that birtherism is still being talked about is disgraceful. #debatenight
trump tellin you that his Tax Returns are coming is like you telling some street random that you'll 'def' check out his mixtape #debates
Here it comes. Trumps is going to step in it on race. Blow it big time. #debatenight
Whoever comes out as favorite from this #debatenight I just pray my fellow Africans will be safe and less affected. Both seems unfavorable
#Debates Hillary doesn't want to spend tax dollars repairing our infrastructure. She wants to use that money to destroy other countries.
Trump says he wants to fight isis and other things. You should been worried about that instead of Obama's birth certificate 🙄😑 #debates
Trump is making up more bullshit again. He wants to steal Iraqi oil and that is illegal. He supported the war and said so on video. #Debates
He just doesn't have the temperament for this,  and by "He" I mean Lester Holt. #debates2016
yes, and Trump is all action, no think, forget about talk.  #Debates
"I have property there" is what passes as empathy for #Trump.  Pathetic.  #Debates2016
I feel like I'm the only one not watching the debates
Given the political climate in the US right now, that will probably hurt Hillary more than Trump. #debates
#Hillary #debates2016 yes she getting it she on point and she has accurate facts raise taxes for wealthy to build the lower class make equal
Nuclear is our greatest threat like POC not getting murdered by police almost every day..#debates
Hillary can continue to make Americans doubt or question Trump's taxes forcing his hand. Well played. He's far to arrogant #Debates2016
Americans. This is our fault. We've gotta own these two decisions we've made... #Debates2016
Bankruptcy, no charity don, didn't claim n the right tax bracket, he wants power to run middle class and poor deeper n debt #debatenight
#debatenight   @HillaryClinton says nukrs #1 threat in the world...  beg to differ, climate change is an equally great threat.  #ImWithJill
Should have started a drinking game at the beginning of the #Debates2016 . Every time #43 is used as a scapegoat you take a drink.  🍻
can we pls talk about POC w/o immediately talking about gun legislation? i believe the initial question was about racism #debates2016
Hilary, keep firing Trump's ass up and make a bigger fool of him than he's already done himself #debatenight
Donald has NO substance! He just wants to argue and pick apart someone..that's not what a president does.. #debatenight
@realDonaldTrump Pres. Obama  @BarackObama is the POTUS and not just "your" president! #debatenight
HE HAD NO BUSINESS HAVING TO PRODUCE HIS BIRTH CERTIFICATE IN THE FIRST PLACE. #WeTooAreAmerica #debatenight
I just don't know how much longer I can watch this before my entire body explodes in protest #debatenight
#Debates  So this is what dinner time at the Trumps is like.
He's just making @HillaryClinton look better every time he opens his mouth #debates
She is adequately making him look stupid but in a way that his supporters will find condescending. I don't feel well. #DebateNight
#debatenight is littt 🔥🔥 (no but seriously fam kindly tune in for the future of the world)
You need more police.That way you can have more stopping and frisking. Let's all break the constitution and make a #party of it!#DebateNight
Let's make Hillary and Donald play Monopoly and whoever wins can be president #debatenight
@LesterHoltNBC you are supposed to CONTROL the debate not sit there and do NOTHING #worstmoderator  #debatenight #debatenj
The room erupts in laughter when Trump says he has a better temperament. #Debates
There you go Donald, Hillary just said LAW and ORDER followed by an intelligent explanation. #debatenight #Debates2016
I think my biggest problem with the debates is that Donald's fan based isn't getting fact checked
Can I get a fact check on Donald's claim that people love him? #debatenight
Textbook Donald to mention a report he just read without mentioning the name of the report..... #debatenight
Quick someone trademark a t-shirt that says bigly and badly before @realDonaldTrump can get the chance. #LetGaryDebate #Debates2016
Hillary, how do you plan on fixing implicit bias? Thought police? #debatenight
Hillary, YOUR campaign back in '07 laid the foundation of the birther issue. #debatenight
Donald Trump is so full of shit. And that shit is so confused, it doesn't know if to come out of his ass or his mouth #upordown #debates
"I will release my tax returns until she releases her 33,000 emails" lmao still never #debatenight
lester: what do you have to say to racial healing trump: I say nothing yikes #debatenight
@megynkelly @realDonaldTrump  #KellyFile #ABC #NBC #debatenight #Debates2016 We can not blame Donald J Trump for Iraq War a private citizen
This debate shows us EXACTLY how Donald will "collaborate" with our allies. #debates
Libertarians are the ones saying the world would be a *little* better if both these ppl had less power. Crazy, I know #Cato2016 #debates2016
This first use question is a trick question. He has no idea what it is! Lester with the kill shot. #debatenight
I thought Hilary was supposed to be the sick one? Trump keeps sniffing like he's been blowing coke for days #debatenight
#debatenight the fed is not political trump, your living in your own delusion
I have businesses in black areas. I have black friends. I can't be racist. 🙃 #Debates2016
@Oregonemom not necessarily true; doesn't mean that either #Hillary or #Trump or good options because they're not #Election2016 #Debates2016
Trump's NYC expert, Rudolph Giuliani, weighs in. Rudolph: "Yeah, crime is up. I think so."  #Debates2016
He really couldn't be more ignorant. Please continue explaining foreign affairs to the frmr Secretary of State. #debatenight #TrumpIsStupid
She is in trouble did not just open door to Wall Street #debatenight
.@realDonaldTrump, why haven't you brought your money &amp; jobs back if it's so important? It's because you don't care. #debatenight #debates
I cannot take anyone who doesn't think global warming isn't an issue seriously. Seriously?  #Debates
I Would Love Too See a Woman President...Just Not Killary LOL #debatenight #MakeAmericaGreatAgain #ImWithHim
@johniadarola she is letting him literally implode but she needs to be so much more in his face #debates
@realDonaldTrump, "Because of @BarackObama , we have lost control of things we used to" #Debates #YoSender
Hillary vs Trump debate  Hillary = Turd Sandwich Trump =  Giant Douche #SouthPark #debatenight #Debates2016
Barack at home like " thank God I'm done with this BS". #DebateNight
"I've been under audit for 15 years."  "I'll release the returns when it's done." How long is that shit gunna be?  #Debates
Trump is such a shitty debater and Hillary looks like a fucking alien #debatenight
I feel like my head is going to explode, listening to Trump. Who the hell would vote for this idiot?!? #debatenight
"I have a much better temperament than she does." Oh my Gawd! #debatenight
US Millenials...THIS should matter to you. Please pay attention to what could happen to your country. #VOTE #bewithher #debatenight
Neither of these canadates are speaking confidently on the issue if race tonight. What does that mean to you Murica? #debatenight
Hillary heart must have sunk when the words #SuperPredator came out tonight. #debatenight
No 👏 he 👏 did 👏 NOT 👏 just brag about his temperament #debatenight
Trump: we have to take the guns away from bad people #Debates2016
We need @JRsBBQ to moderate the debates. We have a real slobberknocker going on. #debatenight
Can anyone see either Hilary or Donald lasting for two terms as President? #debatenight #OneTermPresident
The biggest question Lester missed tonight is who's sporting the most hair dye and hair spray? #FactCheckTheDebate #debatenight #Debates2016
@HillaryClinton has been in politics a very long time with no accomplishments but this time she will fix it all? Wake up Merica #debatenight
I do love that @HowardStern stern made it into the presidential debate. #debatenight
Trump will create many a job for those who can hack into ISIS #debates
But honestly, there are only shots being thrown and opinions from Trump no fact. #Debates2016
@realDonaldTrump winning winning winning! Let the hack regurgitate memorised talking points! We going to MAGA #debatenight #debates
I did a service getting Obama to show his birth certificate! If Hillary was as good she'd get me to show my tax return!#debatenight #LoudYam
"I have a much better temperament than clinton" *light chuckling amongst everyone else" #Debates2016
Donald Trump, who wondered aloud about the possible assassination of his opponent, is now accusing her of disrespecting Obama. #debatenight
How are you great at business if you keep hiring people who did unsatisfactory work? #debatenight
Q: Why is Obama’s birth certificate being brought forward for conversation? This has nothing to do with politics… #APUSH220 #Debates2016
How are you going to tell the moderator he is wrong? I'm pretty sure he did his homework before the #debates. #debatenight #Debates2016
Trump loves China so much, he's prob'ly got the word tattooed on his dick b/c he wants to fuck it so much #debatenight #debates #Debates2016
"Implicit bias is not just a police issue" - America in a nutshell #debatenight #debates #Debates2016
#debatenight wonder when was the last time Hillary talked to a dishwasher....
Anyone else notice that Donald looks like a confused puppy when Hilary is talking? #DebateNight #PresidentialDebate
So the solution to the very real racial divide in our country is... Law and order? So we arrest systemic racism? #debatenight
It was a mistake to play the "Michael Jackson Popcorn Gif Drinking Game". I am currently on dialysis 🤒 #debatenight
@realDonaldTrump The US is a 3rd world country?Let's take a trip to Haiti or a REAL 3rd world country outoftouch  #debatenight #Debates2016
"I built a great company... an unbelievable company" how does that qualify you to be our President? #debatenight
Someone please get a petition to have @MichaelRapaport moderate the rest of the debates
Stop and frisk was declared unconstitutional.  Trump is pointing to Chicago to justify his fear mongering. #debatenight
Did anyone keep a "Sean Hannity" count? Was it as high as Trump's opinion of his own temperament? #debatenight #Debates2016
Can someone fact check Trump's "I have common sense" line? Thanks.  #Debates
So Trump thinks he can bully his way to the election.  #debatenight
Trump: We have to get tough on cyber.  YOU ARE AN IDIOT. #debatenight
Cheers from audience requested to be quiet over HCs missing emails #debatenight
Clinton accusing Trump of having something to hide.   Ummmmm.......e-mails? Hello? #Debates
this distinction between the trickle down economics of @realDonaldTrump and the broad approach by @HillaryClinton is key. #DebateNight
And look at both of these lying mfs  everything the sayin lies #Debates
how will he be allowed to be president if he wasn't a citizen ?   Trump Stfu  #debatenight
#Debates2016 #debatenight "you did this, well you did this, well no you this, no your doing this" rabblerabblerrabble
#debatenight  Hillary more relaxed - did Trump pay tax? For troops?  etc
The last person to speak for the black community is Donald Trump #debatenight
Holt: 'how you you stop the violence?' Trump: 'The violence is bad.' #debatenight
Watching like, who are the 22% of Latinxs who DON’T have a negative view of Trump? #debatenight
This is really just a really long and expensive Gary Johnson commercial. #LetGaryDebate #debatenight
'Because of my massive and frequent financial fraud I get audited frequently' #debatenight
Amazed that it's such a close #debatenight It's #Hillary's emails vs #Trump's tax returns dominating it so far #Debates2016
Don't be bragging about finding loopholes so that you don't have to pay any taxes #debatenight
HILLARY A TALKING POINT #BOT  HILLARY A TALKING POINT #BOT  HILLARY A TALKING POINT #BOT  HILLARY A TALKING POINT #BOT  #DebateNight
#debatenight Bottom line: if more people are hopeful about the USA, Hillary wins. It more people are fearful about the USA, Trump wins.
"I mean, his contour's on point but he looks like a scrotum. You can't escape that." #ShitBreeSays #Debates2016
Hilary just got the young African American and young latino vote #debatenight #Debates2016
Why are we discussing Trump's business? What does that have to do with our country? #debatenight
"My biggest asset is my temperament" 😂😂😂😂 entire audience LOLs. He is such a joke #debatenight
Great Hillary line: "too many for too long for too little" #crime  #Debates2016
no point made thus far for me from trump on the race debate #Debatenight
Did Hillary just say she took out Osama bin Laden? Let's talk about Benghazi, Hillary. #Debates2016
We know, they had a REAL hard time renting in OUR buildings #debates
Trump, the people watching this do not know what "under-leveraged" means.  Speak to the people, not your golfing buddies.  #DebateNight
He focuses on his business. Business in America is cut-throat due to laws Clinton helped pass. Get the money out of politics. #debatenight
"You decided to stay home, and that's ok."  Hillary's canned comeback is really lame. #debatenight
"...the record shows otherwise." Could be said about most of things that Trump spews out. #DebateNight
RT Side fact Law &amp; Order also @realdonaldtrump favorite tv show just after the apprentice and the rich and famous #stardebate #debatenight
He wants law and order in the streets but chaos in the debate #Debates
*Everyone*: "I don't normally talk about politics but... #debatenight"  Me: *does nothing because I don't really care about y'all's opinion*
This is good shit from Clinton re: trump stiffing working class stiffs ! #debatenight #debates2016 #debates
Donald Trump's hair looks like a Kangol hat made out of cotton candy. #debatenight
I blame this election cycle for every celeb death that's occurred during it. It's frankly a wonder any of us are still alive. #debatenight
Allies do not pay their dues to @NATO Fact Check @realDonaldTrump is right  #Debates2016
Go Trump..  Why pay for bad work if it's the government she would have payed double since it's not her money #Debates
"Over that last little while" The best quote of the night. Black people everything's fixed #Debates2016 #debatenight
Death &amp; Taxes oh wait @realDonaldTrump doesn't pay taxes, so death? Nah, that's the easy way out just vote for @HillaryClinton #Debates2016
The Dems depend on the race divide. They need the votes. After they have them .. kick them to the curb #Debates
Yup.. the black community is continually taken advantage of by the Dems.  #Debates
Hillary acting like a mother patiently ignoring a child throwing a repeated and extended temper tantrum #debates #Debates2016 #debatenight
Clinton is hitting the heart of the criminal justice system problems in America, especially gun control. #debatenight
Trump: Laguardia is a 3rd world country. Once in their private lounge I received a moist towelette that wasn't even that moist #debatenight
And now you support African-Americans and Hispanics? It is too late for that @realDonaldTrump #debatenight
"You know what else I prepared for? I prepared to be president." BLAM #debatenight #ImWithHer
Who ever gets elected will only be a one term president. #debatenight
I wasn't expecting much before I decided to watch this debate. But I swear this is just a slap in the face as a black person #debatenight
I really can't believe this is real life right now. He's really a real presidential candidate. Smh #Debates2016
Honestly, the presidential debates are like a horrible comedy you still laugh at #Debates2016 #makeamericagrateagain
I may be 15, and I may not be as smart as some people but I sure as heck keep up with these flipping politics!!!! #debatenight
Trump supporters aren't even smart enough to follow the debate rules 🙄🙄🙄 #debatenight
Lol if his strongest asset is his temperament then we know why he ain't releasing his tax returns #debates #debatenight
Saying you have a better temperament while you flail around, interrupt, scream and insult like a teenage girl...yeah... #Debates2016
Trump having 1 million dollars to start with is like losing your virginity to Beyonce. #debatenight
Wow; Trump at #Debates2016 is a perfect example why you should always do your homework.
"Do you get audited? I get audited all the time."  - Trump in the buffet line at Mar-a-Lago #debatenight
Surely Trump's secret "bigly" plans are better than Hillary's realistic &amp; specific detailed plans. #debates
Race relations on this debate? I'm intrigued to see the answers. Hillary will pander, Donald will offend. #debatenight #debates
"I think donald just criticized me for preparing for this debate." #gold #debates
Trump: We have no money! [Paid no tax] Trump: That makes me smart #debates
You can make laws all day and it isn't going to stop the "bad people" and the "bad things" #debatenight #Debates2016 #stopandfrisk
#LawAndOrder is that what we need? I thought that was a tv show. #DonTheDunce oversimplifies @HillaryClinton knows the reality #debatenight
Hope body language expert comments on #DonTheDisaster &amp; @HillaryClinton during #DebateNight because Dons sweating bullets #VeniceForHillary
@HillaryClinton why do you not have an American flag pinned to your power suit??? 🤔🇺🇸 #debatenight
CAN WE MOVE ON FROM WHAT SEAN DID OR DID NOT SAY?! #debatenight #PresidentialDebate
Trump says being sued by the Federal Govt. is "just one of those things" Boy go to bed. #debatenight
Hillary uses rehearsed lines with no conviction at #debatenight. Listening to #Trump she looked smug but now is about to cry. #MAGA #debates
Isn't it about time for Sam Seaborn to fulfill Bartlett's prophecy that he'd be in the White House one day? Please? #debatenight
#Debates2016 who cares about wasting time talking about a birth certificate when there are other important topics
Democratic part has sold out America for the "global community". 3rd world gets better, US goes flat/downhill. #debatenight
@seanhannity apparently needs friends guys. Maybe we should all send him someecards. #debatenight
Trump is the student that didn't read what he was supposed to &amp; goes off the top of his head come  time for class discussion #debatenight
Add stop and frisk to the mix of racial profiling ...that's a great idea🙄 #Debates2016
For .@HillaryClinton to take responsibility for her use of a private email server she needs to plead guilty and go to prison #debatenight
I haven't flown in a while. Are our airports that bad? #DebateNight
Stop and frisk was ruled unconstitutional in NY - it's a form of racial profiling ... Trump thinks this is effective gun control #Debates
#DebateNight Trump keeps preaching about the same exact things since he announced he was running does he even have a plan
One thing is clear: @HillaryClinton has solid solutions for our nation's future. @realDonaldTrump is focused on his own future. #debatenight
Trump is letting Hillary go on the offense. Needs to defend himself against every claim. Puts her in driver's seat. #debatenight #debates
How much you want to be that Trump is sniffling so he can blame his failure on a cold? #sympathycard #Debates2016
Why does @realDonaldTrump keep running 1 finger over his mustache area? Is he hoping to grow a small Hitler one? #debatenight #Debates2016
I think Holt (and Lauer before him) is afraid to get yelled at by Trump, which is why he treats him/Lauer treated him so gently #debatenight
Trump has used "fat" at least twice now in derogatory ways. Fat-phobia is real and on display tonight. #debatenight
If cyber security is a big deal for the Potus she better not be technologically challenged like Hillary #Debates2016
Does #Trump even understand who ISIS is?  Does he think all these Middle Eastern terrorist groups are the same group?!? #debatenight
So @realDonaldTrump is saying he has just as much to hide in his tax returns as she does with her e-mails?   #debatenight #maga
Does #Trump even know any black people?? I'm starting to wonder.  He is literally being rude af while discussing this.  #debatenight
Fact checkers are fantastic and more prepared to be president than Trump will ever be. #debatenight
#debatenight  donald go home...bring back Jeb Bush! @JoeNBC  this Trump guy cant be responsible for the saftey of my family!
"One murder is too many" - Clinton, except for the unborn #debatenight

I'm done watching this shitz, if iwanted a mf to lie to my face &amp; icant slap it I'd go get married #DebateNight #debates2016
#debatenight Clinton: " I prepared for this debate and I prepared to be President"
why trust hillarys fact checkers when she lied about the emails lol #debatenight
#debatenight how dare those foriegn countries hack &amp; spy on our citizens, thats our govt's job
I agree. POTUS Trump having access to nuclear codes is more terrifying than climate change #Debates2016
Clinton: The birther lie was a very hurtful one... I could tell how much it bothered [Obama] that it was being used against him #debatenight
It's the law that you can't discriminate in hiring, jackass. You can't take credit for following the law! #debatenight  #maddow
Oh, there it is, take the oil! Like pirates or 18th Century colonialism #debatenight #maddow
I don't know, Donald. You don't believe in paying people if they don't "do a good job." #DebateNight
The woman bought by every crook in the world is lecturing on honesty?! #Debates2016
what if police instead used stop &amp; frisk on all white men in suits in case of white collar crime? would trump still be for it? no. #debates
I don't think that Donald Trump has formed a full coherent thought thus far #Debates2016 #LetGaryDebate
Does @realDonaldTrump have a complete sentence to spare?!? Can someone buy this MF'er a vowel?!? Anything? #debatenight
"And I think you'll agree" *spoken aloud while slicing open palm for blood pact for entry into Trump fan club probably* #debates
Trillions being thrown around like its a dollar at sin city. #imTooBrokeToDebate #debates #debatenight
Promoting stop, frisk &amp; confiscate... BOTH major party presidential candidates are against a strong 2nd Amendment #debatenight #Debates2016
IT WAS NOT A MISTAKE IT WAS PURPOSEFULLY! YES! Preach Hillary - taking "responsibility" would mean going to JAIL.  #debatenight
The debates on at work but I can't hear it    :(  clinton still cersei Lannister tho
These are the longest damn 2 minutes I have ever seen in my life  #debatenight
Soooooo he takes up time fussing about other stuff and then says he wants to talk about the important stuff??!! 😒😒 #DebateNight
So hummm, when is the debate going to really start? Everyone already knows the intricacies of taxes &amp; emails #moveon #debatenight #Imwithher
hillary: clear answers trump: hillary did this bad thing once-  #debatenight
No one can say Holt didn't call out Trump tho, although there wasn't any follow-up. #debatenight
Really thought Trump was going to talk about Fred Schneider when he started in on how old the B-52s are.  Tin roof! Cyber. #debatenight
When someone owns a Marijuana green card, they are not allowed to own a gun #Debates
i have to watch this for POLS, i dont normally give a fuck for politics BUT  god damn are these hilarious  #Debates
Is this a competition to see how much you can "burn" each other? I thought there was a country to run?  #debatenight
Wish I could snap a photo for posterity! Colbert's desk, Trumps smirks, audience cheers and jeers, &amp; beautiful lighting. #LSSC #debatenight
"I've been under audit for 15 years" maybe do your taxes correctly then? -Trump #Debates2016
But what about the "terra" that a piece of shit like you could actually be President? #debatenight #debates #debate2016
Guns are killing people or are people using guns to kill people.  How about teaching respect for life  to end violence #Debates
No biz person would use own $$$ for business expansion. That's what investors are for. Cutting 1%'s taxes = 0 job creation. #debatenight
Hmmm, I think trump just admitted he doesn't pay taxes "it would have been squandered too" #Debates2016
Trump blaming Obama for an issue that started with the Reagan admin giving training and weapons to al Queda #debatenight
"A man who can be provoked by a tweet shouldn't have his fingers near a nuclear trigger" - Hillary Clinton. Amen! #Debates2016
Trump's voice is so nasally and shrill. Why can't he just speak like a man? #debatenight
"I admit I prepared for this debate. I also prepared to be president" - @HillaryClinton #DebateNight #Slay
Can't post the "this is fine" house of fire meme now because the INTERNET IS OUT OF COPIES. #LOLTrump #debates #debatenight "Call Hannity!"
It's 2016 why are we still talking about blacks and they should not be treated different? #debatenight #TrumpVsClinton
I lose brain cells every time trump overuses the words "good" &amp; "bad" #debatenight
Clinton isn't honest, Trump only cares about his ego. This is rough. #debates
She's so superior, he's flipping like a child, with the eloquence of a 3-grader, getting louder and louder.. #Trump's a joke 😂 #Debates2016
hillary just said baghdadi u know she tryin to bait trump into "correcting" her so she can slam the volley #debatenight
.@realDonaldTrump just invented the word of the year - "bragadocious" is a bodacious word! #Debates2016 #ClintonVsTrump
how can you watch this and still support trump?? i'm flabbergasted at his inability to actually answer questions  #debatenight
Also... that little shimmy smile thing Hillary just did... Victory dance 2016 #Debates2016
For Hillary to win this debate, I think she NEEDS to interrupt Trump every once in a while! #debatenight #USPresidentialDebate
Now he is dissing the B-52. The reason why it doesn't need updating is because it is the best bomber ever built. #debatenight
Which magazine?   Specifics and this dude just don’t mix.  #debatenight
We are doing nothing about North Korea...says the guy with no military experience. #debates #Debates2016

"Broken System" It is broken but the "Systemic Racism" doesn't take repeat offenders into account... #debatenight #Debates2016
Those of you who love Hillary I hope you are happy with your welfare checks, because that's where you'll remain #Debates2016
400lbs sitting on their bed? I take offense!  I'm on my couch!  #debatenight
Are you seriously still on this citizenship crap Trump... such a reach... #debatenight
After this debate i need to go to a coke head anonymous meeting #Debates2016 #debatenight
All the 400 pound hackers are going to kick Donald's ass. #debatenight
When white cops are in all black neighborhoods and blacks have been murdering cops,then cops have a reason to be slightly biased #Debates
"It cant be dismissed that easily" is a really important thought re:Trump #debates #birtherism
Trump: "I will protect the second amendment." Trump: "We need to take the guns away from people who use them."  Hm.   #DebateNight
This is the first time I've heard @realDonaldTrump not support proliferation or use of "the nuclear". #DebateNight
Law and Order is one of my alltime favorite shows. Definitely, bring it back. #debatenight
-nuh uhh! -yuh huh! -nuh uhh!!! -yuh!! huh!!!  Out future Presidents, ladies and gents.   #Debates2016
Trump worried about his property in Chicago? I think his 'hood is in decent shape. #debatenight
Wasn't Trump shitting on the US military generals and admirals not too long ago?   #Debates
#Debates2016   "Maybe I'm trying to save the money"  KISS MY ASS DONNIE
You can barely put together a sentence and you come out with #braggadocious? #Debates2016 Is that the one thing you remembered?
Oh well if Sean Hannity says it then it must be true. #debatenight
Well thank you for calling my parents idiots for paying their taxes Donald #debatenight
Like watching two kids at Toys R Us not getting their way. I'd rather elect a trampoline. #debatenight
All jokes aside.. this topic right now is where one of these candidates lose ground. Big time #debatenight
ok I've made a choice, that I feel is very wise, and that is to watch Zootopia and not the #debates ✌🏻️
Trump trying to defend himself and smear Clinton is a what a Thanksgiving dinner with his family sounds like. #debatenight
Trump says NATO countries need to "pay their fair share" but won't release tax records and wants to give tax breaks to wealthy.#debatenight
Clinton: I have a feeling by the end of the night I'm going to be blamed for everything ever. Trump: Why not? Everyone: *laughs #Debates2016
Donald Trump, professional blusterer who has never held government office, says Hillary Clinton is "all talk" #Debates2016
Clinton: Trump just criticized me for preparing for this debate. I did. mic drop Clinton: I also prepared to be prez MIC DROP  #Debates2016
Is Trump both admitting Obama is born in America and giving himself credit for making it an issue when no one cared #Debates2016
#Debates2016 implicit bias is not just a concern for police force it is a concern for everyone. - @HillaryClinton
Undecided voters will finally be able to make a choice based on tonight's debate.  They will determine winner. #debates
"Braggadocios" Trump literally learned that word from Don King a few days ago!  #debatenight
Feels like #believe me" is the new "not here for the right reasons" #DebateNight #Bachelor
Trump argues he's been under audit for 15 years. "It's become a way of life." #debatenight
Cheers for Trump's call for Clinton to release the emails. Lester Holt admonishes the audience. #nocheering on #debatenight
Clinton speculates on why Trump won't release his taxes. Maybe he's paid no income tax? "That makes me smart," Trump says. #debatenight
#debatenight @HillaryClinton has never walked down the street in a real black or Hispanic neighborhood - not enough Secret Service agents
Ask Clinton what happened to the $$ that was supposed to go to the Haitian people??They protested the Clinton Foundation.#debates
Lol! Maybe Trump is just a Luo; not as rich as we think. #debatenight
I find it hilarious how people support hillary just because of the way that the media interprets trump. #MakeAmericaGreatAgain #debatenight
Dear Donald Trump, I know you keep talking about crime but Gotham does not exist in this reality. #DebateNight #Debates2016
He's actually calling the U.S. a "Third World Country" Pro tip: that's not a an acceptable term. #debatenight #Debates2016 #debate
After he started using Sean Hannity as a centering reference, this wasn't really interesting anymore. #debatenight #debates #Debates2016
Trump is that guy who brings up stuff from 1974 every time you have an argument #debatenight #Debates2016
Clinton plugged her website...trumped plugged his hotel. All's fair in debates and business. #debates2016
Hackers! put down the fritos and mountain dew. You were just called fat!...oh...wait...is that pizza? you mind? mmmm.... #debates2016
"I say nothing." ...to the issue of racial healing. #debatenight #birtherism can't be dismissed
#debatenight   - Mr Trump you did ... - I did not ....  is getting old
talking about cyber security now…. you know Trump is going to bring up those emails. #debatenight
You heard it folks. Donald Trump wants to take your guns! #debatenight
I am glad @realDonaldTrump is demanding this, I would love to ignore my own inbox and read 30,000 of @HillaryClinton's emails. #debatenight
In addition to disability being largely ignored, very little discussion of issues specific to elders or #aging. #CripTheVote #debatenight
The next debate I want to see is Trump vs. Lester Holt. Let's make it happen! #debatenight
Finally Hillary brought up his past racism because no one had done it before #debatenight
Ya'll we got two more debates and election night to get through. Damn we in this bitch.
Am I the only one thinking Trump looks incredibly bored when he's not talking? #debatenight
Nothing brings me more joy than hearing my dad cackle from upstairs every time Hillary calmly roasts this lil bitch #DebateNight
I have a winning temperament. it wins bigly. #debatenight are you freaking kidding me?!?!???!
"no discrimination against... Muslims..." didn't you want all Muslims to register for a while? #debatenight
Why bother showing us how you cheated the gov't on your tax returns @realDonaldTrump we already know!  #Debates2016
Trump answers no questions; inserts vague examples; produces hyperbole... But no substantive facts.  #Debates2016
I wish we had a nice moderate candidate. I'm tired of the extremes. #Debates2016
These 2 are really the best we could get? What the fuck. #debatenight
Trump is secretly super relieved @SenSanders isn't the one opposite him on that stage. #debates
What a range of emotions 2nite: 1) watch Dee Gordon homer in 1st at-bat 2 honor #JoseFernandez &amp; 2) observing the #debates via tv &amp; Twitter.
2/2 Fun fact: Black people are also interested in talking about upward mobility #debatenight
And in the Racial Healing segment, @realDonaldTrump continues to discuss @BarackObama's birth certificate. Of course. #debates
Pretty sure a chatbot would be more coherent/factual in a debate than Trump #debatenight
Yes Hilary! Educate Donald some more! Shouldn't argue about something he knows nothing about #debates
Trump "I haven't given a lot of thought to NATO." 'Nuff said  #Debates2016
HE JUST BRAGGED ABOUT NOT PAYING TAXES. HOLY HELL THIS IS AMAZING. #Debates2016 #debatenight #ImWithHer
Chomsky has consistently criticized the neocon war hawk policies Trump is positing. "Smash them with a hammer" has never worked #debates
"This fed, this Janet Yellen," is he running for president or auditioning for Vinny Gambini? #debatenight
Is this suppose to be informative or entertaining? This is way more funnier than it should be 😂. #debatenight
Trump just said he takes advantage of the laws of the country. What will he do as a president then? #Debates2016 #debates
It took Trump about five seconds to fire back after Clinton took responsibility for using a private server #Debates
Did @realDonaldTrump just have the nerve to accuse her of having a holier than thou attitude? #debatenight #Unbelievable
"Obama's birth certificate - I wanna get onto ISIS" - greatest segue ever. Good one Donald. #Debates2016
Trump included Putin, ISIS, his ten-year old son and a 400lb man in one run-on sentence...simply incredible. #Debates2016
I wish Hilary wasn't too classy to be sassy #debatenight. I low key wanna she her snap in Z formation when she claps back.
#debates Did he just say not paying his taxes makes him smart?
Translation: "middle class" 4 Trump= you make merely million dollars  #debates #debatenight #Debates2016

Discrediting Trump as a liar lacks merit - politics is a liars' game - objectives are the distinguishing factor. #Debates2016.
@PeanutButterGmr Dang! Ross, Dodger, now you are talking and retweeting about the #debates ? Glad I'm technically not watching this alone!
Donald go home you are not ready for the big league #ImWithHer #debatenight
My freshmen can do a better argument than this. Critical thinking FTW. #hebroughtupAfAmcommunity #debatenight #justlistentowhatyouheard
I wish the #debatenight was a series. Donald Trump is good at this reality tv stuff. #entertaining
"Law and order" is code for #whitesupremacy --  We white ppl keep the law &amp; ppl of color need to follow our orders UGH #Debates2016
When Donald Trump tells the Black host "You're wrong"... I can see the eye rolls from my couch #Debates2016
"I made him produce his birth certificate" - how does Trump take so much credit for being proven completely wrong? #debates #debatenight
Nuclear is the greatest threat to the world, which is why Trump must not be allowed access to it #debatenight #debates
Well, I made it 35 minutes and I'm done with #debatenight ... Mr. Robot here I come! #saveme
When we have 20$ trillion in debt... And we're a mess.  Let's default like Trump did at his casinos.  #debatenight
Trump on his federal taxes, "It would be squandered too" instead of "it was squandered too". What could that mean? #debates #debatenight
@kylegriffin1 He also admitted he didn't pay federal income taxes. #debates  (Unless he was just careless with the mood of his verb)
Question: How do we handle cyber security? Answer: I've just been endorsed! Catch up @realDonaldTrump! #ImWithHer #Debates2016
Dear World, We have 300 million people and this is the best we could do. I'm sorry.   #debatenight #Debates2016
Trump so regrets ever saying Obama wasn't a citizen. His face every time it comes up KILLS me. 😐 #debates
hey carrot head how does it feel like to be silenced #debates
He was for it. He was against it. He's for or against whatever he thinks will make him look good/benefit him. #Debates2016
I'm not for making voting harder, but anyone who votes Trump shld have to unpack the acronyms for NATO &amp; NAFTA b/c EDUCATION #debatenight

#debates what does the birth certificate have to do with the current presidential race?
Jackass brags about paying zero taxes and then rails against lack of infrastructure. WTF? #debatenight
Hillary - being presidential also means not to let Trump make points #debatenight #debates2016
Glad we know trump is NATO's main advisor; they never give him enough credit #debatenight 🍹
Trump: "We need law and order." You know Donald, we do need more seasons of Law and Order. You've convinced me. #DebateNight
Are these the same Generals that Trump said were too incompetent to do there job? #debatenight
Oh, shit, is that true? He tried to keep out black people? #debatenight
You guys remember when #DEEZNUTS was running? Those were the good days #debates2016
I think my strongest attribute. Maybe by far. Is my temperament. #debatenight
Clinton: "Let's talk about the question you asked, Lester." Yes, please. How about we actually answer the questions? #debatenight
It's 2016. Twitter doesn't have an edit button and presidential debates don't have a microphone kill button. #debatenight
This is complete destruction. If she wasn't so evil I would feel sorry for her. #debatenight
#debatenight  trump: "I also have a much better temperment than she does." Then he tells the moderator to wait so he can finish.
#debatenight imagine that she actually takes this seriously trump!! Yes she prepared. It's a job!!
All this talk about fat hackers is making me hungry.  #Debates2016 #debates
"They should be paying what they owe" speaking about nato @realDonaldTrump "i pay nothing in taxes because im smart" #debatenight

njdotcom: Clinton to Trump: If your main claim to be president is your business, then we should talk about that. #debatenight
njdotcom: Clinton: Trump has a long history of engaging in racist behavior. The birther lie was a painful one. #debatenight #debate
Another #factcheck that I don't have to google: Hillary@started the birther movement, I remember it and will never forget it #debatenight
I honestly think that I have a better understanding of ISIS than Donald Trump, and could explain it more eloquently -_- #debatenight
Did @realDonaldTrump just drop an advertisement for his new hotel into the #debatenight advertising on candidates clothes for debate 2
Trump used the term "financial disclosure" in the same breath as the bullshit he's spewing about his taxes  #debatenight
#debates This madman can't even debate without losing his cool! Hillary's a cool cat under pressure!
Macroeconomics 101 Mr. Trump: there is more to cutting taxes for business to sustain an economy #pnpcbc #debates
Race relations in the US, aren't worse under @BarackObama, they have actually come into the forefront of people's feeds #debatenight
Why did trump take 9/11 money for his businesses and then increase rents? #debatenight
.@Wikileaks shows the State Department sold 20% of uranium to russia. Hillary's state dept. If we wanna talk about nukes. #debatenight
I think we should all get up &amp; do the wave whenever Trump says, "Wrong." Wave starts on the west coast! GO!!! #debatenight #debates
Well we know that trump doesn't pay taxes and that he was happy about the recession. #debatenight
Hillary is setting herself up to get blasted on Benghazi. With this Trump ignoring or leaving them. #debatenight
I expected to watch Clinton beat Trump but I also get to watch Trump beat Lester Holt  apparently #debatenight
Trump used the biggest word of his life: braggadocious! Sadly, I'm impressed #debatenight #debates
Trump trying to dodge the birtherism question b/c denying it will alienate his deplorables. #debatenight
Trump making fun of a 400lb computer geek. He just lost the Reddit vote. #debatenight
The fact that these are the options is what's most amusing. #debatenight
Yes @HillaryClinton you are right, race determines too much in this country... like school districts. #pro-choice #debatenight
Hillary is being dragged into the weeds, and she doesn't know how to react. #DebateNight #Debates2016
The more he talks in circles about this, the happier she is. Suppressing a lot of smiles there. #debatenight
Trump says "she's going to take guns away from police. He's going to take guns away from gangs." #DebateNight
"When they go low, we go high." These people are all better than I am. #debatenight
What's up with all the water drinking and sniffling is he on coke?#debatenight
Business, invesments, property, all about me, me, me and more me... Trump's argument this whole #debatenight How did this fool get here?
Almost 4,000 people have been killed in Chicago since Obama took office.  #RedTapeHillary #debatenight
Start of the debate: "This should be fun." End of the debate: "Sweet Jesus.." #debatenight
The way Trump speaks in stream of conscious run on sentences has ruined ‘Catcher and the Rye’ for me. #debatenight
An average 32,000 Americans die a year from gun violence. Hillary Clinton is right - we need a change. #debatenight
Trump is just taking obvious pot shots. Obviously Clinton prepared for everything you have to throw at her. #debatenight #TXWatching2016
I keep yelling "how" at my television but I guess The Donald can't hear me. Ultimately, I'm not surprised. #sigh  #debatenight #ImWithHer
I can't believe I'm watching a criminal in Hillary on a debate stage #debatenight
I am in a big fat ugly #bubble filled with YELLING (oh, right, it's the TV).  #debatenight
#Debates2016 @LesterHoltNBC Please stop letting Trump go over time. But so far you are doing well.
#Debates2016 Why is Trump sniffling? Is he sick? Is he on Coke? Mainstream Media why are you not on the case?
Trump running around in circles the moderator just letting him vent bc he just proven to America he's not qualified to be President #Debates
@Mediaite He's done this a lot while campaigning. COPD? Does he smoke? He's always grasping for air. Some say cocaine??? #debates
"I have much better judgement than she has. There's no question about that. I also have much better temperament than she has." #debatenight
HRC now: Russia and Putin are evil! Dems a few years ago: we must get out of "Cold War mentality"  #DebateWithFFL #DebateNight
@queenoopshi watching stranger things... it's like watching the debates it's IS beyond me how they made it this far in the campaign.
If the only thing you have on Hillary is her emails you lost son give it a rest!!! Nobody care about that ish no more!!!!! #debatenight
Undocumented youth will be watching #DebateNight to see how @realDonaldTrump tries to defend his racist and xenophobic policies #HereToStay
"My lawyers say DON'T DO IT" - @realDonaldTrump's lawyers in regards to literally everything he does. #Debates @LaughsTVShow
Someone please tell me that the DC project Trump just mentioned is using non-union illegal immigrant labor... #debatenight
Cyber security, you should know about that bc of your emails ! #debatenight
And we'll keep guessing at what @HillaryClinton was hiding in those 33,000 emails she deleted and paid to have scrubbed. #debates
I don't think you can go on a multi-minute rant and argument, and then say you have a great temperament. #tempertantrum #Debates2016
Hilary and Trump both coming for each other neck right now 😭 #Debates2016
@nytimes all Hillary is doing is covering her won ass she care 0 about the American people #Debates2016
Notice Hillary didn't say police brutality when talking about race and police issues.  #blacklivesmatter  #debate #debatenight
I had to leave the room - has he thrown his wig at Hillary yet? #debatenight
Trumps small loan was a cool 1 million . That would be 6 million in todays money with inflation. #debates
Is Palm Beach the wealthiest community in America? Let me get on Hillary's fact checker. #debatenight
"@Nyamorabu: So we just go to other countries and take the oil 😭 #debatenight" he is so so so scary...taken the oil smh
#Debates2016 #DebateNight Oh shit! 😳 Hillary brought up Trump being sued for denying housing to African Americans!
Of course homegrown terrorism excludes mass shootings committed by white men #debatenight
Wait is he saying Tara or terror? Why do you hate Scarlett O'Hara's house? #debatenight
Trump: The country is falling apart except for my properties.  My properties are  tremendous, believe me #DebateNight
After Trump says "Braggadocios" my wife says "Wow, Donald Trump knows a word that I don't" #DebateNight
Hahahahaha! #Clinton stays slaying #Trump with her remarks. She's so calm and Trump is just yelling and yelling. #debatenight
It seems like Hillary takes twice as long to communicate her ideas but it really doesn't seem like she has the upper hand. #debatenight
So, Cheeto Jesus doesn't have to answer the questions about his tax returns. The IRS says he can release them. Why hasn't he? #debatenight
"We can't just say 'law &amp; order.' We have to come up with a plan" -@HillaryClinton #debatenight
He's gotten away with not paying federal taxes? How does he think we want a president that isn't contributing to our country? #DebateNight
"I 'TAKE ADVANTAGE' of the laws of the nation" aka 'I HAVE NO MORAL COMPASS' #debatenight
According to @ajplus, here is the interruption count  @realDonaldTrump: 17 @HillaryClinton: 4  #debatenight
.@realdonaldtrump says he'll release his tax returns... how many times has he said he'll release them by now? #debatenight
Clinton makes a mistake if she tries to ridicule Trump. Remain serious and keep punching! #debatenight
@realDonaldTrump tax returns are the least of my concerns Give a real answer @HillaryClinton instead of claiming "mistake" #debatenight
It's been months and no one has shot Donald yet. Kill him!!! Just kill him!!! #DebateNight
Racist Bitch you started it. Super predators. Bring them to heel. #debatenight
#debatenight livestream BEST LINE:  Trump "All talk, no action. Sounds good, never gonna happen." We are in the worst trouble right now
#debatenight livestream Hillary bragging about her 30-40 years of tax returns. She's asking why won't he release his tax returns? Not rich?
#debatenight livestream  - Hillary is OUT of her element here with policing discussion. She's blaming police for everything.
"he should have produced it a long time before"...like your tax returns? #Debates2016
You pig. You stop yelling at this woman whose shoes you aren't good enough to wipe.  #debatenight
Gotta hand it to @LesterHoltNBC . He's doing a great job of keeping a straight face. #LoserDonald #Debates2016 #StrongerTogether
Good news everyone, because @realDonaldTrump has decided President Obama is a citizen we can defeat ISIS #debates2016
Hillary's eye is going wacky. Keeps looking down, not making sustained eye contact, to keep it from really bugging out #debatenight
Democrats "use and abuse" people for votes. Republicans use and abuse laws to stop Americans from voting. #debatenight
@Kennedyireland_  I'm surprised you haven't heard those jokes. I'm making a joke about the debates
Trump is now using this airtime as an ad for his hotel. You're under budget because you're not paying your vendors!!!! #debatenight
The IRS says Trump perfectly free to release his tax returns.  He still refuses #debatenight
"I was the one who got him to produce the birth certificate, and I think I did a good job."Trump still believes this is reality tv. #debates
B-52s are not that old I saw them at a zoo this summer and love shack is still 🔥🔥🔥 #debatenight
ISIS is beating us at our own game because our game is to recruit young ppl to become fighters for an apocalyptic terror group? #debatenight
@HillaryClinton: "We've got to stop the systemic racism in our justice system." #debatenight
Hillary is seriously not the one to preach about Cyber Security! #debatenight #ItWasA"Mistake"
We just may see how extraordinarily healthy @realDonaldTrump's heart is tonight.  #debatenight
@HillaryClinton "But let's talk about the question you asked, Lester" because none of them have been answered by Donny. #Debates2016
Wait.. When presidents are no longer in office, they can play golf all of the time?! So basically the Bush presidency before 9/11 #Debates
Honestly, I think by now most of us are pretty convinced that you just want to get off.  #debatenight
It's really not about what they say. it is about what trump mentioned "actions" &amp; who is really going to make America "great" again #Debates
Gotta love how this has devolved into Donald "mr. NYC" Trump getting a civics lesson on live television. #debates
Trump's defense for racial discrimination is basically "yeah but we got away with it." #Debates2016
I'm 10 shots deep on Trump saying the phrase "not good" alone tonight, guys.... #debatenight
Take guns away from the hood?...How'd they get there in the first place?  #debatenight
I wonder how the Fed feels about being told that they are being more political than Hilary. #debatenight
She deleted emails. Okay, she's a liar. Is that not the definition of a politician? #PresidentialDebate #DebateNight #FactCheck
Trump Used his full 2 minutes to say nothing really serious. #debatenight he's now using the other question to overcome.
It is hard to follow, but I think Trump just accused his 10-year old son of hacking the DNC #debatenight
Hillary don won #debatenight  racism got to go trump was stumbling too much on this topic
"The birther lie was a very hurtful one." Clinton says Obama was hurt by claims that Trump perpetuated #cunyjvote16 #Debates2016
I was excited about #debatenight but I'm pretty sure I'm having a panic attack instead.
So, does Donald Trump ever provide any solutions for all the problems he talks about? #debatenight
#Debates2016 oh boy now Holt is going for the throat. The Bircher issue
Donald Trump is such a hipster. Gotta hate mainstream everything 🙄 #DebateNight
@HillaryClinton will clearly win this debate, but it's a Pyrrhic victory: Voters are the real losers tonight #debates #cbsnreax
How can any thinking person look at this guy &amp; think "Yeah this guy should run this country!" ? #Debates2016 #debates
1. What is "the cyber" 2. Why did Russia or China invent it 3. What is going on #debatenight
Trump's answers kinda sound like he is recalling every talking point but can't quite pull the narrative together #teamrhetoric #debatenight
Wow. Apparently the word "temperament" was a boomerang weapon the whole time. #Debates2016
only truth @realDonaldTrump would say tonight: "our airports are from a third world country" #Debates
Why did they even have an audience if they're not allowed to react? No, seriously. #DebateNight
"We've got to address the systemic racism in our criminal justice system." -@HillaryClinton  THANK YOU. #Debates2016
#debatenight #HillaryClinton  really looks tired...like she's up past her bedtime and doesn't want to be there.
If you get audited almost every year, you might be doing something wrong. #debatenight
But like no new President has ever ignored what his predecessor has done. We probably still withdrew too soon. #Debates
Watching #Trump and #Hillary stumble over "African Americans" because they don't have enough cred to say "black" is awesome   #debatenight
Honestly this debate is more like a messy in class discussion than a presidential debate #debatenight
Obama should have delayed producing his birth certificate until Donald Trump released his taxes #debatenight
#debatenight makes me wish people would return to arguing about the black/blue dress
As former enlisted, I don't necessarily listen to those Admirals/Generals.  But the guys from the think tanks... #debatenight #Debates2016
Trump should apologize for not paying contractors. The entire Government should apologize for wasting citizens money. #Debates2016
So if Trump doesn't like your work he gets to not pay a penny? Wow. He is so awful. I never truly realised it until now. #debatenight
Neither one cares about the country or anything, they both just seem concerned about beating the other. and it's DISGUSTING #Debates2016
This debate is like watching a drunk couple trying not to fight in front of company. #debatenight
This debate is like watching an Adam Sandler movie without the laughs #debatenight #Debates2016
"LaGuardia doesn't have swimming pool on the tarmac. We live in a third world country" #debatenight
How can you watch this and think this man is fit to lead our country? #debatenight
Lester has lost control. Though he had it much longer than I actually expected he would. #debatenight  #debates
The fact they are bitching at each other than talking about the real problems about this country is pathetic #DebateNight
These 2 candidates haven't got a single clue about the idea we call America. Not a clue. Not half a clue. #Debates #Debates2016 #debatenight
I'm waiting for Donald to reply "I WAS SMART!" to Hillary's mention of the lawsuit against him for housing discrimination #Debates2016
"I DON'T HAVE A TEMPERAMENT PROBLEM!!!!" - Donald Trump throwing a temper tantrum. #debates #debates2016
Donald Trump rambling like DMX when he's coked up. I'm just waiting on Donald to say "what these bitches want from a nigga" #Debates2016
@GovGaryJohnson Shame you are not there to actually bring some integrity to these debates
Aside from the debates: I was talking to my brother about memes and my mom just looked very confused. So precious
#debates Clinton bringing it back on topic after Trump trying to control it
The answer to ending gun violence is not employing more police you bozo 👊🏾 #dumpTrump #debatenight
Is talking about bull crap things like the birther issue considered halftime in this debate? #debatenight #Debates2016
@_darreenn_11 They're both liars, so at least vote for the educated one. #debatenight #debates #Debates2016
Someone tell Donald's hair stylist that the blow dryer should've been pointed in the other direction, he looks ridiculous! #debatenight
Cops should have degree's in psychology all of them and paid accoringly #debates
.@HillaryClinton admits (in a lot of words) that police have implicit racial bias! #debatenight
Palm Beach is rough? Get the fuck out of here 😒😒😒 #debates
Did he just say our country was a mess because our airports aren't pretty? 🤔 #debatenight
Damn it... I missed the debate. Got some catching up to do. 🤓 #Debates2016
"not everyone respects the law"... kind of sounds like Hillary is blaming. #debatenight
I'm only watching because I heard a rumour in the forums that Hillarys supposed to reveal the Nintendo NX #debatenight #nintendo #nintendonx
I cringe at the word "African American". America still denies the slave descendants identity being Israelites #Debates2016
He talking about her soundbites or his ? Asking for a friend..#debatenight
Oh by the way......  Trickle-down economics was an overall success during the Reagan era. #debatenight
Donald: "I have property there." Hillary: "Check the fact checker on that." #debatenight
Oh DAMN! She dropped " Trumped Up Trickle Down " into the debate a 2nd time. #debatenight
@Jonny_Wags seriously, it took so fucking long, and I bet the only reason he admitted it is that it was politically expedient #debates
#debates  #ClintonTrumpDebate  #Trump is making sense for once?   Dob you agree?
#Debates Stop and frisk... Omg... Law and order... Turn his mic off...
Hillary will you make the changes that you speak of...that started during the Clinton administration..like racial profiling  #debatenight
Can someone locate Lester Holt's voice and bring it to the debate stage? Thanks #debatenight
If our citizens cared this much about senate and congressional elections, there'd be a lot less shit to worry about #debatenight
#debatenight Blowing other nations soldiers out of the water??? What a temperament!
We spent $6 billion...because of a Republican-led folly in the Middle East that has const us dearly. You forgot that, Donny. #Debates2016
He really is going to try and blame her for everything. What her husband did, what Obama did, what businesses did... Like... #debates
She's practically begging for Politifact to rush the stage and hold up a flaming pair of pants. #debatenight
I don't have TV or a proper velocity web connection, so I'm not watching #debatenight other than thru Ur eyes.👓
STOP AND FRISK IS BULLSHIT 2K16 STOP CALLING POC BAD PEOPLE 2K16  #debatenight
Really though. Mics should only be live for the allotted time. You don't even need tech, have #Harambe in a booth with switches. #debates
Yes I'm sure racial profiling is the best way to stop crime #sarcasm #debatenight
"I've been given great credit for what I did", giving yourself a thumbs up is not a good indicator. #Debates
Dump Trump shut up! Let her speak. He is such a child #debates
Am I watching the debate or a Saturday night live skit ? #Debates2016
So Trump thinks if you reduce taxes to corporations, it creates jobs. Hilarious!! #debatenight
"I am the one who got him to produce it". Trump doubling down on his own racist rhetoric. Can't make this up. #debatenight
“No one wants to call Sean Hannity”  First thing he’s said that I believe.   #Debates2016
Hillary says “I’ve got a great tech guy to delete the problem 😉” #Debates2016
Did trump just say not paying federal income taxes makes him a smart man? #debates
Did Trump just tell a story of how he opened an "integrated" club? WOW. Is this 2016 or 1916? #debatenight #Debates2016
Fuck it ... I can't keep up with tweeting about #Trump 's lies during this #debatenight
#Debates Clearly Trump isn't going to give real answers and is just using this to brag about himself. Might as well watch youtube
I need a pee break, Lester. Or I could just pee out of my nose and sniff it back in all presidential and shit. #DebateNight
@realDonaldTrump says, "If I don't get to Pennsylvania one way, I'll get there another" VERY Presidential. #debates2016 #debatenight
"ISIS formed in a vacuum created by Hillary Clinton and Barrack Obama" #Debates2016
@HillaryClinton did you know that Donald has a good temperament? I didn't. #debatenight
Sorry for typos people. My fingers can't keep up with Hillary's corrupt mind a, spin, and lies. #Debates2016 #MAGA
Get guns out of law abiding citizens hands? The "bad guys" will still get the guns! @HilaryClinton  #MakeAmericaGreatAgain #Debates
Hillary, you just keep digging a bigger hole for yourself. I'm going to need you to shut up now #debatenight
Put ya set up... RT @angela_rye: I need Lester to be like: "Hold up, my dude. CUT me off one more time and see what happens." #Debates2016
Wait, but did @realDonaldTrump even finish one sentence? I can't follow him. Feeling bad for the transcribers tonight #debatenight
#debatenight Just Remember Disease and Addictions knows no Race Color or ceed (it's no joke)
#debatenight Trump just lost the votes of all Americans over 400 lbs
Remember that time you had hope we could get a president that is not a complete ass clown? yeah...me neither #debatenight #2016election
It took 30 minutes for the first mention of Hillary's emails. New record! #debatenight
The country doesn't work as is and the businessman isn't smart enough in this forum. It's lose/lose #debatenight
I wonder when his audit will be finished. My guess is just in time for new years. #debatenight
I'm not African-American, nor do I have any ties with them, but allow me to speak for them fully. #debatenight
Why did Obama have to give up his birth certificate? If he was a white man they wouldn't blink an eye.  #Debates
Trump: Hillary's been fighting ISIS her entire adult life &amp; ISIS was formed when we invaded Iraq. So, Hillary is 31 years old. #debates
@GovGaryJohnson I think you're winning the debate by not being there.  #debates
Aka "I got out of the lawsuit by not even admitting to them how racist I was even though they knew it" - Trump #debatenight
Makeup:  Trump wins most improved. Hillary wins best highlight.  #debatenight
Trump: Democrats make campaign promises to win black votes. I won't even do that!  #debatenight
Trump gone be pissed when he hears what PAYS for our infrastructure. Talkin bout cuttin taxes AND building roads, shit.   #debates
I wish Jim Ross was calling this match "MY GOD SHE'S LITERALLY TEARING HIM IN HALF!!!"  #WWE #RAW #debatenight
If you included the word "Tremendous" in your drinking game, my condolences to your liver. #Debates2016
Snap! @HillaryClinton "I think you criticized me for preparing for the debate and I did. I also have prepared to be president" #DebateNight
#debates Trump giving version 5 of this answer with some additional ad for his hotel. Heat is off Clinton. Now Trump is talking about roads?
"That makes me smart" to offload your tax debt onto the middle class and pay no taxes?? #Trump #debatenight
Donald Trump's sniff will be the political equivalent of Al Gore's sigh. #debatenight
Just because you have businesses in Charlotte does not a non-racist make. @realDonaldTrump #debatenight #Debates2016
Russia, China, the obese - Bernie - another country? Thanks, Obama #debatenight #weinventedtheinternet
I've been endorsed by ICE. Also, ketchup, mustard, napkins, Russia, very bad. We came up with the internet. #debatenight
"We don't have people that know what they're doing." Says a reality TV star running for the top office in America #DebateNight
Everybody tweeting about the #DebateNight like they didn't see this coming. My dog could debate better than these 2
Tried listening to the debates tonight and quit after 5 minutes. Asinine comments from both candidates. Good luck America #debatenight
When all the Hillary supporters have nothing to comeback with other than to laugh at his "temperament" #winning #trump #debatenight
Is ANYONE looking these people up or calling them? OBVIOUSLY THEY HAVE ALL THE ANSWERS WE NEED TO KNOW ON @realDonaldTrump #debatenight
@LesterHoltNBC #Debates2016 For 4 solid minutes tween Donna Trump whines about no one wanting to call her friend Shawna on the phone
It's depressing that only 2 minutes of this debate so far has been about improving the lives of general public #debatenight
#debatenight just thinking about how much of a mess this election is actually going to be, Justin Trudeau we need you
So we need to be paid to protect our allies?  Doesn't this make us mercenaries? #debatenight
What about taking $ from the Foundation for legal expenses for his businesses?  #Debates
@TheRiverWanders @Chloebeetle trumps speech it's the rambling of someone suffering from final stage alzheimer's. #debatenight
#Trump: no one's work is ever good enough and therefore doesn't pay. How he makes his money. #Debates2016   #debates   #debatenight
#Hillary nailing #Donald on tax returns, Not as rich as he says. Not as charitable as he says. In debt to Wall Street smh #Debates2016
@Luvvie @marionleary Trump's lost you so hard, I don't think he could get you back without dying and reincarnating first. #debates
The other moderators lined up for the next two debates: I QUIT
Cause rich people arent paying enough got damn taxes lmfao #debatenight tf
Donald when is the last time you flew commercial? America looks like a third world country? Really? #Debates2016
@DamnitDaniellee I'm just waiting for Hillary to go over &amp; bite Donald in the arm. (It's always the girls) (I was that girl) #debatenight
"The gun epidemic is the leading cause of death of young African American men." YES. #debatenight
#DonTheCon using #Debate2016 for free TV advertising of his properties. #Debatenight is not the place. #ImWithHer
"I'll release my tax returns as soon as the audit is over. That will be Nov. 9." @realDonaldTrump  Idiot. #debatenight
all of these #debates memes are my only solace in the midst of this shit show
"The cyber" may be my favorite thing since "sport". I am an expert at The Cyber. #debatenight
Hillary is moving into the realm of indignant now...glad my father never worked for you...haaaaaaa! #hillary #debatenight
I am so thrilled to see all of my friends tweeting/snapping about #debatenight ! Get mad educated ✌🏻️
Have Latinos been seriously discussed at all in just about an hour? #debatenight
Her response to his "law &amp; order" isn't really anything different. What's the ACTUAL plan? What are the ways we can work on it? #Debates2016
All year, Hillary has been wearing red and Trump has been wearing blue. What's the deal? #debatenight
Trump: "you called black kids super predators. That was horrible. I just want to stop black kids and have police feel their junk" #debates
entire campaign has been discriminatory towards minorities. U pander to us like u know us but u wouldn't even give us shelter #debatenight
@sortius Trump presidential drinking game. Drink until you pass out, wake up, drink again, keep drinking until it's over #debatenight
"Black people love me,So many black people love me it's a fact they even let me say the n word that's a fact"-@realDonaldTrump #debates
Even my 6-year old daughter can see that Hillary Clinton will make a waaaay better President than this joker called Trump #Debates2016
is it just me or does @realDonaldTrump 's suit look cheapas fok....like something out of Sears catalog #debates
Hillary is such a liar, no matter how convincing her arguments are, you CANNOT believe her. #Debates
What the hell is this cat talking about? It's like watching a child argue with an adult #debatenight
Hillary's debate prep: Be polite, dont make ppl think you're a rude, angry woman. Jesus.  #debatenight
OMG HE'S A MANIAC!! How is he getting even 1 vote? #Debates2016  #ImWithHer
Trump "I'm very very proud. That is how I feel. That is the true way I feel"  The DUH heard round the world, ladies and gentlemen. #debates
Trump "The single greatest problem we have is nuclear weapons.  Which is why I recommended nuking the middle east"  #debates
Not sure if he's talking about "terror" or the Latin name for Earth (Terra); lso think he's talking about religious moose. #debatenight
🍊: I have a winning temperament. That tanning bed has made you delirious. #Debates2016
The #debates is like watching two twelve year-olds trying to explain their side to the teacher.
"Everyone should be respected by the law an respect the law"  PREACH 🙌🏻 #debatenight
Hillary answering on cyber security . . . this should be good. 😒 #debates
In 2016, the most experienced person in US politics is being mansplained to on National TV. And people are eating it up. WUT. #debates
Somebody should've given a high five to Hillary on that one #debatenight
Hillary is dangerously close to shooting her entire wad. She's going to have nothing to go after Trump on in the next two debates.
Brilliant response from @HillaryClinton on Trump's failure to pay federal taxes &amp; connection to underfunded infrastructure. #debatenight
Lester you can interrupt him when he's trying to convince us he's got a "winning temperament" for 30 secs #PresidentialDebate #Debates2016
When he said illegal immigrants are in gangs is he talking about Irish or Italian gangs. I'll wait. #Debates2016
I trust the Designated Survivor with the nuclear codes better than @realDonaldTrump !!!!  #debatenight  #debate2016
Number of interruptions: 1 million Number of secs it took for Lester to lose control: 1.2 Watching this train wreck?: Priceless #debatenight
Trump's response to cyber security is basically - "I don't have a clue." #debatenight
Literally mouth agape - "That makes me smart" - to not pay federal taxes. But he's the "working man's" candidate? #thinkagain #Debates2016
Donald Trump thinks he should get credit for opening a business that doesn't discriminate against some people. #lowbar  #debatenight
Exactly what international law does he think would allow US to invade a country and steal their assets? #Debates2016
I've never even heard a gun shot before outside of a gun range. #Debates2016
If he didn't break any laws, who cares about his return? If he gamed the system, fix it. #debatenight
Trump, "I respect African Americans."   Continues to talk over and disrespect Lester Holt #debates
Fact check Lester stop &amp; frisk was ruled unconstitutional .  No you r wrong#trump #debatenight
How about a commercial so I can get a snack?  #Debates2016

FOR THE LOVE OF GOD, PLEASE CALL SEAN HANNITY! He's obviously lonely.  #Debates2016 #debates
"Law and Order. If we don't have it, what will we watch on USA?" #Debates2016
Trump said it: Hillary mentioned super predator back in the day. Coming from a guy who wanted death for the #centralpark5... #debatenight
#NATO is a hammer in search of a screw. But I don't expect Trump to understand that... #debatenight
Trump is all about doing bussines but hes totally a pighead in any other topic! #debatenight
"I think it's disgraceful, and believe me..." I know a lot about disgraceful. #debatenight
Did Trump really fight with Hannity over Iraq in 2002? Really? #debatenight
@MichaelBerrySho what happen to the decorum of the Presidential debates in the audience.
This segment is the reason why HRC isn't finding headway among black millennials. we aren't the church or the black family. #debatenight
Trump believes he can prevent others taking advantage of Americans because he exploited us first and knows how's it's down #TrumpU #Debates
#Debates2016  Hope everyone knows these 2 clowns make r country a laughing stock. Really sad... Voting for @GovGaryJohnson
It doesn't matter if Trump supported the war. He was a businessman not a politician. #DebateNight
Moderator: What do you say to people of color who- Trump: I say nothing.   #debatenight

#Trump: We have to knock the hell out of ISIS. Gee, I was sorta hoping we'd knock ISIS into hell. #debates #debatenight
Hm trump the grump misunderstood the question he thought the question was "how do we INCREASE the racial divide?"#debatenight #Debates2016
Did anyone else just hear Trump ask Lester if the Dirty Birds were beating Who Dat Nation? #MNF #debatenight
I wish debates were like hockey games so we could just yell bullshit at every bad call #debatenight
Comparisons to Hitler aren't fair. Trump is more like your drunk uncle who rants a little too long at dinner #debatenight
dude this reminds me of those "debates" u had to do in social studies class in like 5th grade
"It's all words" "I'm taking advantage of the laws of this nation" - did he just say that? #DebateNight
You want a dude that gets audited every year to lead this country? Lmao. #Trump #debatenight
For @realDonaldTrump to say that America is a third world country shows how oblivious and overly privileged he is #debatenight
He's free to release his tax returns, and just talked in circles around the question. Said nothing. ® #debatenight
No one questions how Hillary is suddenly pro gay marriage after being against it for years. #debatenight
Uh huh. But why were you still on it in 2014? #debatenight
Stop and risk was a big failure Trump! Stricter law and order equals a police state. I need a drink! Here I come whisky! #debatenight
Clinton's speculating too much about Trump's tax returns. It's a smart move, but not an honest one. #debates2016
The Donald still did not give one fucking answer !! he dodged every question !!!! #debatenight he pointing fingers but no answer
On the bright side, he hasn't said anything about his dick yet... #debatenight
@realDonaldTrump here is your chance to tell America your platform.  We already know you don't like @HillaryClinton #debatenight
Hillary brings up Trump's past racism knowing she campaigned/worked for a man who wanted to re-segregate the US in the '60s  #debatenight
Did Trump just reference a 400 lb. person sitting on a bed during this debate? #Debates2016
Donald Trump literally has no presidential/political experience what so ever and he wants to be president? #debatenight
#Hilary Secretary Clinton The Donald Donald Trump She's so in love with Pres. Obama now, she treated him like a sh** in 2008. #debatenight
"I am prepared to b president. And I think that's a good thing." HC #debatenight #debate2016
BEING AUDITED DOES NOT MEAN YOU CAN'T RELEASE YOUR TAX RETURNS YOU DISINGENUOUS LIAR #Debates2016
Gang violence is a problem, but that doesn't make police brutality any less of one #Debates2016
Tell us how safe USA is after moderator read that list of terror attacks, Hillary #debatenight
Donald Trump just barfed up a word salad all over the debate stage. Not exactly presidential. #debatenight
@HillaryClinton "when they go low, we go high" ummmmm honey, I do believe your world is upside down if you think you're going high #debates
@TheRock trump is a real person talking like a real person #notgood  Hillary sounding like a politician working for votes #notgood #debates
#debatenight @7layers_ bro trump is talkin about our internet skills. Says we're good.
Everyone talking about the #Debates and I'm here just looking for a shiny Shroomish
Did Donald trump just say its smart to not pay fed taxes? Lol #debatenight
Trump literally didn't deny that he was a birther. That might be the most damning thing that has happened in this debate. #debatenight
Not even watching #debatenight bc they're not even talking about real issues. It's a couple of 3rd graders arguing over attention.
Trump Lost. Clinton Won. thanks to @CNN and @twitter for the show tonight. I was going to watch #KUWTK tonight. #debatenight
I'm surprised he didn't say he was better than Clinton because she was a woman.. #debatenight
Big companies are made on the back of poor people like me. Yet I can't feed my family but the wealthy eats abundantly #debatenight
I'm not gonna get credit for this..but Trump is an idiot #debatenight
A man who stands up for himself like Trump will stand up for America! #debatenight #Debates2016
Love when he says no one questions that...but was just asked a question about it. What an idiot. #debatenight
Police outgunned?  But our police are becoming military against the citizens #Debates2016
Clinton also met a lot of women who were stiffed by her husband.  #Debates2016 #Deplorable
"I have a much better temperament". Really Trump? Just answer the questions #debatenight
I love living in a society where women show the same level of aggression as men and then get attacked for it #debatenight
Trump on relations with the African American community: "I think for the last little while I have made an effort" #2little2late #Debates2016
Since Trump supporters are constantly commenting on HRCs appearance &amp; health, I'll say..he looks like shit. Pallid &amp; sickly. #debatenight
#Debates2016 how will nato support us against Isis if we don't support them in Europe.
HOW ARE YOU GOING TO GET TOUGH ON THESE CYBER ATTACKS!?! HOOOOOOOWWWW??? He gives NOTHING!! #Debates2016 #debates
Ermm can someone tell Mr. Trump the topic was , "race" and "racial profiling" by police ? #debates #debatenight #pnpcbc
Trump: "The security element of cyber is very, very tough." "Maybe not doable." ??? #Debates
Hey @FCC there's a man talking out of his ass on live tv. #debatenight
Because Sean Hannerty and Fox supporting you shows you have better judgement and temperament.  #PotMeetKettle #debatenight #TrumpIsAnIdiot
Lester should ask about the war in Syria, about Putin being mad at the USA, about our troops dying  #debatenight
Change the subject, Trump.  You're fixing to get owned.  Change it, bruh.    #Debates2016
Hillary wants to take Isis out of Iraq and "squeeze them into Syria" ??? #debates
This is so scary: "My number one asset is my temperament"you're a tax+draft+responsibility dodging narcissist w/criminal record #Debates2016
I've been all over the place and you decided to stay home lmao #DebateNight
Oh shit she is burning him on the taxes because she can speculate wildly since he opened the door. #debatenight
Is there a gif with that noise Trump just made? Get on it. #debatenight
He just said you learned nothing from tax filings! Now he's doing the golf club dick measuring about how his $$ is leveraged #Debates2016
FACT: DNC hacks actually show NO action taken against @BernieSanders, just that lifelong Dems privately supported a lifelong Dem. #debates
Lester: Asks a question about policy. Trump: 2 minutes of rambles about how awesome he is. #debatenight
Once again, he doesn't answer the question, he just brags that he got the birth certificate. And they let him. #Debates2016
So we all agree, murder is bad. Glad we settled that in this debate. #debates @realDonaldTrump
I wonder if he could stop complaining and start explaining HOW he would do all of this? #debatenight
Trump just suggest that his 10 yo son could actually do the hacks america was attacked with. Is this a confession or a brag? #debatenight
We've reached the point where Clinton is really confident that she is winning #debatenight
Where is Hillary's American Flag pin? Trump has his on his vest. Maybe that's because Hillary's NOT for America! #Debates2016
Congratulations, Palm Beach. You are now the richest people in the world? #debatenight
I wish I had started counting how many times Donald has said "things" during the debate from the outset.  #specifics #knowledge.  #Debates
Time to change the channel. Now it's the same spin of pure drivel #Debates2016 #I'dratherhavearootcanalthankeepwatching
I agree with one thing the @realDonaldTrump has to say: nobody calls @seanhannity  #debatenight
A very against police judge. Apparently a very for the constitution judge though... #debates
#Debates2016 #DebateNight Hillary has been lying this whole debate, she knows it! Even the moderator knows yet he's doing nothing about it!
@realDonaldTrump says his federal income tax would be squandered should he pay any... is he confirming his evasion? #SyrRelPol #debates
"We should have taken their oil." How does she let that slide? #DebateNight
"A very against police judge" 😂 Trump is so absurd. He's also advocating an unconstitutional policy #stopandfrisk #debatenight
Did this man just dog whistle "women are emotionally out of control" .... #debatenight
Does Donald know that you can't occupy the presidency ahead of schedule? #debatenight
ya im still shook that u dissed our airports. I freakin love airports 😕 #debatenight #Debates2016 #airports2016
but like, wasn't the topic race?!?! Don't we need to address THE TOPIC?? tf is this about your club in palm Beach #debates2016
Donald, you're in your own reality again ... #stopandfrisk IS another form of #racialprofiling. #Debates2016
#debatenight Welcome to Canada we have really good candy,maple syrup and poutine

There are some "bad people" who wear badges and hold guns. Can you take guns from them Trump?#debatenight
#debatenight my husband thinks DT talks like an 8th grader- 8th graders deserve more credit- they're more well-spoken
Um, I'm way more concerned about global warming than nuclear wars.  #debatenight
Remember, your voting history is recorded. We will know that you voted for Trump. Foreverrrrrrr #debatenight
How many fucking times do you need to mention your tremendous companies ?? Answer one question coherently...I'll wait  #debatenight
This "mediator" is getting absolute dominated by Trump. Grow some balls and keep this "debate" on course #DebateNight
"I've prepared for this debate, and I prepared to be president." - H #debates
"The record shows that I'm right!" - Trump. Of course it does. #debates
"I have much better judgment than she has, and a much better temperament." - Trump ............ #debates2016 No. Sir.
I give Hillary a ton of credit. I would have went off on this man a 55 minutes ago with his pompous disrespect. #Debates2016
Did he really say "You and your .... President think"?  #debatenight
Donald's wearing a flag pin, Hillary not... these things jump out. #debatenight
Tell us specifically. TELL US SPECIFICALLY. SPECIFICALLY. -Lester Holt pleading with Trump #debatenight
Donny, grab a 🍭 and calm down a little. I know you've never had to actually listen to a woman, but it'll be okay. I promise. #DebateNight
Trump is talking out of his ass. And Lester is allowing him to. #Debates2016
@realDonaldTrump is flyyyyyyyyinnnnnnnngggg! Yo he has to be off that A1 perico. #debatenight
Obama's birth certificate was important to the Tea Bagger party. You don't get to wash your hands of your involvement. #debatenight
"NO, YOU'RE WRONG IT WENT A JUDGE A VERY AGAINST  THE POLICE JUDGE" #DebateNight
Donald, just b/c you say someone's wrong, doesn't make it so. Your personal reality isn't shared by ANYONE else. #MomsAgainstTrump #debates
Trump is absolutely embarrassing himself and all of his supporters, Clinton crushed him on his idea that the rich need big tax cuts #Debates
#debatenight What the hell is being overweight or obese have to do with cyber security.  Donny the #idiot
Look how calm Hillary Clinton is. Poised. Quick-witted. Trump is agitated. Impatient. #DebateNight
How many fucking times must Hillary Clinton apologize for the stupid emails? #debatenight #bcmediachat
Don't get me wrong. Trump, as far as a business man, is a smart guy. Mouth wise.. ehhhh. Who's gonna win? #debatenight
1. You don't need to be audit free to release tax returns. 2. I don't think Donald knows how to file a tax return. #debatenight
I've participated in MUN debates that are more legitimate than this
Is @realDonaldTrump forgetting that it was the Bushes that got us into Iraq? #debatenight
I wish they had the videos qued up of @realDonaldTrump saying everything he keeps denying  #debatenight
If trump is able to get companies to come back,,,, how come he was not able to create a plan to save the casinos??#debatenight
Following @billmaher during the #debatenight. Way more entertaining than the debate. I can see him yelling at the tv, losing his sh@t!
I assume everyone watching #debatenight hears DUN DUN when Donald say law and order
Does Hillary seriously think these criminals with guns acquire them legally? #Debate #Debates2016 #debatenight
Trickle Down doesn't work... Top down is only a great approach is you live on the top.  #debatenight
YES THANK YOU. She is calling out internal, ingrained bias. THANK. YOU. WE have a racial problem. #Debates2016
"I have a much better temperament than she does," he says as he interrupts everyone. #Debates2016
Sounds like when Trump clears his theist he is saying "Wrong!" Oh wait. #Debates2016
THIS MAN IS SERIOUSLY RUNNING WTF!?!?! This cannot be allowed to happen to our nation. #debatenight #ImWithHer
Oh yes Trump build up our economy by refinancing our national debt. That will REALLY help Americas economic outlook. #sarcasm #debatenight
"When I look at Charlotte, a city I love, a city where I have investments..." #whosaidit #Debates2016
But has Bobby Newport ever had a real job in his life? #debates
Big moment here.  Trump brought up Super Predator line.  Hillary has to respond well here.   #debatenight
Trump is clearly low class to project this question away from himself but I think it might work.   #debatenight
"Black. I feel like you heard me say black but what I really want to say is BBBUULLAAACCKK." #debatenight
I give up. I tried, but I'm literally getting dumber watching this. #DebateNight
So y'all gon talk about 'Merca at all or just about yourselves the whole damn time? #DebateNight
"Implicit bias"—ugh! What a counterproductive argument—such an undue shift in burden of proof. #debatenight #Debates2016
Wait so is his 10 year old son going to be head of cyber security in his goodly bigly regime? #debates
America needs more Law &amp; Order. We always need more episodes of SVU, Trump. #debatenight
Real friends put their phones under the tv so you can hear #DebateNight. Thanks @aubvi. You the real hero.
Wow, thank god @realDonaldTrump spent 5 years trying to find @BarackObama'a birth certificate when he already had produced it... #debates
"Toby, Come quick! Donald's getting his ass kicked by a girl."  "Ginger get the popcorn." @WestWingWeekly @JoshMalina @HrishiHirway #debates
YOU SUPPORTED THE IRAQ WAR DONALD! YOU SAID IT ON HOWARD STERN. YOU DID!!! #ImWithHer #Debates
Wrong side of the email argument. She left that door wide open. #Debates2016
Trump doesn't seem to understand the meaning of the word "deleted" — how can she release emails that were deleted? #Debates
FACT CHECK. Law and Order was renewed for another season. Great show. #debatenight
I love that she's calling him "Donald". It subtly undermines his authority every time she says it. #debatenight
Another reality check: the $ in cash was unfreezing Iranian assets. It was not some sort of ransom payment. #gotohell #Debates2016
He's so god damn annoying and he sniffing is doing my head in #debatenight sounds like a child next to someone with thought through ideas
Funny but like his book insulting people with his faults, Trump is describing what this country will become #thirdworld #debatenight
@realDonaldTrump You agreed that you can't get into white house, so working on Plan B. #debatenight
Clinton keeps bringing up her father in hopes that Trump shits on him. #debatenight
#Debates  Why did Hillary Clinton delete the emails....to hide what she did from we the people. Totally untrustworthy
Hey @LesterHoltNBC, now would be a good time to use your position to actually moderate by allowing each candidate to speak! #Debates2016
Oh he did not just say African Americans and Hispanics are living in hell. Oh no he didn't. Apparently my SoCal is hell.  #debatenight
#Hillary just accused #Trump of not paying any #incometaxes for years! No need for facts. #liar #debatenight
Don't talk about how *amazing* you are, Trump. We know how *amazing* you are. #debatenight
Lester Holt: DOMESTIC TERRORISM. Trump: BUT I ONLY KNOW HOW TO TALK ABOUT ISIS. #debatenight
Trump also said that the NFL was against the dates of these debates. The NFL said he's a liar. On the record. #Debates2016
Goodness trump loves to backtrack on everything. Flip flopping really hard  #Debates
No no no. Just show us your taxes. I want to see them. Let me decide whether you've cheated your country @realDonaldTrump . #Debates2016
between Hilary and Donald, I don't know which one is worse than the other #debatenight
if you missed the #debates, it was pretty much what you'd guess.
trump is on fire. Like a trash can is on fire. If hillary sits back, ol man trump will take himself out #debatenight
#debatenight Good gawd. It feels like I'm watching grandparents on Divorce Court
"In a lot of places, our police are outgunned" -Clinton on escalations of gun violence #debatenight
I'm watching this for extra credit but wow I don't know what's HAPPENIG because trump ISNJUST saying the dumbest shit?? #debatenight
#debates Republicans *always* want to cut taxes, and democrats *always* want to raise taxes; I don't get why they're on this
Great. We have descended into emails and tax returns. The stuff that is really going affect the lives of Americans. #debates #Debates2016
Guns aren't the problem. The drug war is what causes people to pick up guns in the first place. Take the money out of drugs. #debates
i am glad i can use the internet to see this live i will definitely watch the other debates yet to come   #debatenight
I feel like I don't trust Hillary or Trump with anything. Really need to pick the lesser of two evils... #debates
"i have a winning temperament" *hillary literally lols on the split screen* #debatenight
He himself don't know wht he is taking about, just irrationally opposing the policies of Clinton  #debates
$14 million isn't alot of money. Now $650 million isn't alot of money. But he is going to know how to help average people? Ok. #debatenight
It's really hard to sit here and listen to Hillary's voice for this long. Can't imagine 4 years of that. #debatenight
This man is so out of touch...with the common person and with reality. #DebateNight
It is really beyond me why people would want this guy as their president.  #Debates2016
Donald Trump cannot become our next President. He's unstable, erratic and not versed in country, economic affairs. #debatenight #ImWithHer
Hillary Clinton is way too advanced, experienced and smart to debate with this fool. Shame in the GOP -- we can do better. #debatenight
HRC: Abolish ALL private prisons. There should not be a profit motive for prisons. YES!! #debatenight #debates
Still waiting for the question on the "biggest threat to our country" : climate change.  #Debates2016 #debatenight
It's so funny when Trump loses an argument he clicks his tongue and rolls his eyes. He's such a sore loser. #debatenight
Coming up after the break: #HillaryClinton performs the #JuJuOnThatBeat dance to win the "youth" group. #debatenight #debates
If I were @LesterHoltNBC, I'd be getting so wasted tonight after this shit show. #debatenight
YOU STARTED THE BIRTH CERTIFICATE BULLSHIT GET THEE HENCE BEHIND ME  #debatenight
The guy who doesn't pay taxes or anybody for anything is telling countries they don't pay NATO anything/enough for protection #Debates2016

honestly i feel so betrayed. my west wing loving soul feel betrayed by the american people responsible for this. THIS. #debatenight
Are they going to keep letting Trump talk over Hillary during her segment? Is he going to give any clear plans? #debatenight
Did #Trump just say he came up with the internet? Isn't that what ended Gore's campaign? #Debates2016
@JoyPullmann @realJohnGibbs @ProFamilyIL Why should he? Whites kill whites too. So should that be discussed too? #debatenight
Mansplainers of Twitter are mansplaining why Trump isn't mansplaining.   Good job, real great work 👏👏👏 #debatenight
"I have a better temperament than she does"  Best lie of the night!!!!!!!!! #Debates2016
Are we ever going to hear about policy or just emails and taxes? #debatenight
It's near the end and Trump is unravelling and behaving like we knew he would. #debatenight
Hills threw the father Bomb. SHIT IS REAL. Brought up bankruptcy. AWWWW YEAH. #Debates2016
If I was Hilary I would have smacked Trump across the head by now #DebateNight
@realDonaldTrump is completely incapable of staying on topic. He can't handle it. It's embarrassing that he's gotten this far. #debatenight
This is literally the worst thing i have ever seen.  I believe this is what Jackson Pollock felt like when he painted.  #debatenight
Trump: "I have a much better temperament than she does" People, including myself, laughed out loud. #DebateNight
Trump's plan for cyber security: Some retired generals like me  #debatenight
Trump says will release tax return when clinton releases her emails... clinton says he can release the returns #Debates2016
I opened a club in Palm Beach, hotel in DC, and ... It's product plug night  #Debates2016
If I took a shot each time @realDonaldTrump said "believe me" I would be in the hospital #Debates2016
I. I. I. I. I. I'm very proud of this. I. I. I. That's all I hear when he talks. #debatenight
She wants to retrain police officers. How about restoring the finding Obama cut?? #debatenight
SHE started the birther movement, People. In 2008. She lies &amp; lies &amp; lies.  #debatenight
WOW! H. You really want to talk about being under investigation by the DOJ??? How about current FBI &amp; Congress investigation #debatenight
#Debates2016 " To the 1000s of people you have stiffed...."  Hillary
Hillary - You din't payed taxes ..!!Trump - Because I am smart ..!!  #debatenight
Trump is the rambling, creepy old drunk man in the corner of every Irish bar that you try to avoid conversing with at all costs #DebateNight
Trump's misogyny takes over. The dude can't stop interrupting and being an unmitigated ass. #bully #debatenight
#debatenight "by the end of the evening I'm going to be blamed for everything" #hilary
Clinton "That shows he didn't pay any income tax" Trump "that makes me smart" No mate, it makes you a fucking crook. #Debates2016
Just love how #Trump has gone quiet since #Clinton raised his racism. Not responding. #Debates2016
Patty Doyle. Gunna repeat that name nonstop for the next 24 hours sry. #debatenight
"Plenty of wealthy ppl don't get audited, I get audited every year. " why is that @realDonaldTrump ? #debatenight
"You know what else I prepared for? I prepared to be President" -@HillaryClinton #debatenight
Damn! He said emails already. Guess I should take a shot. Let the drinking game beginning. #debatenight
He's a champion for the African American community because we've "seen him" in inner cities? Did I hear that right? #debatenight
So I guess inner cities are any cities with black people? #Debates2016
I don't even love Hilary but STOP FUCKING INTERRUPTING HER.   #asshole #NeverTrump  #debatenight
"Because I wanna get on - to my daughter lol she hot as hell" #DebateNight

trump talks about oil more than i do when picking the right foundation for my skin type #debatenight
@LisaBloom "your president" .... guess DT doesn't consider PBO to he his president #debatenight #DTLIES
Ok that's official off the rails for trump.  You just can't go to temperment, that's like your thing. #Debates
"WRONG." This is #Trumps best answer of the night. That's how bad this debate is. #debatenight
About the only thing #Trump is right about? More Law &amp; Order. I love @nbcsvu. There should be more Law &amp; Order! #DunDun #DickWolf #Debates
You can't ask a part of the virus how to heal the racial divide #DebateNight
Settling with no admission of guilt is why you settle a case....duh. #debates
Did anyone go doink doink I the head when Trump said Law &amp; Order? #debatenight
Seriously, the moderators need to have a kill switch for the microphones at these #debates
How about people obey the law. This is not a race problem it's a criminal problem. #Debates2016
Hillary: well thought out, sensible answers  Trump: "I have property there." "That thing is so bad right now. Real bad. I know" #debatenight
Ok. It's the "law and order" folks vs. the rest of us. Who's  gonna get more people to vote. That's  the election. #debatenight
There is no legal reason why Trump can't release his tax returns. #debatenight
"Sidney Blumenthal asked Patty Doyle who asked McClatchey who went to Kenya....and I did a great job" #birthcert #debatenight  #wtf
Bruh #debatenight stfu bout isis i aint bout them comim here and huntin down americans
I swear I would lose more brain cells if I huffed a whole gallon of paint thinner #debatenight
So Clinton has been talking to police chiefs and both parties came to the conclusion that re-training is necessary/desired? 👏🏾 #debates
Idiots. Fucking idiots. Running for president of this country. Makes sense. #debatenight
Stop talking about stop and frisk, it wasnt a good idea, it'll never be a good idea. #debatenight
@realDonaldTrump has it upside down: you learn far more from tax returns than from financial disclosures. #debatenight
Now, finally, @HillaryClinton gets into where it hurts: biz practices ("stiffing") of @realDonaldTrump . #debatenight
!!!!!!!! RT @w_basquiat: AUDITS DON'T STOP YOU FROM RELEASING YOUR TAX DOCUMENTS  #debatenight
if Trump made $694M last year, WHAT DOES IT MATTER what businesses he started failed? 90% of small businesses FAIL due to REGS #debatenight
I feel like deleted emails are much different than covered up tax returns... #debates
The American people have been reminded why they hate this election. #debates
@Reince  Can U hand YOUR #GOPe candidate  Kleenex❓This #debatenight SNIFFING BUGS ME❗️😝  ? Where's #Evan .@Evan_McMullin during .@debates?

Trump seems to be slightly ill? Is it pneumonia or fear........ maybe a mental illness? *cackles* #debates #DebateNight
Um one thing I won't understand if Clinton wins the election is if Bill Clinton would be the first lady?  Im watching the #debates
This might end with "TRUMP SMASH" as Donald smashes podium and jumps out the roof. #trumphulk #debatenight
@realdonaldtrump still on unconstitutional stop and frisk, claims significant impact on crime. False. @debatenight
I can't vote, but if I could, I don't know that I could vote for either Trump or Hillary in good conscience 🙃#Debates2016
Presidential Debate drinking game for today: When the debate starts, start drinking and don't stop #debatenight
Seems to need a minute to remember her name between all the screaming. Sigh.  #debatenight
" Things that are important to me. That are important to this country. "  #Priorities #DebateNight
When are debates going to become tech savvy tonight to instantly start pulling up videos disproving claims made by candidates
This country doesn't think Hillary's emails are disgraceful, we think you are disgraceful Donald Trump  #debatenight
Audience cannot control laughter when Trump says he has better temperament than HRC, as incoherent words fly out is his mouth 😂 #debatenight
The problem is most of Trump's supporters won't rent to black people either.  #debatenight
The audience just laughed out loud at that one #temperament   #debatenight
"Takes advantage of the laws of the nation" hmmm. Well that's ok, I just hope he doesn't take advantage of the middle class... #debatenight
Why is he yelling so much? His shrill man voice hurts my ears. He's so much prettier when he smiles. 😂😂😂✊🏼 #debatenight #ImWithHer

Did Trump just seriously call our airports "third world?" He clearly hasn't been to a third world country #Debates
How did we go from race issues to hearing again about his investments #Debates2016
Tax Returns.. Not reporting,"That makes me smart." DT "This is something the American people have a need to see" HC  But emails #debatenight

@waynelapierrejr Please set Trump straight on the no-fly &amp; watch lists.    #Debates2016
I DONT KNOW WHO IS WINNING AND I DONT CARE FIGHT FIGHT FIGHT #Debates

Did Trump really bring up border patrol agent &amp; admiral endorsements to show how qualified he is on cyber security? #debatenight
My husband: "She should say, 'If you can point out Yemen on a map, I'll drop out of the race right now.'" #DebateNight

Listening to @realDonaldTrump interrupting...Does this guy even know what he's talking about? #debatenight hahahaha #baffoon
Trump is absolutely wrong on stop and frisk. I can't even. Judge DID rule its use unconstitutional. #debatenight
#debatenight Hillary could have just debated a bowl of bull dung tonight, because, my God, Trump is just full of it.
#debatenight you can't make blanket statements like the NRA are "very good people"
This really is a debate between a giant douche and a turd sandwich... Spot on #SouthPark #Debates
Aaron's mom just comes in and says "LOOK AT THAT STUPID FACE" #debates
God help those cities where Trump doesn’t have investments, because that seems to be the only reason he cares about a city #debatenight
"That makes me smart." - Trump on not paying taxes.... so..? okay. okay.  #debatenight

It don't matter who get elected America gonna take a L either way #debatenight
The way he cocks his head as if he's listening intently is so comical. What an ass!  #debatenight @MadYellowDog
Giving wealthy people more money?!  Are you kidding, Donald?  How has that worked?  #debatenight
mainstream media nonsense?  Stop it, man.  You're embarrassing yourself.  Lie and then double down on the lie #debatenight
And @realDonaldTrump retreads the tired old bullshit (YAWN) that audit stops him from releasing his taxes. Didn't stop Nixon. #debatenight
But rly, I don't care about Trump or Hil's tax return. I care about mine. Focus ppl, focus. #Debates2016
"Bigly" is to grammar as Trump is to ..... humanity? Nah, too generous to Trump. #debates
This feels like a bad trip. Is this real life?  #debatenight
#debtfreecollege hurts #taxpayers and what about all the college student that paid for their college...#debatenight #MAGA

clinton trying to appear composed in situations of distress to gain voters. It's not working. Hit back. He's clueless. #DebateNight
The @realDonaldTrump loophole is the knot he uses to tie up 13 year old girls before he rapes them. #debatenight
Is casino owning really a business?  Sounds like sanctioned stealing from idiots.  Probably people who are voting for you. #debatenight
"Maybe he didnt do a good job" isnt an excuse for not paying someone you have a contract with. #debatenight
Trump called out for being sued for not renting to African-Americans. Cant wait to hear his response to this. #debatenight
"We've got to address the systemic racism in our criminal justice system." - @HillaryClinton #debatenight #ImWithHer
If Trump shouts "Law and Order" three more times Dick Wolf will appear.                 #debatenight #PresidentialDebate #Election2016
I didn't think it would be this entertaining to watch the debates
this Presidential Debate is just a huge cringe-fest and I've said 'yiiiiiikes' more times than I can count #DebateNight
Hillary: “We have video of him stealing money out of a sleeping homeless guy’s pocket.”   Trump: “That’s good business."  #debatenight
I thought Trump's last answer was a commercial for his properties. #debatenight
Did he just say hackers in their bedroom weighing 400 pounds hacked the DNC? Seriously? What next? #debatenight
If this gets 25 favorites, will the United States change legislation so Obama (@POTUS) can run for a third term??? #debatenight #HHSMW
Will there be a "None of the above" option on the ballots? Please...? #debates #debatenight
Just gimme the whole damn bottle, I can't take this anymore #debatenight
NEW DRINKING GAME: every time Hillary uses a polysylabic word, Drumpf takes a drink. #debatenight #debates #debate #debate2016 #drumph
Clinton addressing sentencing disparity and systemic racism while Trump just perpetuates racial stereotypes #Debates
#Debates2016 in all honesty,  only morons pay their full tax bill. Same people that enjoy getting a refund instead of getting a bill.
BOI DONT TALK ABOUT RED TAPE WHEN YOU ABUSE IT TO KEEP ASSETS #debatenight
The people you want to vote for you don't know what underleveraged means. #debates
Donald Trump is the biggest asshole. It baffles me that Americans actually got him this far. #Debates2016
"We should have taken the oil” is actually the dumbest thing. Where are we going to store 112 BILLION BARRELS OF OIL? #debatenight
The police are behind you. That's a problem in itself. I'm sleep though 😴😴😴😴 #debatenight
Good for Donald making good relationships within the African American community over the last little while...he is 70!!! #Debates2016
has either of them actually answered a question yet without attacking the other yet?? #Debates
Radical Islam #ISIS has been around since biblical times.... long before BHO or Bush, geez!  #debatenight
"I will release tax returns after Hillary releases her emails" -BOOM   #debatenight
The only time Trump doesn't sound stupid is when he's repeating things Hillary says. #debatenight
Aww, he just used the word cavalier after she did.  It can be taught! #debatenight
Now Trump is quoting Joe Biden to talk about our infrastructure? Sorry @JoeBiden. #debates
i THINK HE WILL BLAMME FOR EVEYTHING BEFORE THE NIGHT IS OVERT #DEBATES IT IS SAD! I AM SO GOOD! #HILLARY2016 #TCOT
" Trump didn't pay any Federal tax" " That makes me smart" 😂😂😂 #debatenight
Trump is a getting stomped and acting like a real jerk with his constant interruptions and personal insults. @cspanwj #debatenight
How much is it socially acceptable to drink on a Monday night? #PassTheChampagne #DebateNight
- No amount of pizza, ice cream, Taco Bell, or Chinese food can make me feel better about this presidential debate. #DebateNight
The same man who asked for Obamas birth certificate hasn't released his tax returns😡 #debates
I wish Gary Johnson was at these debates. It would be nice to get to know our third option. #debates
Donald was just crying anything #Hillary says is a soundbite then here he comes with she doesn't want to say "Law &amp; Order" #debatenight
BO ran on the campaign of pulling our troops out of the middle east. Now what?  #debatenight
At this point I stopped rolling my eyes and I'm laughing instead. #debatenight
Looks like @realDonaldTrump should go to public policy school about impact is all about. That's why I'm at @GoldmanSchool #debatenight
Lester Holt: 'Given the civil and polite conversation we're having, let's move on to a more nuanced and important topic: RACE.' #debatenight
Moving to race. Not sure I can watch this segment.  #DebateNight
Trump...you are LOST brush! I don't know WTF you're talking about now. #debatenight
That microphone is going to disappear into the man's nose because of the sniffing! #DebateNight
Donald Trump thinks NATO is the guy who was living in OJ's guest house. #debatenight #Debates2016
When a candidate says "Law and Order" like that what he means is "I say nigger when there aren't black people around." #debatenight
#debates Well why the fuck do I have to pay taxes on my meager business revenue if this friggin billionaire don't have to pay a dime?
#UnlikelyDebateGuests Stupid ugly ass Paula Jones tried to get on TV by begging to show up at the #debates to rattle Hillary!
Did he just say it's all words and soundbytes in response to FACTS? #debatenight
#Debates2016 trump is putting his foot in his mouth and he knows it on racial profiling?
Ok hillary get to the meat potatoes she better say it #Debates2016 yes! Go hillary
Take a shot every time Hillary mentions her "middle class upbringing"... #Debates2016
Now this is what I want to hear about how these two can stop #cyberhackers #Debates
Boxes on boxes on boxes on boxes under boxes through boxes inside boxes on boxes with boxes beside boxes because of boxes on boxes. #Debates
Hark! Pay them only their due, and no more. They consume those who give themselves. #Debates
How can you be president of the United States if you don't even pay taxes?  Seriously. #debatenight
Trump met with a lot of black people?  And they spoke about something other than him empower white supremacists? #debatenight
What I've learned: Donald Trump's 10-year-old is very good with computers. #debatenight
#debatenight Trump want to say "niggers" so bad his mouth is watering
Trump just bc you say you started an unbelievable company doesn't make it true. I promise. No matter how many times you say it. #Debates2016
"The record shows that I'm right" 🙃 this entitled douche keeps getting better and better tonight #LookAtYourTinyFingers #Debates2016
"I'm satisfied with searching for Obama's birth certificate because I want to defeat ISIS" -man trying to become our president #debatenight
Does anyone wish the candidates were in the movie Liar Liar right now?  They're terrible parents... Americans are the ignored kids #Debates
Let's be honest guys... Neither Hilary or Trump know anything about race.  They're just saying whatever wins.  #Debates
Okay, Trump totally called what everyone was thinking about race being a win card.  Still don't like him. #Debates
Clinton: I have a feeling by the end of the night that I'm going to be blamed for everything. Trump: Why not? #DebateNight
it's easy to say what needs to do be done but I'm not hearing any plans on how these things will be done 🤔 #DebateNight
#DebateNight  Ask Hillary if she will admit having Chris Stevens run weapons from Benghazi thru Turkey to Syrian Rebels (the start of ISIS)
I think I'm gonna start taking a shot every time trump talks about how much money he has. #debatenight
Both candidate focus on fighting each other more than talking themselves up. #debatenight
Both candidate focus on fighting each other more than talking themselves up. #debatenight #HHSMW
Who are all these rich people leaving our country? Take me with youuuuu #debates
Not a lot of cutting in for Donald when the issue is race #Debates2016 #
Watching #debatenight in HD is terrifying because you can see exactly where their souls aren't
Donald Trump is the King of the Irrelevant Tangent. He'll do anything to avoid actually answering a question directly. #debatenight
There goes Holt giving Hillary softball for racist card. But she doesn't have the stones to call Trump a racist to his face. #debatenight
To be honest why bring up his businesses? It's the one thing that he can talk about in depth #Debates2016
Trump is such an egomaniac. I bet he'll lose many voters tonight. He's faking it and it's obvious!  #debatenight
What is he talking about again? Oh we were talking about his TAXES. He's talking about airports #Debates2016
#Debates LOL i like how trump just talks without the guy asking him for an answer but still he isn't wrong but what about the tax
He clearly wanted a laugh at that Pennsylvania Ave comment and didn't get it. Good job, audience. #debatenight
Trump has a better temperament than Clinton? You might want to rethink that #debatenight
Holy fucking shit he legit deflected the birther thing to ISIS. Clinton is straight up delighted. #Debates2016
.@Lawrence is going to have a field day tonight with this debate. I may have to tune in. #Election2016 #debates
Can confirm. Russia has attacked our network at work 2x this year. #debatenight
You've been fighting Isis all your life... No, I haven't... Yes, you have... No, I haven't.  #debatenight #PresidentialDebate
Smart move quoting @FLOTUS' "when they go low, we go high," bit. Go @HillaryClinton #debatenight
#debatenight How does bringing law and order back heal the racial divide?
Did I miss something, or is Trump implying that immigrants are stealing jobs as police officers? #debatenight
Trump tax cuts for the wealthy!?.. why am u not surprised! #debatenight
Is this a Presidential Debate that should cover policies/idea for our country or a group roast session? #debatenight #notgettingmyvote
Yes, keep arguing with the moderator Donald, gotta finish that rant. #debatenight
Did he literally make Jay Z's net worth in a year?!?! #Debates2016
there are two types of people:  1. #debatenight  2. #FormationWorldTour   #beyhive 🍋🍋🍋🐝🐝🐝
I'm in bed reading Into Thin Air because my nerves prefer a well-documented old tragedy to one freshly unfolding before my eyes #debatenight
Damn trump is killing it so far. Hillary needs to change her game plan Can see right through her rehearsed answers &amp; fake smile #debatenight
but really, lets just count how many times hillary says "uh" 💀 #debates
Stop and Frisk did NOT work!!! Donald has no education on this topic at all! #Debates2016
@terrymendozer @WeThePeople109 @realDonaldTrump - want to point out Lester Holt is a Republican before we do conspiracy theory #debatenight
I don't think it's disgraceful.  @realDonaldTrump is hinging on emotional pleas for old issues  #debatenight
"I was out while Hillary was at home" SHE WAS SICK YOU FECKING CHEETO #DebateNight
"NATO created a terrorism division. I'm not going to take credit for it but it's largely becos of what I said" - Trump #debatenight

So the man who has gold toilets is saying the US is overspending on everything?!? Cmon, man... #Debates2016
What do you mean YOUR president? DT doesn't understand the basic concept of American leadership and constituent advocacy. #debatenight
You cannot charge for foreign aid, Donald. That's not how foreign relations work. #debatenight
"You wanna know why I'm satisfied with the birth certificate? I want to defeat Isis!" #debates
Clinton: Yelling isn't cool, you know what's cool Don?  Preparing.  #Debates2016
I don't know.  Maybe.  Who knows?    I don't know Donald.  I certainly do not know.  #Debates2016
His love for the city is because of the $$ he's invested there....? #Trump❤️sCharlotte #DebateNight
Trump can't finish a single point on any issue. He starts on one subject and then rambles on to a something totally unrelated #debatenight
Anyone that does business with the Clinton's end up with a hole in their heads, at the bottom of a river. #Debates2016
Trump has the same relationship with debate rules as he does with facts. #debatenight
Hillary is the biggest liar ever. She lies because she has a horrible record. #debatenight
@weTODDDDid she takes a lot of credit for it. Where was she during Benghazi invasion? #debatenight
Turned down a turn up event for this  #debatenight no regrets.
Fact check: Law &amp; Order was canceled by NBC in 2010 #debatenight
He just said he's smart for not paying federal income taxes. He bragged about not paying taxes. #debates
I wanted to tweet something funny about Trump's temperament nonsense but it took me too long to figure out how to spell it. #debates
I love it when HRC talks about conflicts of interest. It's my favorite thing. #Debates2016
I'm sorry, did Trump just call us a third world country? #debates
Did @realDonaldTrump just come after fat people.......*eats chicken wing*...I disagree with that #debatenight #debate2016
Donald Trump's da sold Avon. That's how he could afford to give him a small business loan of $1 million dollars. #debates
Why is Trump sniffling so much? Is he ill tonight?  #debatenight
I'm not from the states, but I'm watching this debate because I love sketch comedy #debates #debatenight
is this man really out of breath arguing with hillary? lmao #debatenight
Honestly we are faced with two people that can make or break this country in the next 4 years. 😔 #debatenight
Lets talk ab YOUR campaign chair, Hillary, since you hired DebbieWS after she cheated the primary for you. #debatenight #PresidentialDebate
WHO CARES ABOUT THE BIRTHER ISSUE. LETS TALK ABOUT THE REAL ISSUES #debates

braggadocios is a word. i looked it up. wow. that's scary. #debatenight
@HillaryClinton missed a good one debating race. When I look at the color of Donald's skin I jump to certain conclusions...  #DebateNight
Trump "the endorsements keep rolling in. I just heard ISIS is endorsing me and it's beautiful ". #Debates2016 #debatenight #DebateNight
dude your "real-estate properties " are monuments to your own ego &amp; there are tons that r half finished &amp; decrepit #debatenight

HEY GUYS! The USA is a 3rd world country. Weird. West Africa felt a lot different than it does here... #Debates2016

Lol Hilary is also psycho this is like a prank. I'm just waiting for @aplusk to come on stage #debatenight
Trump: "black people are great! You know I know this black guy and he's great" #Debates
Don't even need to see the debate. I can just see the liberals on my feed taking a shit on trump #debatenight
I bet I could become President simply by preaching "ISIS" over and over and over. Cheers to @FamilyGuyonFOX. #debatenight
Take a shot every time Trump brings up ISIS during a question that doesn't involve ISIS #debatenight
Debating Donald Trump is like debating "trollboi69" on a CNN message board. #debatenight #debate2016 #SAD
Trump: we need someone good with money to run the country. ... You've been under audit for 15 years! #underqualified #Debates2016
Trump saying that if the US had grabbed all of Iraq's oil, it could have avoided the war for oil #debatenight
@realDonaldTrump You don't take advantage of our laws - you take advantage of the people you hire and the students at Trump U. #Debates2016
That's it @HillaryClinton  Laugh at him  Get him upset  Lose his temper  #DebateNight  #PresidentialDebate
Maybe if you paid your taxes we could afford the new schools and roads that we need Mr. Trump!  #Debates2016
@realdonaldtrump "you and your president" ??? He's your president too. At least respect the office! STOP RAMBLING! #Debates2016
Ok Donald, then name the various parts of our country #debatenight. Doubt you can
Wait? So him "hiding" his taxes is worse than you deleting your emails!?!? He's the one hiding something!? #debatenight
Trump agrees with basically everything Hillary Clinton has as plan. What are his own plans "I had businesses there" #debatenight
I tried SO HARD to be unbiased tonight, y'all. How long did that last... #debatenight
Am I just horrendously biased or is this debate a complete mess on Trump's side, as per usual? #debatenight
One candidate sounds presidential and it is not the one who keeps interrupting... #debatenight #debates
Believe me I was tremendous..just tremendous against Secretary Clinton in today's debate.. #debates #debatenight
As Conan said, this election is like choosing between gonorrhea and chlamydia  #debatenight
One thing they won't address in this debate: Why was Iraq ever invaded in the first place when it had nothing to do with Al-Qaeda? #debates
I tried watching the debate on Facebook. The comments remind me why I want to live in solitude on a mountain. #Debates2016
The level of disdain these two have for each other approaches my disdain for M*ch*g*n #DebateNight
Whoever had this idea for the fact checking on Hillary's website is brilliant. #debatenight
Use the force only when necessary? The force is always necessary! We will always need Jedi and Sith! #debates #debatenight #Debates2016
Trump: "I'd like to use my phone a friend to call Sean Hannity." #debatenight
i was the guy who shouted yeah when trump said hillary should release the emails. that was me #Debates2016
Racist Trump has no right to talk about--or for--"the African-American community." #debatenight
Airports like third world countries is false! We have good airport in the third world countries #Debates #Africa
Why was there clapping for #Clinton Audience was not supposed to react in ANY way shape or form #debatenight  #TrumpPence16
You know how in school they said if you don't know the answer pick C? When Trump doesn't know the answer he picks ISIS #debatenight
The bloviated smegma filled balloon literally admitted he hasn't paid federal taxes. #debatenight
It stopped producing marketable sound bites, so I realized it was no longer important. #debatenight
PREPARED and ready to lead! I am ready for her to be my President! #debatenight #ImWithHer
I don't love that in talking about "race," both candidates talked exclusively about policing. #DebateNight #Debate
@realDonaldTrump is now touting his temperament. Is he sure that is where he wants to go? #Debates2016
"He's making generalizations about the black community" - H  "Ugh" - D  #debates #blacklivesmatter
@carlswanson_ I don't think she'll mention it. She's been told to remain calm. #debatenight #Debates2016
.@realDonaldTrump wants to build new roads, bridges, airports, etc. How?! PAY YOUR INCOME TAXES! #Trump #Clinton #ImWithHer #DebateNight
Clinton needling Trump like a matador with a bull. Let's see if he takes the bait and charges #debatenight
@realDonaldTrump "I wouldn't start a war" wtf exactly do you think would happen if you blew an Iranian boat out of the water? #Debates2016
@HillaryClinton talking about being mad at tweets...didn't she tell @realDonaldTrump to delete his account? #debatenight
I wonder if Clinton is like this is gonna be a breeze or wow kinda insulted that my opponent is this or both. #election2016 #debates2016
I have a bad feeling that #Trump is about to say something negative about #keithlamontscott. #debatenight
Yes, "law and order" is not a plan, it's three words without explanation. #debatenight #ImWithHer
Only the toughest of sanctions will work for Hillary Clinton, except those that have to do with private email servers. #debatenight
Trump: "It's all words, it's all soundbytes.." Trump: "I built an unbelievable company..." #words #soundbytes #Debates2016
Our airports don't look as nice as China's! We better elect Trump! 🙄#Debates2016
If only I could get a "small loan" of $1 million #Debates2016
Whirling Centrifuges is the name of my new Alt Prog Rock band. @AandGShow #debatenight
Everytime Trump tells the mediator he's wrong take a drink. Or Hilary or me or anyone.....let's just drink. #debates
We're all just wishing we could "WE HAVE TO MOVE ON" #Debates2016
WHY DOES ANY OF THIS MATTER. ITS A FUCKING BIRTH CERTIFICATE. REALLY. #debates
Why does not wanting Obama to be president automatically make you a racist? Some of us actually just disagree with his policies. #debates
Like Don Corleone said keep your friends close and the muslims closer   #DebateNight
Donald, it's not because you snort every time she speaks the truth that it's no longer the truth.  #debates
Trump just completely buried himself within the first 30 minutes of this debate lmfao 😂 #Debates
Trumped up Trickle down.  It doesn't work.  Building the middle class does.  #ImWithHer #debatenight
hillary's smirk when she knows donald just gave her a good sound bite for a commercial. #debatenight
"Under president Obama, we have lost control of what we use to control" @DonaldTrump. #DEBATES2016
#Debates #Debates2016 we get peace by helping.  Trump cares more about money than peace.
"A man who can be provoked by a tweet should not be anywhere near the nuclear weapon." #Hillary #Debates2016 #Debate
@TeamTrump @realDonaldTrump didn't you people show him the video of Gore "sighing" and rolling his eyes during the debates with Bush?
HILLARYYYYYYYY 😂😂😂😂😂😂  "Maybe he is not as rich as he sounds" #Debates2016
Hillary is smart. I feel bad for her having to argue with that dimwit 😭 #Debates2016
Trump keeps saying that Hillary is all talk. Do you think he's just insecure about his lack of eloquence? #debatenight
So what is @HillaryClinton hiding in those emails. Obviously there must be something she really bad she doesn't want us to see. #debatenight
Is #Trump really trying to justify his denial of @POTUS's birth in America? One of the most disrespectful things ever. #debatenight
Why is Hillary talking about what Trump supported in the past? He was never in a political seat. #sameoldshit #Debates2016
lester: asks a question trump: talks about anything and everything other than an answer to the question #debates
@LesterHoltNBC Good job trying to keep cheeto jesus on point, as futile as that effort is. #debates
@realDonaldTrump purposely? I'm assuming you meant purposefully. It's hard to remember such a huge word, but step up your game. #debates
"Maybe they didn't do a good job." Maybe you're just a fucking crook. #debates
Trump: "Lester,-" Lester: "Don't FUCKING address me like you're my friend, I'm not your buddy, where are your tax returns?" #debates
Trump is like that jock who makes fun of the nerd for doing their homework then ends up flipping burgers for the rest of his life #debates
Trump is like "good for me" this, "good for me" that. Guys be proud of me #DebateNight
Does Trump really think that stop and frisk promotes good relationships between police and communities? #debatenight
My son is ten years old. He's great with computers. He hacked into the DNC #debatenight
@realDonaldTrump I want to defeat isis and get on to things that are important to our country.  #goodpoint #Debates
Is it just me or does he sound totally ignorant when he talks about computers and cyber security? #DebateNight
Hillary saying minorities are arrested due to bias law but in the 1990's she made a speech stating we should arrest them. #debates
"Law &amp; Order" doesn't mean letting the police do whatever they want, when they want. #Debates2016 #debates
Trump is honestly doing a great job so far balancing the beatdown with being presidential #Debates2016
Did he really tell Lester Holt that stop and frisk wasn't found unconstitutional and that the new NYC mayor stopped it? #debates2016
Trump is starting to turn more Orange as he gets more agitated. #debatenight
I love that HRC calls DJT "Donald."  Even his kids call him "Mr. Trump." #debatenight
He has interrupted at least 30/90 minutes. He should is some of his #Billions of dollars to pay for another 30 minutes. #debatenight
"You can release your taxes during an audit."  "YEAH BUT I'M UNDER AUDIT"  #debates
"This question is about race-" "Yeah, but i want to talk about crime right now. So I'm gonna do that."  #debates
Wait, you're all for NATO? What? But you just - I - huh???? #debates
He's speaking to such a large, uneducated crowd and it's so scary that people actually trust him...#debates
#DebateNight Like watching two spoiled children who got caught being bad trying to wiggle their way out of trouble!!
Trump: "My father gave me a very small loan in 1975 and I built it into a company that's worth many, many billions." #debatenight
"A very against police judge" - Nice use of a 3rd grader's dependent clause, Trump #debatenight @realDonaldTrump @HillaryClinton #ImWithHer
Both candidates have good points, BUT, they're not ALL good points. #debatenight
Trump talking about cyber hacking⬇️  It could be someone sitting on their bed that weighs 400 pounds #debatenight   I'm CRYING
I can't trust a brother who can't show their top teeth when they talk... #debatenight
Stop and frisk is a bullshit program for black and Spanish people 😐 #Debates
Democrats just can't give African Americans what they want: to be stopped and frisked by the police. #debatenight #stopandfrisk
Looking at that smiling ~ about not releasing emails ~ creepy ~ #debate ~ Hilary spewing delusion ~ weird #debatenight
I kind of like it that Trump won't even say Bill de Blasio's name. Either that or he doesn't remember it #debatenight
Hillary is every center back in the @premierleague and Trump is Diego Costa. She's trying to rile him up and make him explode #debatenight
I'm so deeply embarrassed/horrified that Trump is the Republican presidential candidate. #debatenight
"African Americans are living in hell " .. WHITE MAN HEAVEN BLACK MAN HELL !! #debatenight
If i hear one more broad statement that has no substance.... #debatenight
You know Lester Holt will be rage screaming in his car on the way home tonight #debatenight
Also, I don't care where you have property. Stop leading every statement with "I have property there". #Debates2016
You keep saying the word Temperament but I'm not sure you know what that means Drumpf #Debates2016
How much fun would it be to have our President drone "WRONG" into a mic when a world leader was speaking. #debatenight #proudmoment #sniffle
#debates @debates is clearly favoring Clinton in their crowd control requirement. Should speak to Lester Holt.
I genuinely hope this is the end of the orange fuckwit. #trump #debatenight
Mass run on booze stores as drinking games have dried up booze cabinets #debatenight
Trump... answer the question!! "Bring back law and order" is NOT a solution!!! #dummy #debatenight
Maybe it makes me an awful American, but I LOATHE watching, or even hearing these debates..🙈🙉
art installation #2: a list of "tens of thousands of people who love me." #debatenight
@Michael_Malecha same but instead of the knee i have the debates to watch
This story sounds like my Jewish grandmother explaining how she heard a piece of gossip. #debatenight
Get that man a handkerchief made from China and let him blow his nose #Debates2016
I don't even drink, but taking a shot every time Hillary brought up her "working class father" would be so much fun #debatenight
"It's all words, it's all soundbites ..." then immediately proceeds to spew more meaningless words and soundbites. #debates
"we are a debtor nation." Ya just like you are in debt Trump! #Debates2016
"Does Trump have ADD; can't stay on task or answer a staight question?  #debatenight
Lol you literally had an entire article saying you were supporting the war. Then 5 years later you don't #doesntworkthatway #debatenight
Hillarys handicap is she is so smart. There are a lot of folks who do not like smart women.  #debatenight
When Hillary talks about Trump, it sounds like she's reading about the contestant's mystery date #Debates2016
Is it a selling point that he gets constantly audited for 15 years?  #debatenight
Maybe it was a 400 pound guy. 400 pound guy for hacker in chief. #debatenight
Trump says he will release tax returns when IRS audit completed. But fact is he can release them now. #debatenight
"I settled that lawsuit with no admission of guilt."  Because it only matters what you say, not what you do, doesn't it? #debates
It's days like today that makes me wish his name was Richard instead of Donald #dick #debatenight #debates #makedonalddrumphagain
Trumps sniff makes me wonder if he's on coke or needs an oxygen tank #debatenight
Well, well, well...@realDonaldTrump is also #endorsed by most of America. (If you believe what he says) #Debates2016
These ain't the primaries of a failed political party, Trump. Go back to your white power fever swamp and stay there. #debatenight
Trump: "how do we heal this country? Well sniff I'll renegotiate the 13th, 14th, and 15th amendments." #Debates2016
What's the over/under on that water glass actually containing Trump Vodka? #debatenight
#debatenight moves on the the direction of the nation. First stop the issue of race
@HillaryClinton calling @realDonaldTrump a racist and Trump focuses on Clinton starting the Birther Movement #debatenight
"This conversation was about race" "Let me interrupt you black guy!"  #debatenight
Why is “Hilary” trending? That’s not how she spells her name, is it? Is it? #DebateNight
@LesterHoltNBC We got your back!! It's your first time for #debatenight -just pace yourself-you will be fine!! #debates
Can we talk about some damn policy points? Or like at least talk around them? #Debates2016 #debatenight
This Debate: "My thing is right." "No, the opposite is true". #Debates2016 #debatenight
Law &amp; Order is the same damn rhetoric that allowed the KKK to grow. #Debates2016 #debatenight
trump would do business with Pol Pot if it made him some money. #Debates2016 #debatenight
So a man who can be provoked by a tweet should not have his fingers anywhere near a nuclear weapon. ~@HillaryClinton #debatenight  #debates
When does he say "just kidding" and how many times will it apply tonight #debatenight
After watching #debatenight for a few minutes I really want #LetGaryDebate two candidates like #Trump #Clinton is a #loselosesituation
Trump: The wealthy are going to create jobs. They are going to do a tremendous job. #Debates   Enough trickled down already!
Hillary just ripped trump a new asshole with this rant about tax returns #debatenight
Hey Hilliary - I know an Article V too.  It's called the #ConventionOfStates #debatenight
"I say nothing...but let me keep talking" OKAY DONALD OKAY JUST DO U #debatenight
Clinton: "Everyone should respect the law" Then why do you support terrorists like #blacklivesmatter #debates #debatenight
#Debates2016 #debatenight #foxnews why police have to deal with mental illness on the streets; the Dems shut down the insane asylums
Who is behind attacks on Us ? Well who was SOS for 4 years ? Hillary #debates
I love how boldly Donald aggressively asserts things that aren't true 😂 #debatenight
He said SPECIFICALLY.That means what exactly will you do.Stop misdirecting like a dime store magician. #debatenight #debates #Debates2016
Wait what was that . WHAT WAS THAT NOISE HE MADE LOL #Debates
#debates "You shouldn't have a profit motivation to fill cells with young Americans." I would vote for that sentence all by itself.
I thought he got the endorsement of hte FOP a few days ago..#Debates2016
Trump is trying to deny all the facts instead of explaining them. This is bad!!  #debatenight
Hillary staring straight into the camera while Trump screams at Lester might be the greatest thing I've ever seen. #debates
Im trying 2 read between the lines 4 actual answer from Trump but am finding it like trying 2 smell the number 9 #Nothingthere #debatenight
But @realDonaldTrump can talk almost entirely in catchphrases w/ no substance in between AND maintain a smug face! #impressed  #debatenight
What about Benghazi? Good grief. Missed the best opp of the night. #Debates2016
NATO. Why aren't you all up in their face for not paying their fair share. #Debates2016
Now Donald Trump is the #1 threat to the world. I think she's grasping at straws. #Debates2016
There's that smirk again when the moderator mentions the need to move on. Hillary is desperate to run out the clock. #Debates2016
She let him speak, and he can't do the same. I am appalled. This is a man who is ready to be our President? #DebateNight #Debates2016
The whole crowd just snickered when you said you had a better temperament, they know thats bullshit. #debatenight
Honestly, I'm scared for my country. I'm scared for my future. Especially with how everyone is laughing at this sad event. #debatenight
Trump can NEVER take responsibility for his mistakes. It is always someone else's fault. That's why he's not a leader. #debates
Sorry Hillary, Obama did agree to remove the troops from Iraq. I watched that debate too. #debatenight
so happy this debate is almost over. Seriously stressing me out. #debatenight
"I think that I develop very, very good relationships over the last little while with the African-American community." #debatenight
Poor Hillary, she's so worried, rightfully, that the Donald will get away with all his shit. #debatenight
Does he mean "thousands of bullets" when he says "thousands of shootings" in Chicago? #Debates2016 #DebateNight
I wish I had something witty to say, but I literally can't even. #Debates2016
Are you smart enough to not legally pay federal taxes? Yes, good. Run our country. We need a leader with a good business head. #debates
Trump: "You have no plan." Clinton: "I've written a book about it, you can pick it up tomorrow." #debatenight #debate (RT USATODAY)
@realDonaldTrump just advocated a war crime and no one is mentioning this. #debatenight
#Debates Once again, he cannot stay on ONE topic! He has a few made up talking points.
Lester thank you for bringing it back. Don't let him deviate!!! #DebateNight
No one knows the bounds of what Sean Hannity is willing to say. #Trumpkin #debateNight
Don't criticize @LesterHoltNBC! He's allowing Trump to be exactly who Trump is...your crazy uncle. #debatenight
I'd super appreciate it if you could tell me what you'd read a blog about xx #poll #debatenight #blog #ideas #sortofadebate #VoteHilary
Trump had 3 major casinos in A.C. less than 10 years ago, around 10,000 jobs. Today, all gone. #debatenight
FACT-CHECK: We are not a third-world country. It's 2016, not 2050.  #Debates
"police are having to handle a lot of mental health probs on the street" @HillaryClinton. and the black families being killed? #debatenight
"BUHHH ME BEING A BIRTHER DOESNT MATTER BC SOMEONE ELSE DID IT TOO watertight logic donald, you got this" #debatenight #Debates2016
Hillary Clinton has been working this for thirty years and now she wants to fix it hhhmmm kinda late? #Debates
The line of reasoning from birtherism to Hilary Clinton is like a red piece of yarn on a crazy person's wall #debatenight
Trump calls out U.S. Budget - what budget?  #Congress no longer passes a budget, just appropriation bills to maintain fed funding   #Debates
I am a total expert on politics so I will post my opinions on how candidates smell like poopy butthole. #Debates2016
So black Twitter How should she  have answered this race question .... #debates
The originator of bait and switch is using bait and switch #Hilary #debates2016
I hope Trump gets a lovely night's sleep in his hyperbolic chamber tonight. #Debates2016
Apparently, Trump thinks he'll be more likable if he speaks directly to Lester. #debatenight #debates #Debates2016
Is it possible to mute the guy in the blue tie? #debatenight
Hillary wants to vacuum up intelligence from Europe &amp; the Middle East? uhhhh... #debates

I did it I did it me me me all me  #Debates
@realDonaldTrump do you have any other facial expression besides a boy that's been punished for something he knows is wrong???  #Debates
- Earth is flat. - No - You check. You check. #debatenight
To be honest Trump is coming across as a stronger candidate. He separated himself from politicians. Thats ingenious. #DebateNight
How many times is @realDonaldTrump going to use this "small loan" spiel #debatenight
Do you think China is watching our #Debates2016 and thinking how shitty we are
.@realDonaldTrump you are frightening. I'm ashamed that @HillaryClinton has to stand next to you #debates2016
If all you want is a rich president, you are living wrong. #debates
"You know what else I prepared for? Being president." BOOM. Mic Drop. #Debates
Trump is basically talking about protection money.  He wants to run the US like it's the mob.  #debatenight
"Ilegal immigrants have guns and they shoot people" Trump's takes are so profound and groundbreaking. Just say heil hitler and go. #debates
Trump says Mexicans are stealing jobs, nah bitch!!! we're working HARDER THAN ALL OF YOU to earn 'em 😴 #debatenight
I dunno. I'd rather have freedom of speech than sexy airports. #debates
Trump says the wealthy are going to help create more jobs. #debatenight Debates2016 #PresidentialDebate
You would still have ISIS-like groups running around even if you had left some troops there. #debatenight
This word vomit that he's spouting is giving me horrible flashbacks to Palin's word vomit #debates
I am so sick of Trump and his bully tactics. Have zero respect for him #debatenight
You know that part of Trump's debate prep was his advisors telling him he can't use the phrase "the blacks" anymore. #debatenight #debates
"We should do a lot of things and cyber is one of them" I've learnt so much goodly English with Trump tonight #debatenight
HRC has detailed policy. Don't agree with all of it, but it's there. #debatenight
Business bankruptcies 6 times. Bringing up verifiable facts on his business dealings. #debatenight
"I think I've developed pretty good relationships with the African American community" -Donald lol since when I missed the memo #debatenight
@realDonaldTrump, you look for every excuse to promote yourself.  How about putting the  spotlight on your fellow Americans? #debatenight
Trump is now just smizing at the camera instead of listening. #debatenight
Hurricane Katrina?  HRC's fault The existence of toupees?  HRC's fault Every Rickroll ever?  HRC's fault  #debatenight
Hillary showing strength and vision - Donald trying to claw her down with thug like ideas. #debatenight
Implicit bias is something we all have. We must put more into training police around mental health issue #debatenight
Mr Donald Trump yells a lot wo bringing up any of past mistakes by his party. #HillaryClinton super polite! #DebateNight YellingParty
LIKE THIS: YOU ARE SUIT BOUGHT WITH THE TRAGIC LIFES OF MANY AND YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT #Debatenight INTERRUPT HIM!
My heart just skipped a beat. Hillary, you had me at "prepared." #debatenight
Really looking forward to how the media will try to pretend Trump did well and Hillary didn't inspire anyone tomorrow. #debatenight
to cope with #Debates2016, i will instead just list things that are currently making me happy:  1) @Eagles are looking 👌🏻  #betterthandebate
Unbelievably Trump is using #DebateNight as a commercial for his new hotel!
I guess America's a third world country! Wow, you learn something new everyday #Debates2016
Trump Answers Questions The Way I Would Get Through Essays In High School. A LOT Of Bullshit #DebateNight
I know who I'm voting for come November — watching Presidential Debates 2016
TRUMP IS A MADMAN.  No one is laughing at Hillary's laugh lines.  #debate #debatenight
#debatenight Clinton is making a lot of sense but is she changing minds?
I'm listening to this on the radio. (#oldschool) does Trump look as angry and heated as he sounds? #debatenight
Did Hillary just allude to the fact that gun violence is related to race? #debatenight
HILLARY GETS A LOT OF MONEY FROM SAUDI ARABIA SHE IS THE BITCH OF THE SAUDI ROYAL FAMILY SHE ONLY SERVES SAUDIAS, NOT AMERICANS #debatenight
HILLARY GETS A LOT OF MONEY FROM SAUDI ARABIA SHE IS THE BITCH OF THE SAUDI ROYAL FAMILY SHE ONLY SERVES SAUDIS, NOT AMERICANS #debatenight
Is it too late @HouseofCards for Frank Underwood to be next president? #debatenight
Lester: How do you feel about space exploration and funding to NASA. Trump: I have investments and property in space. 🙄  #DebateNight
@HillaryClinton in your case, just sell the information to your buddies across the water! They don't need to hack! #debatenight #TrumpTrain
Answer the question Trump!!!! The public DOES have a right to know! #debatenight
The architect that she is talking about was trying to strong arm Trump for more money after he agreed to the contract. #debatenight
SPAM ALERT: I may spam your timeline with tweets due to #debatenight
We need a bigger basket,  and a lot more cowbell. #debatenight
I'm still confused whether this is a debate or Hillary Clinton on stage with a drunk heckler #debates
Haveing a feloney dose not mean your a bad person.   #Debates
America has turned into such a cowardly country and it's really scary and sad. #debatenight #neverhillary
Hilliary is smooth asf! Trump is just slipping all over his emotions. #Pray4Him  #debatenight
Hillary wants to raise the taxes on the wealthy...Has she not seen Clinton Cash???? looool #debatenight #debates
I wonder how long Hillary spent focus testing "trumped-up trickle down" as a way to describe Trump's tax plan #debatenight
Donald is just like "no but wait, wait, wait, listen to my story, it's important, just wait" 😂 #debatenight
This debate is ridiculous &amp; goofy. Neither are fit for Presidency! To run an entire country!! 😂 #Debates2016
Did people forget that Hillary used to be a lawyer so she's gifted at convincing people she's right #debatenight
FactCheck please - democrats and republicans agree on tax increases?  "Trump" #Debates2016
#Debates Sorry Trump. You don't get to negotiate about releasing your tax return!
#Debates "That makes me smart". No makes you one who doesn't contribute to the country that has given you boundless opportunity.
"I think you just criticized me for preparing for this debate." 🔥🔥🔥 #Debates2016 #debatenight
He just keeps throwing around the word "cyber" like a buzzword. He's literally just full of buzzwords. #debatenight #Debates2016
"Maybe he's not as rich as he says he is. Maybe he's not as charitable as he says he is." #debatenight
What has Trump been doing this entire adult life? Cheating and lying? #debatenight
The stop and frisk in New York was incredibly racist, like statistically racist. #debatenight
The one thing that will hurt Trump is saying "I agree with Clinton." #debatenight
Hillary should take a moment to explain what really brought crime down. #DEBATENIGHT
Look at Hillary keeping her composure like a professional. Something Trump knows nothing about. #debatenight
#debatenight Clinton is mildly amused &amp; disturbed that she has to be in the same room with Drumpf.
We want somebody who contributes to this country like everybody else #debatenight  #partyoflincoln
He took out a full page ad calling for the death penalty of innocent youth and says she said a terrible thing #debatenight #partyoflincoln
Soo America is a third world country cause our airports not poppin?? #DebateNight
Candidates are both scary.  Trump is going way soft on Hillary. Not even bringing up Clinton Foundation corruption. #debates #Debates2016
I've deleted 33K emails over the last 4 years. Not bc I'm hiding anything, but bc IT yells about my mailbox size if I don't. #debatenight
So, Donald Trump is ALL IN for ignoring Geneva Convention &amp; all international treaties. Great. This'll play well. #debatenight
Being president means you DON'T ALWAYS GET THE CREDIT. What the hell will Donald Trump do when this happens as president? #debatenight
Why do I feel like this crazy long "audit" is going to be over on November 9th? #debatenight #debates #Debates2016
So let me get this straight isn't Donald trump in a debate so how the f*** is he posting on Twitter or any of them Act #Debates2016
I wish I could say something funny about the fact that people support Trump, but at this point, it's just fucking sad. #debatenight
What does it tell you when Trump can lie on national television while victims of racial injustice are punished for the truth? #debatenight
Trump has gone from being not orange to being kinda-reddish-Grand-Canyon after yelling so much #debatenight
"That's another beauty." Trump is pandering to the hockey bro vote #debatenight
Trump: We need law and order. People in our inner cities are living in hell because it's so dangerous. #debates #debatenight
Smug @HillaryClinton thinks she knows more about business than Trump -- the name synonymous with business. #debatenight @TeamTrump
S/o to HRC for having the patience to debate with a child #DebateNight
So is this now a competition of who's the biggest racist? #Debates
@Jbean35 it is like a funny movie!!! until you remember this is actually real life... #imscared #debatenight
Donald Trump, who may be the president of the US just quoted "an article I just saw" as a source. Help us. #DebateNight
Apparently airports are what makes a country a third world country. Y'all ain't know? #DebateNight
I believe @realDonaldTrump just admitted he paid no taxes by saying if he had "it would have been wasted." #debatenight
Under what right do we get to 'take the oil?'  #debates
@Truthfulcod bro he just said something about Hillary being disrespectful to Obama during their debates but he's been being disrespectful
"It's all soundbites BY THE WAY America is a scam, I have a great business, Crooked Hillary" #debatenight
He admitted he doesn't pay taxes and stiffs people. *inhales deeply through nose* #DebateNight
and of course Trump pulls out the 'I'm not racist I've had plenty of relations with African Americans'  #Debates2016
You know what China's Debt to GDP ratio is estimated as? 300%. The US, which @realDonaldTrump says is in financial trouble? 71.8% #debates
Think about it. Hilary studied for a week for debates. And this is her best?
If nothing else I think we can all relate to Hillary and Trump’s seasonal allergies. #Debates2016
"I don't make attack commercials on you". Literally anytime I watch a @TheKingNappy vid I see a "HC lets terrorists in" 3 times... #debates
Bullying? ✅ lies? ✅ tantrum throwing? ✅✅ and ✅. And it's not even 9:30 #debatenight
What I heard Donald Trump say is $650m is really not a lot of money?  #debatenight
TRUMP to CLINTON: "You are the one who brought up the word super predator to describe young black youth." #debatenight
DT: I was never, ever for the war in Iraq (except for that time I was for it) someone call Hannity! #debatenight
sad that her supporters believe anything that comes out of her mouth #Debates
We can't defend Japan.  Holy Shit!  What next, Germany?  #debatenight
As far as speaking well, Hillary wins. As far as a new pitchman for nasal strips, Trump wins. #debatenight
Okay, his stand-up set has been weak so far but that "I have a much better temperament than her" joke really landed. #debatenight
"I will release my tax returns when she releases her 33k emails" -Trump to Clinton #Debates2016
MOST PEOPLE THAT MAKE CHANGE ARENT PRESIDENT BERNIE HAS AND WILL CONTINUE TO MAKE CHANGE #STILLSANDERS #OURREVOLUTION #Debates2016
Does Trump not understand he's a politician? You became one the moment you decided to run for President #Debates2016 #debatenight
Trump saying "that makes me smart" when it's implied he doesn't pay tax tells you all you need to know... #debatenight
On race relations, Hillary helped create ghettos in Chicago, Baltimore ,Oakland....   #debatenight
Omfg, Trump just did a mob shake up to other countries.... Omfg lol game over #debates #debatenight
Grandma had to stay home while Grandpa was flying around the country.  #Debates2016
every time I step out, see what trump had just said on my feed, I can barely believe someone would say that. this is the worst #Debates2016
Trump talks about law and order then talks about unconstitutional stop-and-frisk policies. Because "What do you have to lose?" #Debates2016
If Trump is sitting on his "Secret ISIS Plan" and keeping it from the Administration, he sacrifices 1000s of lives b4 election. #Debates2016
.@realDonaldTrump couldn't tell you what @NATO stands for, let alone tell you about its importance. #Debates2016
Donald Trump supports the extortion of American allies for m/billions of dollars. B/c screw him. #Debates2016
What is the big deal about tax returns?? He is a billionaire that has a good business #Debates2016 #debates #debatenight
NO ONE IS REALLY TAKING HIM SERIOUSLY AT THIS POINT, RIGHT??! #Debates2016
"...you decided to stay home..." yeah pneumonia is just a little bit of an inconvenience #debatenight
I can almost hear Hillary's knuckles cracking as she prepares her rebuttal #debatenight
A phenomenal lesson in calm, clear, articulate and intelligent communication. Thank you for your master class, @HillaryClinton. #debates
@Demos_Org was proud to be co-counsel on the NY stop &amp; frisk case. NYC we'll never go back. #debatenight
Bad people will always find a way to get guns. Whether they are legal or not. #debatenight #MakeAmericaGreatAgain
So who gave Trump the hand signal to back down? Momentum really shifted halfway through #debatenight
"I have a much better temperament than she does", as he yells and rants and disrespectfully argues against his opponent #Debates2016
If Trump snorts or inhales any deeper, his rug will get stuck in his esophagus.   So gross. #debatenight
Trump, it’s called RACIAL PROFILING LIKE LESTER SAID. Now let’s talk about the Wall. #debatenight
The reason why these debates will not end on time is TRUMP likes to go ON AND ON AND ON WITH STORIES, WE DONT CARE. #debatenight
Basically RT @SheSeauxSaditty: "How will you heal the race divide?"  Trump: "I'd racially profile Black people."  #debates
Everyone Knows Trump is a Shady Business Man. is this really a debate?  #Debates
Where's your tax returns Trump? You can't produce even though IRS says its okay even though you're being audited?  #debatenight
it was so significant it needed to be tweeted during the debates.
Great composure &amp; delivery of facts. Love the debating skills - on and off answer Hillary  #Debates2016
Can we please get the heck off tax returns and emails!! Let's really talk about the issues. #debatenight
It could be somebody that weighs 400 pounds sitting on a bed...wtf. If I'm a hacker, I'm offended.   #debatenight
Hillary calling out Trump for doing things in his own self interest 🐸☕️#debatenight
@ReddnAL @LesterHoltNBC I'm surprised &amp; disappointed 2. He needs to lead the way w/appropriate behavior in this kind of environment #debates
Trump is on a tear about why he was really against the Iraq war. "If somebody would just call up Sean Hannity."  #debatenight
No. You're credits from Trumo University won't transfer over to ITT Tech. #debatenight
Dammit, I thought I was safe when I put "Status of Forces Agreement" in my #debatenight drinking game.
Trump has nothing to say about racial healing because Obama produced a birth certificate? That's just nonsense. #Debates
In summary, you can't banana a tree trunk on the toaster oven with a Murphy bed. #debatenight
If anyone endorses this man after this debate, they need to see a doctor. Seriously. #Debates2016
Can't imagine why no one wants to talk to Sean Hannity. Or take his word as gospel. #debatenight
I don't know if it's from growing up in DC or it's just in my blood but, I love the Presidential Election season #debatenight
Someone sitting on their bed weighing 400lbs!! Best line if the night so far #Debates2016
Kellyanne Conway is watching &amp; doing shots of Cuervo while sobbing gently into a hanky sprinkled with Clint Eastwood's manly tears. #debates
#debates Gee: talking about how under-leveraged he is is going to really connect with poor people.
Take Trump to task for not releasing his returns! He's hiding conflicts of interests &amp; he lies about his net worth. #Elections2016 #debates
Thank you @HillaryClinton for bringing up mental health &amp; terrorism in the gun control debate. #debatenight #guncontrol
@HillaryClinton is so condescending &amp; creepy with her laugh. Can anyone believe anything that comes out of her mouth?Fake fake #debatenight
Donald is losing his cool.  That shows his temper. Not fit for president. #Debates
Trump: "I'm a monster who exploits the law and its loopholes that YOU never closed!" #Debates
Trump is like a kid bad at geometry. He knows all the givens but has no idea how to solve the proof. #debatenight

#debates bullshit Hillary Iraq Wanted US to stay When we were leaving!!!! Your full of Shit @HillaryClinton #YouRfullOfShit
@HillaryClinton wants to talk about monetary conflicts of interest? That's funny... Has she heard of the Clinton Foundation? #debatenight
trump: "that's what I said I am rich that's how I feel" #debates
Not paying taxes makes him smart?? #Debates2016 Yes,  he really just said that.
We need a president that'll build a wall between us and Europe, like right in the middle of the Specific Ocean👌🏽 #DebateNight
Well said Hillary at least you take responsibiliity for your mistakes, Donald should do so too for all his mistakes #Debates2016
#Debates #DebateNight Trump: "People in our inner cities are living in Hell. Almost 4K ppl killed in Chicago since Obama became Prez." #MAGA

"It was ruled unconstitutional"  "No it wasn't!" - Trump  #debatenight
I don't mean to brag and I do t mean to boast but I am rich bitch  #debatenight
Hillary said state actors and all these dopes I'm watching the #DebateNight with perked up like,"where do I send my headshot?"
realDonaldTrump: .HillaryClinton channels John Kerry on trade: she was for bad trade deals before she was against them. #TPP #Debates2016
Did Trump really just say that showing he paid no tax makes him smart? This just proves how much of a farce he and his campaign is #debates
I love how Trump uses his tiny hands and feminine index finger. #Debatenight
Next @realDonaldTrump reality show. A show where he literally names all the things he says he can "all day long". #debatenight
Donald Trump honestly believes Black people walk out of their home into Aleppo, Syria.   #Debates2016
Whaaaat?! He's trying to imply she's a racist like he is???? WTF... #NUHUH #Debates2016
Wow. You acted like an ethical person for once. Want a cookie? #Debates2016
@realDonaldTrump Just show your damn taxes idiot. Liar Liar Pants On Fire.👖♨ #debatenight
"That makes me smart" - no #Trump, it makes you an asshole! #debatenight
This just in: Donald's Trump's 10 year old son hacked the DNC computers.  Mystery solved.  #Debates2016 #ImWithHer
Lester Holt might as well pack up and go home lmao he lost control of the situation real quick #debatenight
Trump looks like a child when he is not talking,looking around and can't stay still #debatenight #Debates2016 #ImWithHer
She is so fucking arrogant. Do you have something to hide in your speeches @HillaryClinton? Who do you owe favors to? #debatenight #debates
I truly hate her fucking voice. Uh...you know uh...shrill sounds...cackling sounds...uh..., uh bc uh...raspy cackling #debates #debatenight
LMAO IT'S NOT AN ACT OF RACIAL PROFILING ????!?!?! DONALD BRUH #debatenight
I think @realDonaldTrump just likes to say trillion.  It should be a drinking game. #debates
#Trump is whining and why does he keep mentioning his "friends" ?? #debatenight
"Everyone should be respected by the law, and everyone should respect the law." -Clinton #debatenight
If you say it three times it magically becomes true…”Wrong..Wrong..Wrong” - @realDonaldTrump  #debates2016 #debatenight
Lester Holt, would you please demand that Trump give his sources?  He just says stuff.  #debates
@TheAmyBrenneman Apparently we are in a bubble... If I'm in it with Donald I'm gonna pop it myself #debatenight
Trump is supporting a law that was deemed unconstitutional but people still think he'll be a good president #debatenight
For the love of everything holy please complete a full sentance for once @realDonaldTrump! #Debates
Does Donald realize that being president involves being and working with politicians? #debatenight
Did Donald Trump really just say he has a WINNING temperament? Has he actually ever listened to himself?????  #debatenight
Why's he talkin about $ again aren't we talking about terrorism?? #debatenight
I can't help but think that there is a gold brillo pad on my tv with a blue tie #debatenight #Debates2016
@realDonaldTrump is confused again. Filibusters are used in the senate, not by the president. #debatenight
What pisses me off the most is that Trump keeps interrupting Clinton while she is actually making a good point #debatenight
Voting for Trump b/c he's consistently responsible with his finances is like voting for Hillary b/c of her constant transparency #debates
Goodness. I feel for Lester Holt.  He's probably thinking" why did I agree to do this debate? Is this for real?"  #debatenight
.@FoxNews You are a sponsor of the Presidential Debates. More voices = more choices. #openthedebates WE WANT ALL OPTIONS ON THE TABLE!
Most impressive aspect of the debate is Hillary's ability to stay calm like I would be punching him right in the face #Debates2016
I hope blk folk paid att to the fact that neither candidate gave real feelings towards black folks and their issues in Murkkka #Debates2016
Being audited by the IRS every year for 15 years is not something to brag about. #debatenight
"JUST LISTEN TO WHAT YOU HEARD." -- HRC ... Please, please let this guide your vote on 11/8. #debatenight #Debates2016
"a city I love a city I have investments in" is that how you determine what you are about trump? #debatenight
We know everyone should respect the law. HOW ARE YOU GONNA MAKE THAT THAT HAPPEN #Debates
Hilary: "I'm pretty sure I made Iran totally wait like... a few more months before developing  nukes" #debatenight #Debates2016 #debates
I wish Lester Holt would ask trump a got'cha question. Make trump say 'I don't know what that is' #DebateNight
"No one should disagree about respecting the rights of young men in those communities" #ImWithHer #Debates2016
I think watching Twitter during the debates is way more interesting than watching the debates. *gets the popcorn*
Tonight, I am so proud to say that I'M WITH HER! #debates 2016
@realDonaldTrump - "No wonder you've been fighting ISIS your whole adult life" in reference to #Clinton aha #debatenight #Clinton #Trump
Stop and Frisk gave racist white officers legal cause to wrongly arrest minorities, Trump. Y'all saying it like it's nbd #DebateNight
How are you proud that you got the president of the US produce his birth certificate? That's an insult to the system, fam. #DebateNight
Other world leaders are on a phone conference currently laughing at the state of our presidential prospects #Debatenight
25 minutes into the debate and we're in a yelling match! #Debates2016
Clinton says it's "a racist lie" that Trump didn't believe Obama was born in USA #debatenight  #Debates2016
Half an hour, I'm gonna say Trump's doing better only because I feel his ideas are more likely to connect outside his base. #debates
Trump saying "I have property in Chicago" was like the equivalent of saying "I have black friends" to avoid being called racist #debatenight
Clinton does have a point, Trump owes the country probably billions of dollars in federal taxes #rip #Debates
Stop and Frisked worked? Get ready for stop and show your immigration papers #debatenight
Oh. My. God. This is more insane than I even imagined. #debatenight
the shadows from the mike on Hillary makes it look like she is sweating, #debatenight #Debates2016
Can Donald Trump just answer the question and stop talking about shit that wasn't been asked #debatenight
Lester Holt really be like "your 2 minutes is up" under his breath as softly as possible #debates
ISIS is in over 30 countries? uhhhhhhhhhhh  Trump says he didn't support the Iraq war.  uhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh #debatenight
@HillaryClinton thanks for Preparing to be President, I wish I can Vote for you from Nigeria #Debates2016 #CNNDebate #USpresidentialDebate
If he were smart he'd bring up her transcripts. But he's not smart.  #debatenight
@realDonaldTrump speaks of bringing back law and order. I'd rather him bring back Walker, Texas Ranger. #debatenight
News flash: apparently black lives don't matter to Trump because he'd like to move on to things that are important to him. #debatenight
Oh yes you do learn a lot about a man from his tax returns, Donald. That's why you're withholding them. #debates
I think Clinton just sent her bat signal to her friends in the media 'fact checkers get work' #Debate2016 #debatenight
FYI - Stop and frisk did not go over very well among the diverse faces @utsc #debatenight
Did trump really just say we have 3rd world country airports? Are you kidding me rn 😂😂😂 #debatenight
#debatenight #Debates2016 Hillary dares to say Trump is hiding something! Ah, Bleached emails Hillary! #TrumpPence16 #TrumpTrain #MAGA
If he yells louder doesn't make it fact! All he does is yell non-sense! #Debates2016
Man, I should be a writer for @nbcsnl, because im thinking of some good shiznit watching this Presidential Debate #debatenight
I think we all need to take a deep breath and pay better attention. #Debates2016
Call Sean Hannity at Fox, because they're so trustworthy with their news. #Debates
America is no longer a country - it's a business. Vote for the Businessman #Debates
Blame Hillary - Just for the murders of our embassy staff. #Debates
Lester like "um I'm trying to get a real answer here" 😂 #Debates2016 #PresidentialDebate
Trump weight-shaming nobody in particular during an answer without any particular direction or point. #debatenight
Ok Hill I get it but DONT U DARE TELL LESTER HOW TO DO HIS JOB #debates
" I think my strongest asset by far is my temperament. I have a much better temperament than her, " - Trump  Hillary- Woooh!  #debatenight
@MattWalshBlog Coulda picked Batman. Might not show up to debates, but has Trump-level name recognition, and still more real than HRC.
Listening to Hilary Clinton talk is like listening to squawking birds in a pet shop. #DebateNight
X number of people have been killed in y years.  And it really is the biggest X. #Trump #Trump facts #debatenight
Trump wants to bring back #stopandfrisk   because that was his highlight of date night. #debatenight #TrumpHatesLove
@realDonaldTrump is almost correct. Businesses are leaving, however, because of government influence in the economy #Economy #DebateNight
BTW, when I use "better" about the candidates, it just means "less evil". #Liberty #DebateNight
@realDonaldTrump @HillaryClinton LETS NOT BAN PEOPLE ON NO FLY LISTS!!! IT'S AGAINST OUR 2ND AMENDMENT! #LegalizeFreedom #Liberty #Debates
'I settled that law suit with no admission of guilt' - so you paid them off then? #debatenight
Trump, Where are your tax returns?40 yrs Prez candidates have released returns #Debates2016 #hillaryfor@CO
"What do you say about racial healing, I say nothing" said Donald Trump.#Debates2016
I built relationships with the black community "Over the last, little while" = 30 days  #debatenight
I do not believe deader is a word. More dead? Yes, if you've been dead longer but not deader. #debatenight #ForReal
Law &amp; Order.... not NEW  Policy and Procedures and Community Engagement. #DEBATES2016 TRUMP CHECK YOUR FACTS.
TDOnline: RT SeanRossman: Clinton: If you're too dangerous to fly, you're too dangerous to buy a gun #debatenight
How does opening a club in Florida prove that you are capable of being president?? #debatenight
"I will release the returns when we get the 33,000 emails she deleted." #debates Hillary: 👺
"If we take all of the oil, terrorists won't have a leg to stand on!" -Donald's flawless logic. #Debates2016
Well that's direct admission Trump!,you admitted not paying any taxes! Wow! #debatenight
It sound like the #debates is even between Trump and Clinton but who knows, this is from Tweets after all.
When is someone gonna mention the gun emoji being turned into a water gun?!?!? Dont dodge these questions!!!! #debatenight
"Just listen to what [he] said" - Sec. @HillaryClinton   It was a racist lie. It was an attempt to demilitarize our President. #debates
#debatenight Super proud of Trump as Killery was the one to start the bickering 19 min to be exact intent he debate.  He's been behaving.
Sorry America but your politics is  subpar and SO boring. #Debates2016
I'm really watching the #debates  so I won't get a bad grade for  Thompson
YOU ONLY CARE ABOUT CHICAGO BECAUSE YOU HAVE PROPERTY THERE THAT IS LITERALLY WHAT YOU SAID #debatenight
Lester Holt, are we really talking about Birtherism?? There are real issues that have gone unmentioned #debatenight
You play golf on golf courses????? Thanks Trump learned something today #debatenight
Did Trump just admit to not paying taxes b/c it would be squandered by the government? #Debates
"I have a great temperament! I'LL KILL ANY MOTHERF**KERS WHO SAY I DON'T!!" #debates

"I haven't given Rob's of thought to NATO..." Really?! Be my president while you tell me how you wanna fuck your own daughter! #debates
Dear god, someone call and ask @seanhannity so he will shut up.  #debates
Our country is soo bad such a disaster that one man can make 649 million dollars #DonaldTrump #debatenight
When Trump says 'believe me' it makes me do the exact opposite. #debates #andimarepublican
The guy that makes the "come here baby face" when he is listening, total #racist #debates
#Debates2016 Donald Trump has already lost the debate; ranting and raving does not win debates.
She's skinning the guy alive. She's turning him into cottage cheese. #Debates
"when they go low, we go high… and obama went high" clinton quoting the brilliant #flotus #debatenight
I can't even do my discussion boards because I'm watching the debate... I guess its a good reason to procrastinate #Debates
#trump wants to take guns away and laud the #NRA in the same breath. Yeah that's going over well.  #C'mon man. #TXWatching2016 #debates
So #trump is fact checking as he debates himself. Really go check it out. #TXWatching2016 #Debates2016
Obama for president, again. If Bloomberg can be mayor for 3 terms, Obama can do it too. #debatenight
I'd rather stub my toes than listen to this man.  #DebateNight
"Well at least I have a plan to fight ISIS." Yeah! #debatenight
I have no idea what Trumpet is tooting his own horn about....#ramble #debatenight
I can't even keep up at this point, I'm calling my #debatenight coverage here
We'll likely never see Trump's tax returns if he waits until audits come back "clean"#Debates2016
Trump not saying how to bring back law and order. Just repeating the soundbite. #debatenight
Banning people on terrorist watchlist not good policy until watchlist is improved.Too many innocents would have rights limited #debatenight
Clinton attacking Trump on nuclear proliferation. It's a bit niche, but tying it to his poor attitude is smart. #debatenight
@realDonaldTrump I have news for you, NOT ALL PEOPLE OF COLOR LIVE IN THE INNER CITY. #debatenight
Take the guns away from criminals but what about murderous police......!?!? #debatenight
Why he always look suspicious like max from max and Ruby. I can't trust him  #debatenight
"It's an unbelievable company." First truthful thing he's said tonight. Yep. I don't believe it. #debatenight
I wish I could give @HillaryClinton a sip of my wine. BUT I'm out... #debatenight
I'm not sure those who are saying  HC is not doing well are watching the same show #Debates
This is where we devolve into conspiracy land. He’d retweet pepe memes know if he had his phone. #debatenight
#debatenight Clinton says that Trump don't paid federal tributes, LMAO is a very funny debate !
WHY CAN'T YOU JUST DEBATE INSTEAD OF BEING SO VAGUELY PASSIVE AGGRESSIVE #debatenight
Did the man on the TV just say "we have to do cyber better".  I used to be a champ at cyber.  #debatenight
Donald just had about 30 seconds of full screen time #debatenight that was weird Imp
@realdonaldtrump can I please introduce you to my friend Complete Sentence?  #debatenight
Wait what does this have to do with Oscar winner Patricia Arquette in CSI: CYBER? #DebateNight
This is really amusing until you realize this is the future of our country #Debates2016
She's is going in on him on the birther lie he told #debatenight
There are some very confused Republicans right now trying to remember their party policy. #debatenight
“Murders are up!” — Drumpf will not be denied his violent statistics. Also: Drumpf does not understand how work the statistics. #debatenight
Trump: I really believe the black community wanted me to get there? Really, Donald? Where are they? #debatenight
In terms of looking presidential @HillaryClinton is winning. @realDonaldTrump seems less amateurish than normal though #debates #debatenight
@NaomiWilliams he's afraid of #Trump's screaming &amp; ranting. Most #media types are. It's pathetic. #debates
Yes, Lord, she is going there on #Trump's &amp; his father's #RACIST history! READ. FOR. POINTS. #HillaryClinton #debates
Just fyi everyone. There's no such thing as "reforming" a racist institution. #Debates2016
I'm not even going to go in on the systemic racism not only in out criminal justice system but in housing, jobs, casting, loans #Debates2016
LET'S TALK ABOUT FUCKING DYLAN ROOF. THAT WAS A TERRORIST TOO @realDonaldTrump @HillaryClinton #Debates2016
"Well, just listen to what you just heard"  *CROWD LAUGHS* @HillaryClinton calling it like it is #debatenight
Really surprised Hillary is actually showing her teeth. Reports before the debates showed she was going to let Donald implode.
It's like watching two pigs fight over a truffle.  They'll take something valuable and turn it into pigshit.  #debatenight
WHEW!!! Well, it's all over now. Trump just said he wouldn't do First Strike.  But wait... China should go into North Korea.  #debatenight
Who are all these whack jobs in the audience laughing at everything #Hillary says she's not Charming or charismatic! #debatenight #debates
Trump: People did get paid a lot but I take advantage of the laws of the country. #debatenight
Trump is advocating for stop and frisk as a way to get more law and order; says it's not racial profiling #debatenight
Isn't being audited constantly by the IRS a sign you're a crook? #debatenight
So we're Third World country because our airports need some renovations? K #debatenight
HE SAID YUGE HE SAID YUGE  He said it. Finish your drink. #debatenight
The only thing "third world country" is the way we treat women still Donald. #debatenight
#debatenight what I have learned so far is that we are just completely screwed.
Did @realDonaldTrump just say @HillaryClinton had been fighting ISIS her "WHOLE adult life"? #Debates2016 #TrumpSniffle #math
donald says the word "china" like he's doing a racist impression of a chinese person #Debates
waht   the     F UCK was he talking about? what the fuck was the answer even?  #debatenight
My main question for the candidates: what are you gonna do to avenge Harambe's death?!? #DebateNight
#Debates You know, temperaments, I love 'em, always have, and my temperaments, the best. look at crooked Hillary's temperament. sad - Trump
@realDonaldTrump is proud that he has gotten filthy rich by taking advantage of tax law - that's POTUS value? #DebateNight
Audience explicitly told no reaction/applause. Sounds like a sitcom. Rest of the debates should be done with no one there besides cameras.
Donald is master in one thing and that's evading the question #debatenight
#DebateNight How would Trump know about our airports? He has been flying private ALL of his life? WTF??
YOUR 👏 WIFE 👏 IS 👏NOT👏 A 👏NATURAL 👏 CITIZEN 👏 YOU👏 HYPOCRITE! 👏 #debatenight
donald trump won't release his taxes  hillary had a secret email and deleted 3,000 or more messages   they both fuckin shady #DebateNight
OOOOHHH SHIT! stop and frisk oh shit! Oh shit! Oh shit! #debates
#debates Military style weapons - including in the hands of the police.  My suburban town has a tank - literally.  A tank.  Really.
Clinton sounds like she's talking from experience and Trump sounds like he's talking out of his ass. #Debates2016 #ImWithHer
Well Trump just lost the often coveted 400 pound hacker vote. #debatenight #debates
Why don’t they give Lester controls to Donald and Hilary’s mics? #DebateNight #lesterftw
Next debate they're just going to put up a list of questions on a screen and walk away for 90 minutes. #whatmoderator #debates
"We are a serious debtor nation"- Trump #Debates2016 because he hasn't paid any taxes!
Donald is like a preteen arguing with his mom, Hillary is the mom that smiles cause there's people around but once gone...#debatenight
"Clinton doesn't like to use a couple of words: law and order" That's a three-word term, man. Just saying. #debatenight
"You know what else I've prepared for? I've prepared to be President." BOOM!!!!! #debatenight
#debatenight He seriously just said that every single country is ripping us off. That would make a serious diplomat... not.
I'm thinking Donald did a line b fore the debate. That brutha is sucking all kind of snot up #debatenight
turned my couch completely in front of the TV. I have GOT to hear the #debatenight opinions on race relations. This should be memorable.
#Clinton, the feminist, who goes on and on about her Daddy, the draper, but NEVER even mentions her mother.  #debatenight
My four year old is crying while watching the #debates ahead of her time. #debatenight
Dicey territory for Trump to defend birther quest.. He knows it and pivots quickly to ISIS. #Debates2016
What's unbelievable is that he found any success in endeavors requiring any measure human interaction. #GreatAmericanShitShow #debates
He’s been all over the place. Kind of like his debate statements. #DebateNight
.@realDonaldTrump, no one was asking about Obama's birth certificate in 2012 because no one thought it was an issue. #debatenight
Trump- "I'll release tax return when she releases her 33,000 emails." LOUD APPLAUSE. #debatenight
@HillaryClinton @realDonaldTrump Trump doesn't believe a thing he's saying either! What's very scary is, some Americans do! #debatenight
@NBCNightlyNews @MSNBC @HillaryClinton @realDonaldTrump it's on tape! It's not lies! IT'S ON TAPE! All your threats #debatenight
Holt just slammed Trump, letting him know that he can release his tax returns during an audit! #PWNED #debatenight
Ramble On by Zep comes to mind when @realDonaldTrump speaks.  He talks a lot but says nothing. #debatenight
Nobody was pressing it. Nobody was caring much about it. Well I was. But nobody was praising it. #debatenight #Debates2016 #birther
I'm sorry. How can anyone with a even a rudimentary understanding of logic actually trek with @realDonaldTrump ? #Debates2016
Geez..someone check @realDonaldTrump birth certificate and make sure he's not 120; sounds like he's gone completely #senile #Debates2016
Can't decide which is worse: @realDonaldTrump's constant sniffling or the fact that he has yet to say anything constructive #debatenight
Trump talks about stopping violence and bringing back "law and order" to halt crime. #debatenight
"Trickle down didn't work"  Top 5 dumbest thing ever said.  #debatenight
"The man who can be provoked by a tweet shouldn't have his fingers anywhere near the nuclear codes." Bam! #debatenight
How do you heal the racial divide? Trump "Well, when I was in the KKK..." #debatenight
The DNC did not have American flags &amp; @HillaryClinton is not wearing an American Flag pin tonight #debates #BlatantDisregard
Aaaaand Trump interrupts again. "Let's start the clock again, Lester." 👏🏼😂 #debatenight
It takes an extraordinary talent to troll yourself and not realise it, maybe he does deserve to be president. #debatenight
#debatenight Why is there no moderator for this debate? Trump is just babbling like usual. It's a shame.Trump is still acting like a child.
1,000...3,000...I guess 2,000 people got shot in Chicago in the last 30 seconds #debatenight
There is was...Trumps first mention of the 33,000 missing emails. Audience seemed to like it. #DebateNight #Debates2016
Donald Trump is nothing more than a ravenous, salacious, ranting racist ✋🏽#dismissed #Debates2016
The number of times that "Trumped Up, Trickle Down" is going to be googled after this makes this a genius move on her part #debatenight
Trump: *I don't want to answer this question* "remember that thing Hillary once said?" #Debates
What to you say about racial healing? "I say nothing" - DJT #debatenight
"I have a feeling that by the end of this evening I'm going to be blamed for everything that's ever happened."Trump: "Why not?"#Debates2016
Im gonna take a shot every time Trump mentions his properties in relationship to an issue so I can die before this debate ends #debatenight
Is @HillaryClinton playing Trump Bingo? Seems to mark something down when he says tremendous, major, and believe me. #debatenight
Just release the tax returns. Why are you making so many excuses curve the question. It shouldn't be an ultimatum #Debates
Illegal immigrants are WAY less likely to commit crimes because they're extra afraid of getting legally caught and deported #debatenight
Black communities are war torn. God help us with this racist man. #debatenight
DT has noticeably calmed down. i wonder if one of his people in the audience signaled to him to ease up? #debatenight
holt is factchecking DT on his support of the war on irag. he's denying it. #debatenight
Anyone else think Trump just wants to watch Law &amp; Order on tv? #Debates
Can I not pay my taxes for a couple years lol #debatenight
He is bragging about his hotel he's building - I'm going to go to o e if his hotels and refuse to pay the bill  #debatenight
HRC calling the birther movement what it is: a racist, obnoxious, and hurtful movement #debatenight
DAMN SHE JUST CALLED AMERICA GREAT WHEN DONALD CLAIMS WE NEED TO MAKE IT GREAT AGAIN. WHOS AMERICAN NOW, DICK?! #debates #Debates2016
"Mrs. Clinton, you basically made Libya into an ashtray. How'd u like to respond?"  Clinton: nuh uh, Trump was for Libya too!  #debatenight
I'm so annoyed with Trump interrupting Hillary. Respect her time and stay on topic and release your tax returns #debatenight
Do you think from Trump's POV - everything is a giant cartoon? #Debates
#debatenight crowd laughs when trump says he has a better temperament than she does.
Tax returns will be released when the audit is done.  LMAO #nevertrump #debates2016
"I have a much better temperament than she has" -Trump  WHATTTTTTT.... IM DEAD 😂😂😂 #debatenight
This there a count on how many times Trump brought and blamed Hilary and Obama 👀😂 #debatenight
Can't wait to see the epic supercut of Trump inhaling with a force suited for 7 jet engines tomorrow. #Debates2016
Really confused about Hillary wearing a red shirt and Trump is wearing a blue tie #debates2016
I know I keep making jokes but it's a coping mechanism and it's all I have. #ImTerrified #ItsHorrifying #debatenight
Lester Holt sounds like a disappointed adult dealing with a shrieking child: "We have to move on" #debatenight
Does anyone know Donald Trump's plan on how to make anything better in this country? Just asking...  #Debates2016
Watching @realDonaldTrump is like an internet comments section come to life. Live, uncensored nonsense with no facts. #debatenight
the only guns that they should be talking about at the #debates are @TheRock's guns! #WWENetwork is
Trump is right about Hillary downing Obama in their race  #debatenight
All Trump wants to do is blame the next person, ok fine but how will YOU resolve #debatenight
Why does Donny keep sniffing??? Did he put something in his nose? 😩 #Debates2016
How is @LesterHoltNBC doing as moderator in the Presidential Debate between @realDonaldTrump &amp; @HillaryClinton? #debatenight #lesterholt

Hilary quoted shit that Trump didn't say. Good job, good job. Bravo. #debates
No matter what, our country is axrewed starting on my birthday (January 20). #Debates2016
Someone pays for all that stuff while you're "taking advantage of the laws of the nation." #debatenight
Enough about your father HC - have you used him enough ??? #debates
So... NATO countries should pay what they have to pay, but you don't have to pay your Federal Taxes??? 🤔🤔🤔 #ImWithHer #debatenight
Obamas birth certificate bullshit again?! He's the fucking president of the United States obviously he's a citizen. Dumb ass #DebateNight
Donny, you're getting audited because you've been caught cheating so often, they just assume you're going to cheat again. #debatenight
So Trump's rhetoric is 'I'm rich, that makes me a suitable candidate for POTUS' It might just work. #debates
HOW CAN WE HAVE BETTER RELATIONSHIPS WITH THE POLICE IF YOU LITERALLY CAN BE SHOT FOR BREATHING AND BEING BLACK #debatenight
I used to think #SNL was the funniest hour and a half of New Yorkers on NBC!  #Debates2016
Retweeted Victoria Aveyard (@VictoriaAveyard):  THANK YOU FOR GETTING HIM ON THE AUDIT @LesterHoltNBC #debatenight

literally Trump has NO IDEA what he's talking about w/ cybersecurity #Debates2016
Who is focusing more on Humanity and Human Rights ?  #debatenight
Wonder how long HRC had to practice that bemused smile as a reaction to such bull-headed aggression #Debates
Can the IRS just finish the audit? I'm sure they can expedite it. #debatenight
Anybody wonder if @realDonaldTrump could wipe his nose with his hair in a pinch? #debatenight
What I don't understand is Why Donald Trump is there! How the hell that happen?  #debatenight
When did this turn into an ISIS question? I thought this was supposed to be a virtual warfare segment? Did I miss something? #debatenight

Blood pressure through the roof! This orange man is an #asshat! Defending stop and frisk WTF!!! #debatenight
Lester, an automated Twitter feed with text-to-speech could be a better moderator than you. #debatenight #pnpcbc

I just don't understand the mindset you'd have to have to support Donald Trump.. he doesn't even know what he's talking about. #debates
Trump uses small words, it must be the order he's using that make them hard to understand.  #debatenight
Lester Holt only admonishes the audience the one time they applauded Trump. Interesting.   #debatenight #debates #Debates2016
Lester brings up a good point, being president requires making judgement calls. Whose judgement do you trust? #debatenight

#debatenight Deceptive #Trump seems not to understand the basic different between PROBLEM and SOLUTION. Trump just want to talk abt PROBLEM
I feel so bad for @LesterHoltNBC he is just getting talked over... #debatenight
Im super rich and im smart and dont pay taxes and and i just read something somewhere and its clintons fault #debatenight
Hillary says stop &amp; frisk is ineffective. She believes in community policing @13NewsNow #Debates2016
agreed stop putting people who sell marijuana to jail for     years and start putting away the rapist!!! #debates
Hillary should get 15 minutes of stoppage time after the final question. #Debates2016 #SoccerJokes
Every time trump talks, I swear my migraine gets bad af  #debatenight
@PolarVan the sad part is that I am usually the dork that enjoys debates but this is no debate
Police aren't afraid to do anything... they are afraid to interact, they are more than happy to shoot people #debates #debatenight
Hillary Clinton lying again about emails - we don't want your apologies, we want transparency #Debates2016 #ClintonVsTrump
So Trump is a candidate and moderator in this debate? Interrupting Lester, "No. you're wrong" #Debates2016
"I know how to win." Trump Well maybe it's time you learn how to lose. #debatenight #Debates2016 #ImWithHer
Juan Encarnacion has a huge at-bat right now for anyone that cares. #Debates2016
And for the love of God, Someone please pass a tissue and some Mucinex to this fool! #debates2016 #debatenight
Sorry but #Lester is way too polite to be an effective moderator. #debates #debatenight
Wow- Trump is struggling on the birtherism question. Total avoidance of answering. #debatenight
I love that Trump doesn't apologize for being rich and knowing how to work the broken system. #debatenight
@HillaryClinton says: "@realDonaldTrump paid no federal income tax" &amp; @realDonaldTrump interrupts again: "That makes me smart"  #Debates2016
Not paying taxes does not make you smart Trump...show your taxes #Debates2016
"I prepared to be President and that is a good thing" Yes #HillaryClinton #Debates2016
Trump endorsed by ICE? Since when can a federal agency endorse a candidate? #Debates2016
Clinton reminds it was Bush who stablished the withdrawal schedule in Iraq, not Obama #factcheck2016 #Debates2016
He speaks of the DEMs using the blacks for vote, he just said, I just made friends with Black folks the last couple of weeks.😭#Debates2016
Astounding that trump doesn't have any answers that include policies for the country he intends to lead #debatenight
Did Trump just admit there are years in which he paid no taxes? #AmericanHero #debatenight
"i haven't given lots of thought to nato" H O W #Debates
Taking advantage of the People!!!@realDonaldTrump  #debatenight how would you feel if you weren't paid the right wages!!?
Maybe there would be no ISIS if we left a bigly amount of troops. Then there wouldn't have been a bigly void. #debatenight
This is really happening. America is so exposed right now. The divide is so large. The rest of the world just laughs #debatenight
"Nope, nope, murders are up." 😂😂😂 not going to follow that up with proof huh? #debatenight
Trump stopped debating to frisk Lester Holt.  That's how we make race relations better. #debatenight
Trump got Obama to produce his birth cert. Who can get Trump to produce his tax return? #Debates
#debatenight so where are the policies ? Plans ? Fake wwe wrestling was better
"We settled the suit with no admission of guilt." Um, Don, you know that's not the same as being innocent, right? #debatenight #Debates2016
Stop and Frisk was used as an excuse for racial profiling !  #Debates #debatenight #PresidentialDebate
How upset am I about tonight's debate?  I double-dipped my chips....twice  #debatenight #Debates2016
At what point does Donald Trump acknowledge that he is a politician too?  You're on the biggest political stage in the world. #debatenight
Hillary: I prepared for this debate. And I prepared to be President.  Trump: I was a birther for five years #debates #debatenight
LESTER FOR THE WIN!! You better fact check that idiot on stop and frisk! #Debates2016
He *should have* produced his birth certificate before...? This is possibly the most offensive, racist thing I have heard. #Debates2016
Internet trolls are your core base @realDonaldTrump, don’t insult them like you just did. #DebateNight
Every time he says "wrong" must say "not wrong" &amp; "i didn't say" with "u did say" can't let subtext imperatives stand #debates #tytlive
We've become a 3rd world country?!?! Trump needs to get out more. #debatenight
Donald Trump is truly unfit to be President of the United States. He is nuts! #debatenight
bragging about settling a discrimination lawsuit without admission of guilt doesn't make you innocent OR presidential #debatenight
Trump knows about being treated badly, so obviously he's the right guy to speak for the black community. #Debates2016
Trump has spent the entire night looking like he's trying to figure out what Clinton is talking about #debates
#debatenight- Hillary is so composed- good for her for not spanking him.
How many times is Trump going to mention Mexico tonight?  🇲🇽🇲🇽🇲🇽🇲🇽 😂😂😂 Having a blast with this candidate! #DebateNight #Debate
BTW, in case you can't tell, I'm live tweeting the  #Debates People with lives can mute this hashtag, right?
If Donald did it right, he would have stolen from the black man in Haiti like I did. #debatenight
@HillaryClinton needs to close the 2nd half strong, just like she dominated the 1st quarter. #Debates2016
Donald  Trump is seriously a JOKE  ,blame  game at its finest ,he cant even answer the questions! #HillaryClinton #Debates2016 #LesterHolt
"That makes me smart." #TrumpPence16 campaign has 2b wincing over that #taxes Guess my paying tax bc civic duty isn't smart #debatenight
How to step away bc of a sick dog. What'd I miss? We onto #racism from #sexism? #debatenight #debates #Debates2016
I think I just developed my first ulcer by watching this tonight #debatenight
Smart strategy by Hillary, put trump on trial and to realize he can't help but talk about himself, deflects from her #debatenight
I'm done watching that ms Clinton seems to have more self control #Debates

GreenPartyUS: Mr. Real Estate vs. Ms. Wall Street. We're seeing why the D &amp; R nominees are so unpopular. Go Green! #debates #OccupyTheDebat…
Trump is trumpeting gun grabbing. "We need to take the guns away". The question was about how to improve race relations. #Debates2016
'I'll listen to the generals who support me rather than politicians'. The American #Haftar #Libya #debatenight
You'd think #cybersecurity would be in for @realDonaldTrump to discuss Clinton’s mishandling of classified material #debatenight
Wish Trump would highlight the fact that criminals have black market guns &amp; that no proposed legislation will prevent that. #debatenight
I did a service to the president. Trump what the fuck are you talking about? #debatenight
Thank you Hillary!!! #debatenight we need a president, not  a tantrum, reality star. #debatenight
Lol somebody laying on their bed that weighs 400 lbs is hackin the country #DonaldTrump this dude will say anything #debatenight
Lester is low-key not here for the bullshit. Small jabs but devastating. #debatenight
Did Trump just fat shame computer hackers? Hackers, feel free to reply to him cyberly. #debatenight
The irony of Hillary talking about cyber attacks and confidentiality. HAHAHA #Trump #debatenight
I'm sure @HillaryClinton an give a good, dirty read. But she's holding her tongue. #debatenight
Race.  🙈🙉🙊🙈🙉🙊🙈🙉🙊🙈🙉🙊🙈🙉🙊🙈  me when Trump opens his mouth to speak about race.  #debatenight
She's just going to start ignoring him, and it'll be two separate realities happening on the same stage. Probably already is. #debatenight
How can she lie about the birth certificate with a straight face? #debatenight
Hey Donald, things like roads and schools are payed for by people paying their taxes. #debatenight
Trump is Hurricane Katrina in human form. And the Saints are playing on Monday night Football   #debatenight
She did well in Politician School. They teach you how to brain wash the citizens of the US to get a vote, Yes it's a real school #debates
"Maybe because you haven't paid any federal income tax" She shoots, she scores. #Boom #Debates #ImWithHer
Reading @GovGaryJohnson's tweets about the debate is better than actually watching the debate. #debates #letgarydebate
@HillaryClinton posits Trump might not be as rich or charitable as he claims (ya think?), corrupt foreign dealings, and tax fraud #debates
@HillaryClinton wants to target implicit bias among police and everyone #debatenight tackles systemic &amp; institutional racism
Everyone's excited she's mentioning systemic racism but again, low ass bar. I wanna know what her PLAN is to combat this. #debatenight
Note to self: stay off Twitter during electoral debates. I've been on here for less than a minute and I'm already irritated????
The bully is treating this debate like a high school argument.  @realDonaldTrump #Debates  #abc7 #politics
How will you respond to economic and financial ramifications of a war between #Iran and #SaudiArabia? #Debates2016 #debatenight
Trump's about to double down on the lie that Clinton started birtherism. #debatenight
Is it just me or does Hillary look like The Joker #debatenight
Trump's temperament ramble was something straight out of South Park and I am loving this. #Debates2016
"You look at the Middle East it's a total mess." I wonder why... HMMM. #debatenight
they keep talking over one another assuming that one of them will stop but neither of them will #debates
Anyone who knows me knows I'm not a big fan of Hillary, but jesus, Trump really comes across as a retarded teenager here #Debates2016
I was right, he's exploding. Those in the front row, prepare for that orange goo.....#Debates2016
Tulsa mentioned in a presidential debate.  I remember what went down when his lying ass came here. Violence #debatenight
"Certain laws that are there" but I don't know what they're called #debatenight
Wow.  This is almost better than the "Chewbacca Defense".  #SouthPark #debate #debatenight #PresidentialDebate #Debate2016
With all that money, you'd think he'd invest in some lips.  #debate #debatenight #debate2016 #PresidentialDebate
What the hell ever!  You're doing too you asshat!  #debates #debatenight #Debate2016 #PresidentialDebate
the debates are laughable at this point. the fact that I tried to be interested in it tonight is laughable. idk I'm just ???? right now
"Well, Donald, I know you live in your own reality." - the debate summed up in one quote #debatenight
Idk how people honestly think someone with as little patience as @realDonaldTrump is fit to be POTUS #debatenight
It's ok guys, Donald's friends said his financials are in good shape. #debatenight
"We need comprehensive background checks and if you are too dangerous to fly, you are too dangerous to buy a guy" Hillary #debatenight
"You don't learn a lot from tax returns." Said no one. EVER. #debatenight
yes bc emails that did absolutely nothing wrong compare to your con artist lying tax returns #debates
i feel like donald only knows the word ISIS as much as he uses it #debates
"i have a much better temperament than hillary" well that's the biggest lie trumps ever told #debates
Whoa. Sean Hannity could have been a drinking game winner. Who knew? #Debates2016
The @nbcsnl writers are so pissed. There is no way they can do this better. #debatenight
Trump just knows everything. Everyone else, idiots.  He's the only person who says "lots of words" but says nothing at all. #debatenight
Ok I'm getting tired of Hillary saying "Haha listen to the funny thing that Trump said LOL!" #Debates2016
The only thing I will ever agree with Trump: Bring back Law &amp; Order....................the tv show #Debates2016 #debatenight
#TOMFORD not investing in his blue tie line for the Spring season #Debates2016
Omg! Go ahead..yeah yeah yeah he said 400 lbs which by the way is something to be ashamed of. Grasping at straws people!#debatenight
If you take a shot every time Trump sniffles, you'll probably be drunk off your ass and die #TrumpSniffle #debates
It's so hard to listen to him when he makes my ears bleed. #debatenight
Apparently, America is a third world country because our airports aren't as magnificent as other countries'. Nice. #debatenight
And now a fat-phobic comment. Making sure he covers all his hate group bases. #debatenight #Trumphates
I'm humble but I'm better than you thought. *Donald Trump tonight *#debatenight #Debates2016
I love listening about tax returns and emails during presidential debate said no one ever.  #debatenight
"You know what else I prepared for? I prepared to be president." #burn #debatenight
if I heard @HillaryClinton right, she said RACK always said "when they go low, we get high"... that's what's_up RACK. #debates
@realDonaldTrump didn't pay his taxes and he is a billionaire. What a shame. @HillaryClinton wins pants down for sure. #debatenight
Giving "law and order" as an answer to the race problem should scare the shit out of everyone. #Debates2016
"Well you know, Lester. That Dave Meltzer never gave me five stars. No wonder my friend Vince doesn't like him." #debatenight
"4000 people killed in Chicago by guns."  I thought guns didn't kill people #debatenight #Debates2016 #ImWithHer
"Somebody lying on their beds weighing 400 pounds." ---&gt; Now that may be the most memorable line of the night. #Debates2016
SHE HAS THE NERVE TO SAY HE HAS SOMETHING TO HID   ARE YOU KIDDING! #debatenight
Anyone else notice they're wearing the opposite color of their political party? #Debates #Debates2016
funnyordie: Hillary Clinton just made eye contact with the entire nation. #debates
No Hillary that is not how you stimulate the economy and create jobs #debatenight
Trump will release his tax returns when Hillary releases her 33,000 emails #debatenight
The real question is...How does Trump's wife sleep with him at night 😩#debates
Is Trump hinting at a new season of Law &amp; Order? Maybe he's directing lol #debatenight
#Debates Well to be fair Trump may be talking about Atlantic City, folks. I've been there. It's rough.
How is an open endorsement of the US becoming pirate state and stealing oil go unchallenged? #debatenight
I'm bored, with nothing else to do, so I'm just going to watch the #debates
Where you been Trump, this violence has been going on, but I guess in the Penthouse you wouldn't know #debatenight
We're a third-world country. @realDonaldTrump We're a serious debtor nation. No money, squandered on your ideas. #debates
Russia updating real good on nukes. @realDonaldTrump But we have to be prepared #debates
Lester Holt: "You know you can release your taxes while you're being audited?"  Trump: "I WILL RELEASE THEM AFTER THE AUDIT!!" #debatenight
STFU with your "third world country" comparison! Not even close you out of touch human tangerine! #debates
Trump says "that's life" to the idea of Nuclear War. 44% v 46% #debatenight nuts
Anyone notice that with each reference to a city, @realDonaldTrump follows with "and I know because I have investments there." #DebateNight
Couldn't agree with Clinton more. I have one rule for presidents, don't fire nukes. Trump threatens the rule. #debatenight
I really hate how Donald trump talks over Lester Holt let him get the questions out #debates
@realDonaldTrump please tell me one of those "fine" and "good" banks is @WellsFargo #debatenight #Debates2016
Oh, we need law and order because you have lots of investments to protect in Charlotte. I see. Okay Donnie.#debatenight

#debatenight feeeck I'm out of beer and Scotland won't let me buy more past my bed time..
Hillary is probably just standing there smiling the whole time thinking "I'm rigging the election anyways" #debatenight
Let's be honest, we have no friends in the Middle East. Certainly not Saudi Arabia.  If anyone thinks so, they're a fool. #debatenight
Dear Trump, it's 2016, stop using the phrase "3rd world country".  It's an offensive (inaccurate) anarchism #DebateNight
Trump is a bully and the type of male condescending asshole that makes me stabby.  #Debates2016
If we are going by money then let's make @BillGates the president #debatenight
Donald's answers are like his hair.. bland, weak, messy, confused and flat out ass backwards. #debatenight
Running a club is great Donald but can you run a country with more than 330 million "members"? #debatenight #pnpcbc
Trumps contour game is on point tonight tho. Look at them cheekbones, just need some highlighter bro #debatenight #Debates2016
I'm having such a hard time taking him seriously. #isHedrinkingWaterorVodka? #TrumpVodka #debatenight  #debates  #russianvodka? #serious
Let's start with the department of Justice.. Giving Hillary a pass #debatenight
As a 400 pound individual, I must remind everyone that I did not, nor have I ever, hacked the #DNC #Debates2016 #debatenight
I would say tonight isn't going well for Trump, but it's been like this for 15 months, no? C'mon America. This is who he is. #Debates
Part of the problems with our failing economy, Trump won't pay his bills. How much fed money has bailed him out. #debatenight
#debatenight Hillary making jobs?  No way.  She has no clue
#Debates2016 Donald Trump is unfit to be an intern at the @WhiteHouse  #debatenight #debate
If we're a Third World country, people are doing much better in the Third World than I thought. #Debates2016
I think Trump just left   Probably to go look up "implicit." #PresidentialDebate #Debates2016 #debatenight #ImWithHer
’That is the true way I feel’ – the new definition of truth these days, perfectly expressed by Trump. #DebateNight
It was a Republican who said that taxes are the price we pay for a civilized society #debatenight #WestWingQuotes

Police settled the Sandra Bland case with no admission of guilt #debatenight @HillaryClinton @realDonaldTrump

For the millionth time...Chicago is NOT President Obama's home town! #debatenight  #PresidentialDebate
"No one was caring much about it." Because you're the only person who cared about it. 🙄 #debates
Trump is commending stop-and-frisk yet it's been proven that this method unfairly targets people of color. #debatenight
Man, Trump is creepy. He takes me as someone who hasn't had a genuine conversation with anyone in a long, long time. #Debate #Debates2016
His explanation for racist real estate practices is that "many" firms were doing it. #debatenight
Hilary just told ya boy "get your money up" i hate 2016 #Debates
OMFG!!! This hurts my head. Oh wait, that is me smacking myself in the forehead every time he speaks. #DumpTrump #debatenight

@alksyyz was that called a commercial? That's what they are for ., The debates are not for self-promotion of websites and books
You heard it from Trump's own mouth, he feels entitled cheat people of pay if he is unsatisfactory with their work #debates
All Donald Trump needs to deal with racial inequality is a policy that was deemed unconstitutional 3 years ago #debatenight

Over 300 million people in America and this is who we have to choose between for president? Yikes. #debatenight
@realDonaldTrump says: taking advantage of the laws,so what will prevent him from abusing power like Obama?Talk abt more corruption #debates
Please, somebody give @realDonaldTrump a tissue.....that sniffing is getting old....and annoying.  #debatenight

at this point i honestly don't know what's going on, it's not like the gov tells the 100% truth anyway.. but still fun to watch? #debates
From what I can understand from these #debates is Trump has properties everywhere.
When .@HillaryClinton calls for an intel surge to thwart domestic terror, beware more unconstitutional spying on u by the NSA  #debatenight
CLINTON: As soon as she releases her 33,000 emails, i'll release my audit. #Debates2016
Debates2016 #debatenight #Debates  All Crooked Hillary Clinton has is cheap shots .. The longer u listen the more u want to shoot yourself
Trump: ...And that is the true way I feel.  But I honestly have no idea what he just said.  Something about opening a club?   #debates

I wish I could lose one pound for every time Trump says Mexico. #debatenight #NYDebate
They are addressing topics that Trump is clearly uncomfortable talking about: his money, race relations, &amp; Obama's citizenship. #Debates2016
In regards to the troops......Thank you Hilary! Again. It was not Obama #factcheck2016 #Debates2016
"We need law and order. If we don't have it, we are not going to have a country," @realDonaldTrump says. #Debates2016
Donald called Hillary "holier than thou". THAT's one reason we wanted Bernie. #NeverHillary #debatenight
@HillaryClinton is trying SOOOOO hard not to bust out laughing right now. #debatenight
Really America?! Really? Trump or Clinton? Come on guys, you are much better than this. Honestly, I'm disappointed #Debates2016🇺🇸
"Stop and frisk will lead to better police-community relations believe me." -@RealDonalDrumpf #debatenight
Slam. Bam. Boom.   Clinton: maybe that's because you haven't paid any federal income tax  #debatenight
Trump on race relations: we have to bring back law and order  advocates for stop and frisk  #debatenight
When does the trapdoor open under Trump? Hit the button, HRC. We are scared, annoyed and just over his charade. #Debates2016
Clinton "I have a feeling by the end of the evening I will be blamed for everything." #debatenight
Trump "You check. You check" on whether or not crime has risen in NYC. #debatenight
They need to flip the switch on his mic if he can't do what we learned in kindergarten--don't interrupt. #debatenight
I love seeing two old, white millionaires debate about race relations and poverty 🙄 #debates
that was so powerful to hear a presidential candidate acknowledge privilege and systemic racism. #debatenight
Lester: Do you feel ready to be president" Trump:" Yes, i do like peanut butter and jelly  #debatenight
Holt - why flip on birther issue? Trump: I got Obama to produce his birth certificate. #Debates2016
donald trump's 2 minutes on race relations will just be him blowing into a kazoo as hard as possible #debatenight
If Trump wants America to have a fair share,why wont he pay his fair share of taxes? "Its buisness" he says #debatenight
I get the feeling Trump is not well prepared, he must honestly be aware too...#debatenight
Trump his his first multi-syllable word:  #braggadocious. Congratulations on using an 8th grade word #Debates2016
REAGANOMICS HAVE NEVER WORKED THE WEALTHY DONT MAKE NEW JOBS THEY JUST GIVE THEMSELVES BONUSES #debatenight Trump is wrong he's dumb
What was different about the recovery from the great depression to the great recession? Infrastructure! #debatenight #bridgesnotwalls
Stop &amp; frisk did not reduce crime. Most people walked away. Crime was just on the decline. #DebateNight
Wtf he said 1000 then 3000 killed in Chicago since January. In two minutes.!!! #debates
Debate shifts to tax policy. Trump, Clinton breaking down plans. Both starting to get testy, interrupting each other. @SNNTV #debatenight
Clinton: He started his political activity based on this racist lie. #debatenight  @SNNTV
You're a racist piece of shit. So are you. Well, you're corrupt. So are you. I hate ISIS more than you. No, I super hate ISIS. #Debatenight
"Let's start the clock again, Lester"   THE SASS I LOVE IT #debatenight

@HillaryClinton is so cute tonight. She's holding her own and doing a "presidential" job. #Debates2016

And when the 2 of you took the stage, you shook hands...you didn't spit into each other's mouths...cuz that's how adults act. #debatenight
"I don't respect women and brown people. I have common sense." @realDonaldTrump  #debatenight

@Kurapika92 If you didn't wanna see trump not interrupt and not spew BS you shouldn't've watched the debates bud
Why can't the announcer ask questions like: favorite food, color, sex position, Etc.  #debatenight
#debatenight Trump is getting dried mouth because he is nervous and has no hard information to talk about he is not doing well. Very sad man
"We want to fight ISIS, but our allies have to pay for it!"  Typical answer of a con-man, @realDonaldTrump. #Debates2016 #debatenight
I don't know what's worse. Listening to the debate or listening to the dog lick itself #debatenight
Trump took advantage of the laws of the nation to stiff contractors.  #debatenight

Trump trying to pronounce "fifth" is so far the highlight of the debate #debatenight
"Stop and frisk" would be a great cocktail name. If any bar in Minneapolis creates a Stop &amp; Frisk cocktail, I'm there 🍸#Debates2016
I'm like 99% sure Trump is wearing makeup to deflect the orange lmao #Debates
Trump does nothing but talk in circles, talk about his wealth &amp; investments, &amp; blame Obama for all Americas problems. #Debates

Donald Trump really trying to say his racist actions were a service to everyone #debatenight
Topic of Charlotte and Tulsa coming up now. How do you heal the divide? #debates
His jibberish is just as incomprehensible to them as normal politics. So they ignore both and vote on his confidence #Debates2016
I seriously hope most of the comments made here, on Twitter, are not made by registered voters 💪🏼 #Debates
What's up with the sniffing? Is he sick... healthy enough...effects of long term cocaine... #debatenight
Tax returns don't matter. Using foundation funds to settle law suits? Or buy ghastly Trump portrait? Delusion @ #debatenight #HighStakesNov8
#Trump claims he has common sense. That's why he claims 400 lb fella hacked DNC emails. Delusional. #debatenight
"It would be squandered " Trump said about paying his taxes #Debates2016 #debatenight
LAW AND ORDER are actually three words, @realDonaldTrump. Jeez, for a business guy, you are pretty weak on the #basicmath.  #DebateNight
@realDonaldTrump, if we inventoried all the HIDEOUS things you've been caught saying, we'd need a month-long debate.  #DebateNight
Ok let's just get the elephant out of the room... do third graders have similar vocabularies? #debatenight
So trump admits he uses loopholes to take money away from hard working people. Amazing #Debates2016 #debatenight
#debatenight Drinking game: drink every time Lester Holt speaks.  *stays sober*
Not sure Donald knows how to admit guilt, wrong doing or mistakes of of any kind. Who's holier than though now? #Debates
Forbes: "If I don't get there one way, I'm gonna get to Pennsylvania Avenue another." —realDonaldTrump #Debates
#debatenight @realDonaldTrump gets applause for 'tax records for emails' exchange in a debate where applause is not allowed

HEY @CNNPolitics Hillary won hands down. Don't bullshit your audience &amp; say Trump did well. #debatenight #debates
Clinton says Trump refuses to pay people who worked for him. He took their Labour and refused to pay for their work #debatenight
As I said, Trump would stay calm only for 20 minutes. He's now the obnoxious bully that he actually is. #debatenight #Debates2016
Why did Holt get on the audience for clapping and cheering for Trump but is not doing the same for those cheering for Hillary.  #debatenight
Is there a half time in debates?  Trump needs Shoop to come in, and give him some adjustments.
#debates2016 Donald Trump can provide lists of various groups but can't name one at any given moment?
AR-15 is a cool looking rabbit gun. No military specs period. #debatenight #debates
I bet when Clinton is nodding all she is thinking about how much she wants to throat punch him. #debatenight #Debates2016 #ImWithHer
Man does he half post nasal drip or has he been snorting something??? #debatenight
Debate summary so far:  Hilary: Studied. Is roasting Trump Trump: played Pokemon Go the night before. 'so bad' x94683   Smdh  #debatenight
No admission of guilt is not the same as not guilty. It's more like got away with it. #debates
Unfit.  Was that the first time that word was used??? I guessed much earlier. Damn. #Debates2016 #debatenight
Trump says he made $694 million last year; meanwhile, I'm living paycheck to paycheck. #debatenight
Shame Ken &amp; Sarah Burns' THE CENTRAL PARK FIVE isn't streaming. Essential docu that ought to be available *now* but isn't #DebateNight
Trump talks about being a birther like that's a good thing... #debates
Trump claims to have been in inner cities...went to one mostly empty black church and a bunch of white suburbs... #debatenight #debate
@jasonsfolly Yeah I am sure he does. He likes the sound of his own voice. It's not over. Two more debates plus the VP one.
Wait a second, why is Trump wearing blue and Hillary wearing red, shouldn't it be the other way round? #debates
Sidney Blumenthal. Sniff. Birth certificate. I want to get back to fighting Isis! snif #debates #snifflingtrump

Turned on debates but all I got was the Judge Judy show.
"...who was a very against police judge"  Sure, give this guy the launch codes. #debatenight
Address the systemic racism in criminal justice system. More 2nd chance programs. End private prisons. Gun safety measures. #debatenight
"#StopandFrisk had a tremendous impact on the safety of New York City" - @realDonaldTrump #debatenight #debates
Never knew NYC, one of the richest cities in the world was part of a third world country #whoknew #debatenight smh.
It's time we stopped asking ourselves what we can do for our country and ask our country what it can do for us #ThePEOPLE #debatenight
I will give Trump the point that we have third world airports. #Debates2016
Trump on releasing taxes: Tax returns don't tell  much, but financial disclosures tell a story - So will he be releasing that? #debatenight
Damn she ain't perfect but if you think for a second he is a better choice after watching any of this you are insane. #child #debatenight
Muslims may be on the front line, but should we really put their lives at risk? #debatenight.
It's all words and all soundbites now let me counter with words and soundbites - the Donald #Debates
Does anyone in our government know wth is going on with ISIS? I'm not that confident. #OccupyTheDebates #debatenight
That's what she said..."take the guns away from the people who don't need them" #Debates2016 @realDonaldTrump.
Hey @realDonaldTrump! Lose it! LOSE IT!  LOSE IT YOU DISINGENUOUS FUCK!!! #debatenight
I'm flying out on Saturday, I'll report back on the experience of the airport compared to a "third world country airport" #debatenight
What will Trump say about racism for two minutes that will help tackle the issue of racism.... #debatenight
Immigrants are not the issue behind shootings, Donald. The fact that you think that is appalling and terrifying and racist. #debatenight
The Trump's orange is increasing. I'm seeing shades of circus peanut. #debatenight
wait a minute... did he just say "THAT MAKES ME SMART?" #debatenight #cantdeal
He's flat out avoiding questions at this point. Does the dementia kick in after 10pm? #Debates
#debatenight you started the Iran deal that was another beauty trumps funny
Trump:"I have a much better temperament than Sec'y Clinton," he says as he steamrolls her &amp; @LesterHoltNBC Really???  #debates
"I made a mistake and I take responsibility." @HillaryClinton owns up with grace. #debatenight

$650 milliona is a lot of money to Americans. You schmuck #debatenight

BOTH candidates received donations from hedge fund Renaissance technologies Trump's top donor, Clinton's 2nd hard to find more #debatenight
Trump is complaining about our country's infrastructure yet he is the one that doesn't pay taxes. #Debates2016  #nevertrump
Hillary is starting to sweat and wearing out. Look at how she's looking ill. #debatenight
Is @realDonaldTrump saying he should get a cookie every time he doesn't discriminate? That's ... not how it works. #debatenight
Did Donald trump just defend why he refused to pay people working for him by saying they didn't do a good job? Moron #debatenight
My favorite part of #debatenight is unfolding all of the liberals who tweet pro-Hillary garbage   🙃🙃
HRC listens to young thug  DJT listens to meek mill   fact check me bitch   #debatenight
#debatenight  once again bias against the republican candidate.  It's so evident it's laughable.
Apparently Trump is pushing for cocaine to make a comeback as well.  #Debates2016
Clinton: Increase taxes, with NAFTA in place what's still stopping private organizations from leaving, thus cutting more jobs #debatenight
Donald tries to talk policy and ends up sounding like someone who doesn't study for their presentation in 8th grade. #Debates
So Donald how do we cut taxes and pay down our debt as well as upgrade all these airports and infrastructure. #debatenight
Trump is acting like Obama is the only president there ever was.  #debatenight
@IIJERiiCHOII Can we bring up how loud you can scream as well? #debatenight
So, we're a third-world country, unaligned with the West or the Communists? The things I've learned from @realDonaldTrump. #debatenight
I just want some genuine policy out of these debates. Apparently these candidates can't deliver.
“thousands have been killed over the last 'number' of years” is an actual statement he just said. #debatenight
What actions will they actually live up to other than bashing each other all day everyday ? #debatenight
Oh yeah @realDonaldTrump, so because some are happy with you, it is okay to ruin the lives of a few others?  #DebateNight
@lenadunham awesome. Trump just crushed her citing her abuse of Obama in their debates. She's horrible.
Trump says he will release his income tax returns as soon as the audit is completed and Clinton releases "the e-mails" #debatenight
So to avoid the question, you want to throw somebody else under the bus an point out their faults. Smh grow up already. #Debates2016
Clinton highlights her progressive views on criminal justice reform and police/community relationships #debatenight
Trump is acting like a five year old at this debate #debatenight
#debates2016 @realDonaldTrump says he's trying to succeed for his company and his employees and that many people love him, @CBSDFW
Effective Debate 101 covered w/ my 6th gr Ss today: you criticize the opponents response, not the opponent. #someoneshouldtelltrump #debates
Holt: Let's talk about race. Trump: These are bad people. Period.  #debatenight
"I prepared to be President, and that's a good thing." BOOM!!! #Hillary coulda dropped the mic and walked off right there. #debatenight
Every time Trump says "I'm very proud of..." it is about a horrible thing he has done.  #debatenight
At some point, either Lester Holt or #Hillary is GUARANTEED going to walk up and smack him to make him top talking #debatenight
#Hillary is talking about NATO.  #Trump is going to have a small nap #debatenight
You wanna talk about not doing something? You wanna talk about apologies to people in the audience? #Benghazi #debatenight
#DumbDonald talking about the debt, but proposes more trickle on tax cuts that would add to the debt. #debatenight
Did Trump just roll his eyes at the mention of "black community"? #Debates
#Trump companies have every right to not pay contractors if they didn't fulfill contract; stop guessing #Hillary! #Liar #Debates2016
Oh @HillaryClinton you &amp; #Democrats have NOT done anything to help #BlackAmericans for 50 years. Give it up! #Debates2016  #Blacks4Trump
I wonder if by the end of this we'll hear #LesterHolt tell #Trump "I said shut the fuck up and wait your turn" #debates
Now we're arguing about who has temperament? You're picking the wrong fight @realDonaldTrump #debatenight
Donald is trying so hard to reassure everyone, mostly himself, that he's rich #Debates
Hillary recognizing that EVERYONE has implicit bias. I have never been more excited about a debate answer #Debates
@HillaryClinton next time just come out with two bottles of wine... it's what the rest of America is doing. #debates #debatenight #notrump

Wow, this episode of Black Mirror is intense. Oh wait, this is real life. #debates2016 #debatenight #Debate #ImWithHer
I remember a time when North Korea didn't have a nuclear weapons program. How did that happen? #Debatenight #Debates
wow the audience  broke the rules .. #Debates -  what is going on, they out of control -
Sometimes Trump's answers take way too much background and then I have no clue if he ever answered the question. #debatenight
If only they cared about white collar crimes and the housing collapse's impact on regular people. #debatenight
Trump - pay your taxes if you want better airports &amp; roads. Disgraceful that you are PROUD to admit you don't pay.  #debatenight
Anyone know what the speaking count is? @LesterHoltNBC does good job signaling @HillaryClinton but @realDonaldTrump drones on #debatenight
Wow, telling a black man &amp; the moderator, that he doesn't know what the AA community needs. #debates
If wish they would stop saying 'African American'... Black is ok. #debatenight

"I did prepare for these debates, and you know for what else ? I prepared to be president" #debatenight #Debates2016 #PresidentialDebate
If I tune in to #debatenight am I going to die of secondhand embarrassment over its awkwardness?
So according to Trump the solution to race issues in the US is police/ stop and frisk according to Trump? #Debates2016
@realDonaldTrump "i think i did a good job" at being a xenophobic racist  #potus #obama #debatenight

Lester wanted to move on and then decided to let Trump hang himself some more on race, as if that was possible. #debatenight
If you're too dangerous to fly, you're too dangerous to buy a gun: HC #guncontrol #debatenight
Trump is absolutely right about that case btw, NYC just didn't want to fight it #Debates2016

Not paying Federal Taxes makes him smart. He wants to take us backwards #debatenight
Donald wants to help us Hispanic and blacks by locking more of us up.  #debates

Trump is saying he will release his tax returns if/after he wins. What a douche. #debates #debatenight
Does he think it's a point of pride to be audited by the IRS for decades on end? #debates #debatenight
WTG Trump, definitely cut off the black man who is asking you to extrapolate on racism. #debates #debatenight
"I have property there" is Donald's response to every mention of violence. Yes, us too, Donald. That's why we care too. #debatenight
Hold up. Did @realDonaldTrump just racially profile @POTUS because he HAD to produce his birth certificate?!?  Holy Shit.  #DebateNight
Lester Holt is like Duke in Rocky 4 to Donald Trump's Ivan Drago! "It was supposed to be an exhibition!" #Debates
am I the only who is wondering why @realDonaldTrump keeps breathing so hard into the microphone #Debates2016
I'm watching @WWE instead of the debates tonight because it's more believable #debatenight
Trump: "I opened a business in Palm Beach, the richest community in the world, that isn't racist. And I'm so proud I did that." #debates

Man, if taking a drink every time trump interrupts is on your card, you're going to be wasted in about 10 minutes #debates
If @realDonaldTrump can't get a basic fact of the most important US mil sit. of the last 40 years how can he understand the ME #debates
Wait, did Donald just blame Clinton for us getting into Iraq? We can't time travel yet, so not exactly. #debatenight
I wish Lester would ask her if she's down with TPP.... Yeah you know me...#DebateNight
Free stuff, blame police and take away guns.... Got it ... #debatenight
Hi, Mr. Trump my name is google. I don't believe we have met before #debatenight
#debatenight thinking about switching to the west wing and pretending it's real
#DebateNight  Lester has fact checked Trump at least three times. Not once has he fact checked Hillary. Not once WTF
All 5 living presidents are supporting Hillary. Even Reagan's kids are against Trump. He has no credible supporters... #debatenight
NRAblog: RT NRA: P.S. Real leadership also means respecting the Constitution and defending the #2A for all Americans! #DebateNight NRA #Fre…
.@realDonaldTrump brings up his investments in referring to the "city he loves" in Charlotte. #smh #debatenight #Debates2016 #debates
Trump: I should be president because I opened an non-racist club. With that logic, #clubfur should be pres and they lost my phone #debates
Wait, I thought shes been fighting ISIS her whole adult life, now they formed after our Iraq exit 🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔 #debatenight #Debates2016
Clinton's come back answer to Drumpf's 'law and order' - perfect. #debatenight
Trump needs a history lesson.  Also: "We should have taken the Oil!" is Fucking Dumb.  People have a right to self-governance. #debatenight
A lot of this race talk is really just a big circle with no real solutions presented. #debatenight
Trump very very very good relationships in the black community a little little while #Debates
"Me talk dumb You talk smart. Me win." - Donald Trump #debates
Lester needs to put a leash &amp; muzzle on Trump and get him under control. #debatenight
SHE WANTS TO COUGH. I HAVE BRONCHITIS I KNOW THE LOOK.   #debatenight
They're letting him interrupt Clinton every second, but won't interrupt him when he lies blatantly about the audit. #Debates
Why is the weight of a hacker relevant?? Just another bully, shaming tactic. He cant say anything without a personal insult.  #debatenight
#debates Clinton just called all of America and the criminal justice system racist. Seems like a leader for all.
Trump: I think I've developed great race relationships over the past..."little while." #debatenight
At least Donald Trump sounds passionate for something we might disagree, but he sure believes it. #Debates2016
If I ever have to watch that man take a drink of water again, I'll be sterile. #debatenight #Debates2016
4th Amendment "[t]he right of the people to be secure... against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated" #debatenight
"Under budget" and "ahead of schedule" are Trumps safe words.   #debatenight #Debates2016
What's everyone talking about on Twitter about  #debatenight. According to Twitter trends, this: Fighting ISIS/48.2K Tweets
#debatenight HE JUST SAID HE DIDN'T PAY INCOME TAXES, NO WONDER HE GETS AUDITED EVERY FREAKING YEAR
I take advantage of the laws of the country.   #bragadocious #debates
I really hate using this word...but it really applies in this case: @realDonaldTrump is a serial mansplainer #Debates2016
Okay I'm over hearing about what y'all have said/done I wanna know what you're going to do for America!!! #Debates2016
Keep Chicago out of your mouth bc STOP AND FRISK IS NOT A SOLUTION  #debatenight
Why is there even a moderator for this debate? It seems as though Donald J. Trump has it all under control. #debatenight
#debatenight "Charlotte, a city with my investments," says Trump. Not a city with police violence.
I want to watch #debatenight with @Trevornoah and Jon Stewart. Imagine how amazing it would be.
you're saying all talk no action but what have you done trump since you've been running ? #debatenight #PresidentialDebate
i don't think trump spoke about cyber hacks but kinda piggy backed on hilary's response. where's your brain trump? #debatenight
Hey anti-government conservatives, did you hear that? Trump wants government employees to stop and frisk anytime, anywhere. #debatenight
Hilary has thought so damn hard about how to please everyone with this answer. #debatenight #pagent
He really loved stroking his ego. Praises himself 4 random shit. "Yes it was I that did the thing. Only me. I'm awesome. " #debatenight
Have the candidates stopped talking about tax returns and emails? My head was briefly buried in my living room wall #debatenight
If you don't learn much from tax returns Mr. Trump then you have nothing to worry about. Release them #DebateNight
Every 5th comment under the live transmission is "lets go to canada" lmao. #Debates2016
I don't like Hillary or Trump but I would chose Hillary over Trump any day. #debatenight
#Benghazi #Libya #Syria I believe diplomacy can work, I just don't believe @HillaryClinton understands effective diplomacy  #debates
I hate when people say "to be honest with you" ... Does that mean you're normally not honest? #debatenight
but but...@sallykohn -  @realDonaldTrump has a "winning temperament" - he said so himself! #Debates2016
Woooo these snapchat stories are killin me ppl keep em comin 😂 #debatenight #filters4dayz
Trump sounds as bad live as he does on Twitter. He's getting his ass handed to him and on done he claims to be king of lolol #debatenight
Omg the damn question is about cyber not what fake voters  #Debates
I could be inactive on Twitter for years but man is my feed lit during presidential debates #Debates2016
Trump wants to be President of a country he apparently hates. #debatenight
Trump is the high kid in class on presentation day. "Maybe if I just talk enough they won't know I don't know what I'm doing." #debatenight
"And I can't take credit for this, but it's mostly because of me" #justTrumpthings #debatenight  #Debates
@realDonaldTrump What are you going to do tomorrow 2 try 2 recover from the shellacking u received tonight. #Debates2016
Trump talking about AA community like he knows something about black people. What a joke. #Debates2016
if you can't see that Hillary will help our country so much &amp; will decrease racism you're blind. Donald cares about only himself #debates
STOP AND FRISK WAS AN EXCUSE TO OPENLY HARASS BLACK AND HISPANICS IN NYC FUCK YOU #debatenight
It's as I thought. He's going aggressive/hyper masculine, and she's riding policy and failing at humor/personality. Very gross. #debatenight
Where's Sanders with the "damn emails" remark? We need it right now. We've been over this; it was a mistake and it's over with. #debatenight
I love how well composed and unbothered @HillaryClinton in regards to Donald Trump shenanigans #debatenight
Why watch the debate when you can see the @Cubs win their 100th game #debatenight
Every time Trump says "law &amp; order" I'm gonna say "DUN DUN" #debatenight
It actually took longer than I expected for the emails to come up. #debatenight
1 hour mark, I expect Wayne Brady to jump out and scream, "Just kidding, America!  Here are your real presidential candidates!" #Debates2016
@realDonaldTrump can you explain why your excuse for being racist is that other people were racist too and you made money? #debatenight
We can't vote for Trump. He's going to appoint his 10-year-old son into a cabinet position. I can smell it. #debatenight
He literally just justified not paying workers he hired ... but he plans to get people jobs? #debatenight
They should put a fact checker on the right side of the screen during debates. Would go a long way or a half time fact check #debatenight
Just staying silent on this topic. I'm a rational thinker, this is an emotional irrational issue and nobody will listen anyway #debatenight
#debatenight DNC Hack suspects: Trump's ten year old son Russia China You Me
@realDonaldTrump is mansplaining &amp; yelling. @HillaryClinton is keeping her cool. So clear who I want in charge. #Debates2016
Wait wait, of course he wants law and order where he has investments...duh! #debates
I have a Bingo space reserved for Mara Lago. Please, please, Donald. #debatenight
"It's all words. It's all soundbItes. I built an unbelievable company." YOU'RE NOTHING BUT SOUNDBITES. #debates
Law &amp; order - We have 4 of them. SUV, Criminal Intent... #debatenight
Tides turning. HRC has nowhere to go. She painted Russia but he's right could be anyone. Easy on the 400 pounders ☹️ #Debates2016
When Trump praised his temperament &amp; I laughed so hard I HALLUCINATED #debatenight
We are talking about racial profiling... and Trump is talking about our Black president's birth certificate...#debatenight #Debates2016
$694 million a year folks. That's what we want leading us? I'm sickened. #debatenight
"I wasn't the only racist landlord and didn't admit my guilt. Vote for me!" -@realDonaldTrump #PresidentialDebate #debatenight #Debates2016
THE ONLY THING THAT GOT TRUMPED UP AND TRICKLED DOWN WAS MONICE. #debatenight
This is what it looks like when one person studied for the test and the other went out drinking the night before #debatenight
Sad thing is that some people take this idiot seriously when he brags about his businesses #debatenight
Trump calls for the dismantle of the IRS: "...you dont learn much from tax returns..." #debatenight
#debatenight We don't need his taxes!  Ha!  Well, Clinton, what about those Emails?  Bait &amp; Switch? Investigative reporting...that's a joke.
America has some of the best trained policemen in the world.  Period.  #debatenight
Why am I not surprised it only took a few minutes for Trump to get so angry and defensive? #DebateNight
Put money in the budget for "implicit bias?"  Sounds like a slush fund to me. #DebateNight. #GaryJohnson
#debatenight Donald Trump wants to become President to clear his debts with China, Russia, etc. A desperate act to save his business.
We cant afford ro alienate the Muslim community,  we cant afford to alienate any community~Clinton  #debatenight #whitehouserush
Trump: "a city I love, a city where I have investments..."  Note that word: Investments - not friends or family or colleagues. #debatenight
Trump was sued for not renting to blacks - why is he running for president?  #Trump #debatenight #Clinton
The audience actually laughed at .@realDonaldTrump's serious comments about his own "great temperament". Litteraly a joke. #DebateNight
Ok #HillaryClinton , I like what you're laying down here with second chance programs and mandatory minimum sentences. #debates2016
Donald Trump is a puppet of the vast ignorance in our country. We need intelligence in the white house. #Debates
If you took a shot every time trump said company or business you would have died from alcohol poisoning  by now #Debates
Are y'all paying attention or just putting @Snapchat filters on their faces? #Debates2016
Harm caused by Hillary's emails vs Trumps misuse of charitable funds to pay off legal debts #debatenight #Debates2016 not comparable imo
"We've got to address systemic racism in our justice system" -- Clinton. #debatenight #Debates2016
Fascinating watching on social media how different people are processing differently who is winning this debate #debates2016
Although it is comical - are Trump's comments during Hillary's replies really "presidential" or professional? #Debates2016
.@realDonaldTrump said he wants to take guns away from people who shouldn't have them. Which neoliberal candidate is which? #Debates2016
"...thankfully my laid father..." - (Hillary Clinton) my response: No one cares about your daddy issues #debatenight
"GUYS! What did we all agree on before this thing started?! No cheering!" - Lester Holt as soon as the debate is over. #Debates2016
Seems like Donald only knows how to get off track, avoid questions, and interrupt Hillary #debatenight
#debates both people suck a lot our country is gonna be pretty fucked ether way
Not a fan of either Trump or Clinton but keeping score and right now Trump 0 Clinton 2 #debatenight
Talks about how great his temperament is while throwing a temper tantrum #debatenight #debates2016 #trump
@realDonaldTrump CANT STAND A BLACK MAN "INTERRUPTING" HIM AND TAKING CONTROL OF THE SITUATION #debatenight
Trump just said US airports look like a 3rd world country ummmm #Debates2016
This must be what it's like when a man is screaming when he's drowning in quicksand. #neverTrump #Debates2016
"The best person in her campaign is mainstream media." - possibly the only thing Donald Trump and I can agree on #debates
So Donald Trump just admitted that he's a crook and doesn't pay taxes because he is "smart" #debatenight
It pisses me off how Trump said "Your President." Obama's your president too!!! Unless you're admitting allegiance to Putin 🙄 #debatenight
I wish @realDonaldTrump would bring up @HillaryClinton used her Public Service career to become worth 200 million dollars. #Debates2016
I just heard a simplified version of trickle down from Trump. No no no... #debatenight
Hillary is ready. Digging in. Pissing him off bout taxes. Trump gonna run out of water. Making ugly faces.  Has 60 min to go.  #debatenight
@LesterHoltNBC @realDonaldTrump  move on with the tax return question.  Noone cares what his taxes looks like #debatenight
@Caspar_Lee clax your watching the debates bc I'm not 😆 he really is a joke
When you're just trying to get some quality Twitter time in but the debates have turned it into a subtweeting war zone
"But on occasion I steal from America, vote for me!" -Donald Trump #debatenight #debates2016
@realDonaldTrump terrible on race relations question . Should've at least mentioned prejudices . #debatenight
I will release my taxes when Putin tells me it is okay after the hackers have cleared them #debates
Flown out of Newark and JFK and they are both fine.. JFK has a better wine bar so fuck you Trumpy #debates
I really hope this season of debates doesn't get cancelled this is good stuff #DebateNight
.@GeorgeTakei Plus it's on tape. Even when there is proof, Trump keeps lying. #debatenight
It's looking like a Trump win tonight. He looks presidential and on message. Hillary has no message other than I'm not Trump. #debatenight
I literally blink and lose track of what he's saying because he dances around answering the question so much #debatenight
Stop and frisk is a profiling mechanism and unconstitutional.     #DumpTrump #ignorance #Debates2016
Having recently gone through Tanzania and Amsterdam airports out of Minneapolis. trump is crazy #DebateNight
Clinton team obviously understood that the biggest weakness of Trump is his "businesses" and "wealth"  Just like his Roast. #Debates2016
Race coming up now. This is your moment to say something incredibly stupid @realDonaldTrump. Don't let me down! #Debates2016
Lester Holt needs to be replaced with Kanye ASAP. America needs you! #debates #immaletyoufinish
Oh! @RealDonaldTrump wants to tell #China what to do. Doesn't he have faith in the American military?  #debatenight
Trump criticizes #NATO for not paying his fair share -- but he hasn't paid his taxes or paid subcontractors in full #Trump #Debates2016
Not a damn thing! 🙄RT @Bossip: What the F**K did ANY of that have to do with race?!?!? #debates
If America is so hard on business mr trump how have you made all that money you claim to have but won't reveal  on tax forms #debatenight
Ranting incoherent Trump claims better temperament than Clinton. Audience laughs at him #Debates2016
#Debates2016 @realDonaldTrump still refusing to release his tax returns. Does he even pay taxes? Don't stop asking about tax returns
Trump's face is just so peculiar. I wouldn't be able to stand looking it for 4-8 years #debates
"I have a much better temperament than her" YOU'RE THE ONE SCREAMING RIGHT NOW #Trump #debatenight
Lol. Hillary is baiting Trump and like the orange bird that he is, he's falling for it. #debatenight #Debates2016
"Well, we're well behind schedule," @LesterHoltNBC with the segue of the week. #debatenight #Debates2016
The #IRS said trump has no reason NOT to release his taxes.  #TrumpTaxEvasion #Debates2016 #HillaryWon #ImWithHer #nevertrump
You can tell he's making this shit up!  He can't even name a friend or say a straight answer. #ReleaseTheReturns #SheWon #Debates2016
Hillary Clinton is too dangerous to handle an email account, let alone gun control #debatenight
China should solve their problem for us. China should go into North Korea. #debatenight
If I acted the way @realDonaldTrump acted while I was at school, I would be expelled so fast! #debates
Trump calling the US a third world country is offensive to us, as well as countries struggling every day #debatenight
That smile on #CrookedHillary ugly ass face looks like she getting butthurt by Trump #debatenight
All the sniffles... Trump must have terminal cancer just like he said Hillary had last week when she was sick #Debates
HRC: DT won't release his returns. DT: "That makes me smart." HRC seamlessly: That means nothing for troops, vets, schools... JEDI. #debates
'It's unfortunate that Donald Trump paints such a dire, negative portrait of black communities in this country.' 👏 #debates
HRC says there will be new budget for re-training police on implicit bias &amp; supporting mental health.  #debates
Trump apparently thinks he is a universal fact checker, even though he is almost always wrong #999outof1000times #debatenight
Yes, #DonaldTrump. It was the 400 pound person sitting on the bed or the 10-yr-old kid hacking into all these national websites #debatenight
'When you have Americans using their constitutional rights, that scares people' #debatenight #PresidentialDebate
That hotel is the only way you'll be on Pennsylvania Avenue, Donald. Good luck filling the rooms. #debatenight
I love Law and Order too, Trump! Olivia Benson is one kick ass lady. #debatenight
Listen and form your own opinions. @AP4LP would have wiped the floor with them both. #debatenight
#Debates2016 #debatenight #HillaryClinton  once again proves she is ready for commander and chief on foreign policy #Trump
"That makes me smart". No, that makes you a dick.   #debatenight #debates
Man. No matter his age, race, or orientation should be afraid of the area he lives in or how he'll be treated because of it. #Debates2016
Damn you Trump for getting the crowd to cheer. Damn you.    #debatenight
Maybe our airports would be nicer if you contributed to taxes, @realDonaldTrump #Debates2016
#PresidentialDebate #Debates2016 We are doom. Nothing they are saying is new. We deserve better. 🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸
He literally throwing out numbers that might sound real bad. Lol #debatenight
Okay but seriously someone hand Donald Trump a fucking tissue before he sniffs one more time. #debatenight It's the worst sound in the world
for every second trump opens his mouth I lose way to many brain cells #debatenight
WHAT IS HILLARY GETTING READY FOR, WHY SHE SHIMMY LIKE THAT 😂😂😂 #DebateNight
Saying that the status quo isn't working isn't really a rebuttal when it's the exact same thing Hillary is saying #debatenight
There are three fires around me and the debates on..I think it's a sign
it could be russia it could be china it could be a lot of people it could be the Hacker Known as 4chin #debatenight
Sean Hannity: ...hello? Trump: sup Hannity: you're calling me? Trump: yeah, no one else wants to call you bro, but I'm here   #debatenight
I simply cannot believe the duplicitous nature of @HillaryClinton who wanted to bring "super predators" (black people) to heel  #DebateNight
Wow cavalier that was a good word. Certainly describes him fully. A lack of concern and off-handed.  #Debates2016
I just want to slap Trump upside the head #Debates that's how dumb he looks
#debatenight #debate #Hillary2016 #Trump2016 Thank you for the clarification on the Iraq exit. Bush did it. #trump
Looks like Trump had to unbutton his coat. His tie is hanging loosely. #debatenight
#Debates2016  Donald built a great company taking advantage of the laws.
Trump sound like a man who just got his credit card decline. Oh that $650M debt isn't too bad...the buildings are worth $3.9B. #Debates2016
"That makes me smart" @realDonaldTrump .. a quote from him not paying any federal taxes #Debates2016 #debate #debatenight #releaseyourtaxes
#debatenight can Donald Trump focus on a question and give a clear answer? Answer the question Trump
Trump suggested Stop and Frisk in Chicago when it's already been ruled unconstitutional lmao #Debates2016
"You know what else I prepared for? I prepared to be President." #shotsfired #debatenight
Hillary Trump DebateNight - Clinton: we protect attacks by overloading the syems with more muslim refugees from Syria. ISIS country. right?
When u try to act holier than thou it totally doesn't work #Debates2016
#DebateNight. Stop and frisk will make the racial crisis worse.  He doesn't favor gun controls which he sights as a problem Hillary does
Trump is right, we're in a dangerous place. But he still has no ideas on how to fix that. #debatenight
Tax returns for deleted emails? Is this Trump's amazing deal-making talent? #debates
RT if this is true 😂😂😂"@olusegunmoyero: Trump finished water meant for him, been looking down for dt cup refilled #debatenight"
I think the reason the Romney-Obama debates were so boring is there was way too much policy discussed. #debatenight
Did everyone see the moment Hillary realized she was gonna be president? Her smile almost made her look human. #debatenight
Hillary is trying so hard not to be racist or not to come off being racist #Debates
Wait...isn't the majority of government that failed black communities, white republicans? #debates
Learning a lot about audits tonight...  This is good.  #Debates2016
Take a minute and imagine Donald Trump having control over Nuclear codes. Would you feel safe? #debatenight #debates
Now please can they mention global warming and environmental issues I would love to hear their opinion #DebateNight
He's right. We need to bring back Law &amp; Order and with Elliott Stabler. #DebateNight
wow did he just propagate a stereotype that hackers are fat #wrong #debates
Hi @JoyAnnReid. Is there any way I can request you as moderator for a future debate? #Debates2016 #Debates2016
#debatenight The Clintons are famous for accusing people of what they themselves ARE doing.
Man she is so fake and her voice makes my skin crawl. No longer blame Bill for cheating on her. #Debates2016
Why is the fact checker transcript not catching all of #debatenight? It's cutting out big parts of what was said...
Is it a requirement for the presidential candidates to wear the opposite color of the party they support? 🤔 #debatenight
#trumpstrategy Tell people "believe me" enough times will eventually convince them you're believable. #believeme #debatenight
Im losing so much brain cells right now, not only from both candidates, but by these trump supporters by me that are dumb af!  #debatenight
"That would not start a war."  For love of goodness #debatenight
I personally think we're fucked either way so I'm just gonna eat some ice cream and call it a night #debatenight
He is under leveraged - oh I get it now  #Debates
I think Donald Trump just tried to argue that it’s okay for him to be racist, because maybe Clinton is racist too. o_o #debatenight
Did he really say that using our constitutionally protected right to remain silent is disgusting? #debates
While the rest of us are paying 30%  #trump thinks he's smart for not having to pay his fair share in a society #debatenight
Muslim shooter = BAN MUSLIMS! Anyone else = DON'T TAKE MY GUNS! #DebateNight
what I know 100% is In every debate I have judged where an opponent yells they are lying and desperate. Guess who's yelling? Trump #debates
Next time Trump name drops an endorsement he should be shocked by a collar or something. No one cares. #debates
Trump champions stop-and-frisk policy, already deemed unconstitutional, while Clinton calls for systemic racism to be addressed #debates
@SpikeBeeJo @bathroommonkeys Thought the same thing altho his new supporter Eric Clapton doesnt mind. Cocaine... #debates
"..very against the police judge.." Was he Mexican Trump? What next from this buffoon? #debatenight

Retweeted GetUp! (@GetUp):  Paying no tax doesn't make you smart, Trump, it makes you a monster #debatenight
LaGuardia is in the middle of a major reconstruction at the moment. @RealDonaldTrump might know this if he ever landed there. #Debates2016
Hillary Clinton: Measured, reasonable, specific. Trump: Yelling, histrionic, petulant. Who wins so far? #NoContest #Debates2016
So y'all got a club in Palm Beach from Trump? 🤔 in a wealthy neighborhood were probably not that many black people reside..ok #DebateNight
OK now… Come for the neck of the NRA Hill!  She is kicking ass!  #DebateNight

Blacks kill blacks... Blame the guns. That was stupid, Hillary.  #debates
May be the first debate ever where one of the candidates is forced to take a timeout. #debatenight
Donald contradicts himself constantly and I don't understand how people don't recognize this man cannot be a national leader. #debatenight
I love all the political experts that come out during debates
Y'all hate trump but Clinton shouldn't even be eligible to run for president with what she's done 🐸☕️ #debatenight
Can @realDonaldTrump please show some manners and stop looking like he wants to kill himself every time Hilary is speaking #debatenight
I hate this man soo much... You made him produce his birth certificate?? You shouldn't have questioned it. #debatenight asshole.
"We should be better than anyone else. And perhaps we're not" - @realDonaldTrump   #debatenight #debates #USPresidentialDebate #OiNews
This man sickens me... how is he a contender I don't get it! #debatenight
Wtf does your @NRA backing have to do with what your saying? Just speak about the issue instead of yourself. #debatenight
It's a shame, that many Trump supporters will once again believe Obama isn't American. #debatenight
"I have a feeling I'm going to be blamed for everything that's ever happened tonight" "Why not?" WHAT? #debatenight #debates
"But there are laws that are there." Yes, and there are moral rules that we need our politicians to follow. There's a higher bar. #Debates
Can Hillary actually bring up emails in any form without lying? #Debates2016 #liar
You know, Kanye 202 0 isn't sounding AS bad right now #debatenight
Trump, you're the one that wants to expand the military. You're literally contradicting yourself. Pick a stance bro #debatenight
The illegal immigrants are the ones shooting people?? Like specifically them??? #debatenight
Also, poor Lester. The poor man can't talk at all because Trump is being a fucking DICK! #LetLesterTalk #debatenight
Hillary will defeat isis by hiring the same hitman she used for Vince Foster et al.  #debates
thank goodness they didn't let trump bring that air horn he requested on stage tonight #wrong #debatenight
Why did he have to produce the birth certificate at all?    #debatenight
You could say she's been trying to take ISIS "her whole adult life." #DebateNight #jokes #Trump
"I think it's disgraceful when people exercise their constitutional rights" guy running for president #DebateNight #Debates2016

Trump just said he has a winning temperament will rambling on over the moderator. #facepalm #debatenight
All Hillary has done is listed off what needs to be done, not what she's gonna do to fix it. #debates #debatenight
Donald hasn't given much thought to #NATO... Not something you wanna admit on #DebateNight bruh.
@realDonaldTrump Stop and frisk is unconstitutional in NY so it will be unconstitutional in Chicago  #NeverTrump #Debates2016  #ImWithHer
#debatenight   Ok, the crowd is straight up laughing at Trump now when he talks about his great temperament.  #Debates2016
The truest statement Trump has ever said in his life. Politicians always talk slick for black votes and then leave us to hang #Debates2016
Boom! law and order! Classic! Like No one ever lived through the 80's rhetoric! #debatenight
#dumptrump #Debates2016 Orange One: Quoting interview with Howard Stern is not validation of your position on Iraq
At least we know who the cyber czar will be: Trump's 10 yr old. I hear he's "good at computers." #debates
#debatenight we've become a third-world country. - DT No. So much no.
I'm not sure Donald Trump even knows what the truth is anymore. #debatenight
Did they just say implicit bias on a national debate? Sociology win! #debatenight
#DonaldTrump "We need Law and Order". O PLEASE! Let's bring up #Trump's pending law suits, Hillary!!! #debatenight
What I Learned from #HofDebate16  #debatenight  Donald Trump spent more time defending himself instead of clarifying his specific positions.
Uh LESTER?! Obviously racist birthers will heal race relations in America! #debatenight
Wait, wait, wait - Take away the guns?  That's a very Un-Republican thing to say. #debatenight
.@realDonaldTrump says "you don't learn all that much from tax returns." What do you think?Join us for our #debatenight post debate show.
Ugh she's still talking now it's guns. #debatenight 30 years #Hillary 30 years you could've done something
Why does @realDonaldTrump not smile more? And was that tie really a good choice? #debatenight
Lol they sued me but they also sued a lot of people. Also, I settled and didn't admit guilt. No, that's not cool Drumpf. #debatenight
Trump is on drugs or freaking crazy.  "He has a winning temperament."  #debatenight
The MSM will see this DESTRUCTION of Trump by Hillary as a "tie". #Debates2016
Hillary please confront Trump on extorting money from our allies. This idea has to stop. #noNATOextortion #debates #debatenight
Stop Donald, stop. Are you saying you are using a nuke? You are word salading something too important. #debates #debates2016
Trump is no role model - his views on women &amp; minorities will undo years of progress #debates #debatenight
"I've common sense" - Donald. PolitiFact rates it "Pants on Fire". #debatenight
"Let me give you an example of people who love me." --Trump #Debates2016
Trumped up trickle down is not going to fly as a catch phrase.  #debatenight
Fun Fact: the head chef of Trump's DC hotel "on Pennsylvania Avenue" quit over Trump's racist comments.  #debates #debatenight
"The birth certificate was produced in 2011. You continued to claim otherwise in 2012, 13, 14, 15, and January." -- Lester Holt  #debates
Friends who have flown in from developing nations... how are the airports? #Debates2016 #factcheck
HRC is vulnerable on the cybersecurity issue given her "extreme carelessness  w/her own emails. Trump also vulnerable on Russia.#Debates2016
Dang, now @realDonaldTrump more or less saying he didn't pay someone for work (b/c he might not have been satisfied w/ it). #debatenight
It sounds like @HillaryClinton is saying the same thing every other president has said before her unfortunately #debatenight
@realDonaldTrump talkin' to Hillary like she just built him something and wants to get paid #debatenight
Raising taxes won't work either, especially if you increase government spending☕️🐸 #debatenight #PresidentialDebate
LMAO Trump: "It could be Russia, it could be China, it could be someone over 400 lbs sitting on their bed." Poor neckbeards. #debatenight
Jesus Trump my little son could do better with no prep - "law and order, our inner cities are dangerous" #debates #Debates2016 #debatenight
The 1970's lawsuit was brought up and daddy settled it with no admission of guilt! #debatenight #Debates2016
This audience is not listening to the no cheering thing LOL #debatenight
Who's better on the computer, Trump's 10 year old or the 400 pound hacker? #debatenight
I keep thinking Trump's winning, but he's also kinda acting like a clown so idk... #debatenight
So the Libya is next? Lets get another Muslim state because #ISIS is there too. #debatenight
Hillary's nervous laugh when discussing serious issues coneys her "can't be touched" attitude. #debates is this not serious enough for you?
#Debates2016 too many personal potshots being taken, was it supposed to be this way, shouldn't it be more about the people and the country
#Debates2016*whew* Glad it's the blustering, thin-skinned Trump and not the "under no circumstances should you appear to be bullying" Trump
This debate has been worth every minute.  Great articulation by Hillary Clinton and exceptional self praise by Donald Trump.  #debatenight
This debate is like when me and my girl drink way too much Jack Daniels #debatenight
"African-Americans and Hispanics are living in hell." - Donald Trump Cool story. #debatenight
Donald Trump just because you say "believe me" doesn't mean you're speaking the truth  #debatenight
"We should have taken the oil" yes please just barrel it all up and bring it over here like it works like that #debates #debatenight
Did Lester Holt group the Orlando night club shooting as an ISIS attack?  #Debates2016
Donald, you got a TV show because you temperament was so shitty.  Dude. No.  #Debates2016
Come on Hillary make us proud and keep your amazing strength up against "the Donald" #debates
"you don't learn a lot from tax returns." hmmm... who filed for bankruptcy for his companies 4 times?? 🤔 #debatenight
You know its a bad year for politics when #debatenight is more comedic than it is educational.
I almost admire how much of a cunt Trump is... he doesn't give a fuck! #debatenight
How did she prepare to be President? What does that even mean?? #debatenight
And now the article over a year AFTER the war started, he's claiming that he was against the war #BS #debatenight
Imagine this kind of temperament in a room full of world leaders. Imagine that.  #debatenight
The Hofstra audience openly laughing at Tr--p claiming he has a better temperament than Clinton is my everything. #debates
What's @realDonaldTrump hiding? If you don't contribute, you don't get to govern. Come on Americans! #debatenight #ImWithHer @HillaryClinton
Law and order was a good show, is that still on? #debatenight
Under budget cuz you under pay &amp; won't slow your employees to organize. #Debates
Donald Trump just claimed he has common sense. Fact checkers should be all over that statement. #debatenight #debates #Debates2016
Someone needs to spank Trump so he might shut the fack up #Debates2016
She is gloating because she know she got him by his balls now #DebateNight
The lying marionette in the red pants suit is driving me crazy! 33k emails and Americans died. Watch 13 hours then decide. #debatenight
Yesss Hillary. Please remind him that the #NMAAHC opened this weekend to prove our culture is not just death. Smh #DebateNight #Debates2016
All the trash coming from Trump is gross enough, but Stop and Frisk has to be the most rancid I've ever heard. #debatenight
DT has famously been against the Iraq war - HC get your facts straight #debatenight
Am I the only one waiting to hear.. And the Iraq's.. like Miss Teen USA #debatenight
I've been to Palm Beach.  It is not a "tough community."  #Debates2016 #FactCheckTheDebate
#debates *Everything* is "unbelievable" to Trump. I guess he doesn't get out much.
Trump seems to breathing a little heavy. I wonder how many conspiracies will rise up about his health? #debatenight
"I prepared to be President, and I think that's a good thing." MIC. DROP. @HillaryClinton #ImWithHer #debatenight
Well, Trump didn't go with his red power tie, but he stuck with his white power rhetoric. #debates
@HillaryClinton  implicit bias is a problem for EVERYONE. The problem is police are in a place of power. YES CLINTON! #debatenight
what kills me the most is that republicans will genuinely think trump did great. at least democrats can admit hillary ain't shit! #debates
Stop and frisk? Because I don't have to worry about my husband being racially profiled enough already #debates
Seems Trump's sniffling problem escalates when he feels a panic attack coming on after a @HillaryClinton burn. #debatenight
Wow. Trump brought a feather to a knife fight. Clinton is mopping the floor with him. Not even close. #Debates2016
"Murders are down." -@HillaryClinton  "You're wrong, murders are up." -@realDonaldTrump  "I'm not" -#Clinton The state of politics #debates
"I have a much better temperament than [@HillaryClinton] has." -@realDonaldTrump  Well he's drawing my attention, so sure. #debates
Super dumb. Her emails have nothing to do with your taxes #debatenight #debates
I don't want a president in the WH that's $600m in debt #debatenight #debates
Bill Clinton was a member of an all-White country club. Hello. #debatenight
Tuned in to this dogfight 󾇘 #presidentialdebate #voteGaryJohnson — watching Presidential Debates 2016
This has been going on for over an hour and there's been no nuance #debatenight
Uh oh, a mention of "mainstream media" take a drink  #Debates
I am SO GLAD that criminal justice reform is actually being addressed on national television, esp. in relation to race #debatenight
It really sucks that Clinton is debating like an adult and Trump is whining like a petulant child #debatenight
Love that Trump starts with "I haven't give a lot of thought to this..." Dude, we know #debatenight
Would it be fair for one of the candidates to mention that the media is feeding the fire that is the racial divide? #Debates2016
Does Trump even have speaking points ? His paper probably has scribble on it #debatenight
Did he just invoke Douglas MacArthur?  How does ISIL relate to taxes? I am not for an increase in my taxes tho #fairandbalance #debates2016
how are citizens supposed to respect law enforcement when cops are getting a slap on the wrist for murdering innocent ppl?! #Debates2016
I was fat in middle school. Does that mean I was a hacker then. Is your son fat. Is he a hacker. #debates
Lester Holt appears to be a really good guy, and he is an excellent host for Dateline, but Trump is taking the #debates out of his control.
“I have much better judgment than she does. I also have much better temperament…my best asset is my temperament.” – Trump #debates
Hillary showing why she's the one with the right temperament to be President. #Debates #Debates2016 #DebateNight #ImWithHer
#Trump: We could have rebuilt the country 3x's over with the $ from Iraq; #HillaryClinton: Or maybe if u paid any fed income taxes #debates
Lester Holt is doing a better job moderating the audience than he is moderating the actual candidates. #Debates
#debatenight #debates does Hillary Clinton have parkinsons? She shakes a little and talks very slow. Is she sick?
Lester Holt says Stop and Frisk is unconstitutional - Donald says it is not-  #debatenight #debates
Implicit bias is not just with the police- mental health is a big concern - @HillaryClinton #debatenight #debates
"I settled my justice department issues with no admission of guilt" - @realDonaldTrump  pay it away! dolla bills y'all #debates #debatenight
So @HillaryClinton thinks cyber security is an important issue? Can't imagine why... #Debates2016 #DebateNight #CrookedHillary
Trump is not making any sense.  It's a just repetition of the same stuff #debatenight
Absolutely historic to have a woman on this stage for the first time ever, proud to support @HillaryClinton #ImWithHer #Debates2016
My blood is boiling @ the stop &amp; frisk argument. Trump, you don't understand the psychological implications, so stop. Please. #debatenight
my respect for @HillaryClinton is going way up. she has to put up with this horse hockey #debatenight
Woah. "Braggadocious" might be the only thing I take from anything Trump says tonight. #debatenight
Oh God, Trump supporters retweeting me thinking I agree with them. Trump is a fascist scumbag #debatenight
God bless Hilary Clinton for dealing with Trumps outbursts during her time. So composed 👏🏼👏🏼#debatenight
Oh my god. Are you kidding me? STOP TALKING OVER HER WITH  YOUR LOUD NONSENSE. #Debates2016 #debatenight #ImWithHer
Who needs a Cabinet? Apparently Sean Hannity is thr absolute expert on international relations. #debatenight
Nobody with any intellectual credibility in the ENTIRE WORLD wants Trump to win. #debatenight #debates #Debates2016
Who else is sick to death of hearing Trump blabber on about who has endorsed him!? Just answer the bloody question! #debatenight
Okay @HillaryClinton this is all speculation... this is useless information to talk about, let's get into real issues #Debates2016
Muslims make up about 1 percent of the total US population. 1 percent. #PresidentialDebate #DebateNight2016 #DebateNight
Donald Trump really said the entire country needs stop and frisk? Like really #PresidentialDebate #Debates2016
Problem with no fly list they put 2 year olds on it and never taken them off... #debatenight #debates
"They talk good around election time, like right now--" (Proceeds to talk poorly).  #debatenight #bigly
Did trump just fucking ridicule overweight people wooooooow good fucking example for our country #debatenight
Trump stared directly into the camera at one point in the debate and I could feel my soul slowly crumpling into dust #debatenight
"I prepared to be President. And I think that's a good thing." YES. #DebateNight
Keep the government out of my healthcare!  Drs &amp; patients #MyDoctorKnowsBest #Debates
#debatenight pay for protection? We trade weapons for oil to Saudi Arabia. Omg this just goes to show you how stupid republicans are
Why didn't I take the #Debates2016 drinking game more seriously and prepare?
So a guy who discriminates against nearly everyone is a solution and not a problem? But emails are a deal breaker? 💀 #debatenight
Oh and Gulliani was a nut bag...NY couldn't wait to get rid of him #debatenight
Did  @realDonaldTrump just posit a first-strike scenario and then disavow such a scenario or strategy?#debate2016 #debatenight
#debates Trump said he knows how to defeat ISIS more than the generals. and then he beats on HC about her plan on website. Go fig.
Email thing is an issue, but didn't cause any damage and was the same setup as Colin Powell and approved by POTUS #debatenight
@thelindywest You know how interrupting cow goes moo? That's the sound interrupting Trump makes #debatenight
Why can't Trump finish a complete sentence? He even interrupts himself. #debatenight
#debatenight Trump's "Financial Disclosure" = BS b/c penalty for lying on that VS tax returns can be imprisonment, tax returns don't lie.
.@LesterHoltNBC should stick to @DatelineNBC stories. Not impressed with how he is handling this debacle. #debates
Trump made almost 700 million last year. #Trump filed bankruptcy when Bush was president. #thanksobama #debates2016
@realDonaldTrump not denying waiting 4 extra years after Obama's birth cert verification.  #Debates2016 #racism #thatmakesmesmart
I do not want to play poker with @realDonaldTrump. He's got a good bluff face.  #debatenight
Lmao y'all really falling for Hilary's "I got black ppls back" bullshit. Can't relate. Receipts, actions, &amp; history say otherwise. #Debates
If I don't get to Penn Ave one way I'll get there another #debatenight
"You shouldn't have a profit motivation to fill prison cells" -Hillary #debatenight
Omg, do people really love him? How is that even possible? 🤔🤔🤔 #debatenight
Trump is falling apart. Trump doesn't know ANYTHING about foreign policy. #debates
Everyone agrees or infrastructure is garbage. He's smart to move to this. #debatenight
Sorry, not sorry I agree with Trump stop and frisk was a good thing  #debatenight
An aside, the first seven presidents would not have had American birth certificates. #debatenight
@HillaryClinton gets points with explaning trickle down economics. Trump voters are less educated and they need the information. #Debates
I prepared to be president and i think thats a good thing- Clinton #debatenight #debate2016
@JulieSnook only thing you should learn is NOT to vote for @realDonaldTrump. He is a criminal tax dodger #debatenight
DJ looks like a lumpy pumpkin pie with fried hair on top #Burn #debates #debatenight
Less than an hour into it and Trump has already proved himself a bigot, self-interested and an idiot. #Debates2016
I love the man with the Gold 24k toilet is telling the world that America is a third world country. Get a grip you whiny bitch. #debates
Trump is finding it really hard to stay on subject. This rambling is getting a bit chaotic now #debatenight
"#implicitbias is a problem for all of us, not just police" @HillaryClinton yes! This is a leader I can follow. #debatenight
Y'all say what ever y'all want, but Hillary looks nice in red. #debates
This is unlistenable. A clear, intelligent, thoughtful woman and a blithering idiot terrified child on repeat #Debates2016
The reason I don't release my tax returns is simple. I don't want to. #debatenight
It's like debating a toddler. Wrong. Wrong. Wrong. Poor grammar. And worthy of a time out. #debatenight
Trump is avoiding his tax returns with these emails cause he's hiding something obviously  #debates
@realDonaldTrump says he has a better temperament than @HillaryClinton and the audience literally LOLs. #Debates2016 #DumpTrump
Lester need to go up there and let trump catch them hands #debates
He's tripping over his words about tax returns. Yeah...THIS is the guy who should be in charge of fighting ISIS. #debates Except not really.
But the IRS isn't stopping you from releasing your tax returns so what the fuck is the problem? #Debates
A woman only gets 70 seconds on the clock for each 100 seconds a man gets. #Debates2016
#debates. No other president birth has ever been questioned...why President Obama? mmmm because he's black!
"I will release my tax returns against my lawyer's wishes when she releases her 33,000 emails."-@realDonaldTrump @HillaryClinton #debates
.@realDonaldTrump claims he has better temperament than @HillaryClinton. Says he has a "winning temperament". What do you think? #debates
A tremendous job. It'll be the greatest job ever. The tremendousest. #Debates2016
@realDonaldTrump cannot answer any question that starts with "how"! Tonight, we're all losing #debatenight #cbsnreax
Donald hasn´t a good reputation but actually he says some good things and clinton sounds like a socialist and this is really creepy #debates
#DebateNight Obama's golfing, Hillary sleeping for 30 years. Yeah he is doing it. 30 mins passed and Trump is winning the first debate!
What kind of yoga is Hillary practicing? So calm. So centered. #debatenight
You have to hand it to Hillary. That new computer program makes her seems almost like a real human. Impressive!  #debates
Retired people who play golf on golf courses can't be trusted. Obama! #Debates2016
Confirmed: loser of debate 1 will fight Cm punk in New York #debatenight
RT BernieSanders: This is crazy. After trying to delegitimize Obama's presidency now Trump says he did the country a favor. #debatenight
@realDonaldTrump  Tonight, a bloated scrutum with a bad tan &amp; a bad wig, digs himself a hole with his mouth. #debates2016
#Trump: "I'll release my tax return when #Hillary releases the 33,000 deleted emails." #DebateNight #fdrlst
Have to say Hillary came in prepared for this debate. Trump seems like he's just been thrown in there #Debates
Bragging about how much you allegedly made wont ingratiate U to someone on foodstamps, #TrumpTaxEvasion #debatenight
Yes Trump, we know you have a lot of money. Please stop telling us you have money. #debatenight
Ut oh, @realDonaldTrump brought up the birth certificate issue. Should be interesting #debatenight
You know what else I prepared for? Being President. And I think that's a good thing. ~@HillaryClinton #debatenight
#Trump is just embarrassing himself at this point..... zone candidate is playing Chess the other is playing this dog shit #debatenight
'...cyber is one of them'. thanks don. save us from the internets #debatenight
"When he goes off onto the golf course...to play golf" thank god you cleared that up, because I was definitely confused. #debatenight
#debatenight Very true, our roads are shit. Road construction for 10 years.
Trump is ripping Hillary on simple debate technique, she needs to give him the ball and then counter punch. Not vice versa #Debates
Clinton on Trump: He has said repeatedly that he didn't care if other nations got nuclear weapons #PresidentialDebate #debatenight
So the debates are happening between my two least favorite Politicians. Not very excited for the future.
Do you only love things you invest in, Donald? INVEST IN ME. #debatenight
Very courageous for @HillaryClinton to admit her mistakes and apologize. @theDonaldTrump, the only disgrace here is you. #debates
RT KVUE #foxaustin "RT MarkW_KVUE: Trump telling Clinton he prepared for debates by watching her debate Obama: "When you try to act holier …
RT KVUE #foxaustin "Clinton: "We are seeing cyber attacks coming from states, organs of states." Notes Russian cyber attacks. #debatenight"
First time @HowardStern has ever been brought up in a presidential debate! #debatenight
The no fly list thing was an incredibly stupid for Trump to cave in for #debatenight
Why no US flag pin on Hillary Clinton? Wardrobe choices interesting: Blue tie on Republican candidate, red outfit on Democrat. #Debates2016
"How will you build bridges between communities? " - Answer: " We will stop and frisk!" #igiveup #debates
@patmayo Isn't it amazing they can email and tweet WHILE standing behind a podium?  #debatenight
Clinton's answer to "heal the divide" Military weapons leave police "outgunned" Overcome "implicit bias" Retrain police #debatenight
I still blame that youtube video guy  for  benghazi #debatenight
@taffyakner  what word are you talking about? I can name three he mispronounced in the past three minutes. #Debates2016
Watching the debate and Monday night football. Guess which ones more entertaining?  #Debates
WHY THE FUCK IS IT RELEVANT THAT OBAMA IS FROM CHICAGO?!?!?! #debates #debatenight
#debatenight omg Trump is digging his presidential grave and Hilary just smiling about it.
She doesn't have to do anything but let him rant and make himself look unpresidential.  He has not effectively attacked her yet#Debates2016
Why is it that when Trump says "Believe me," I don't?  #debates
"@GroseAndrew: Well Trump just lost the 400 pound hacker on a couch vote. #debatenight"do they vote?
Wait....who's out of control, Donald? Jesus. Yeah, hand him the launch codes tomorrow. He got the temper of a kindergartner. #debatenight
Describe #trump and #hillary in one word tonight. Nonverbally #hillary = smug #trump = irritated. Thoughts? #Debates2016
What are you hiding, Trump, on your tax returns? Audits for 15 years doesn't mean you need to keep hiding your numbers #debates
Trump stiffing workers on his projects - probably the only thing that's stiff in his life #debates
Tens of thousands who love Trump - must be all of those workers who make his garments in China #debates
"I have a much better temperament than she has." Holy effin' hell. I'm done. This is just. Ugh. #Debates2016
Dude, clinton is much more of a leader than #OrangeVoldemort will ever be. She learns from her mistakes. He doesn't from his! #Debates2016
Glad @realDonaldTrump is making peace his Pennsylvania Ave Hotel is as close to the @WhiteHouse as he'll ever get. #Sniffles 😥 #debatenight
i feel so bad for hillary bc she has to repress her laughter 😂 #debatenight
"I don't believe global warming like you and your lackey of... What are they called? Scientists." #debatenight
God I should have turned this debate off the minute he asked the race question #debates
Patiently waiting for one of them to jump the podium &amp; body slam the other. #Debates2016
I, too, will now refer to it as "the security aspect of cyber." #Debates2016
Lester Holt brought this up so Hillary could lie. Hillary started the birther issue. #debates2016
I'm disgusted by the way this man communicates. He doesn't take ownership, complains, &amp; takes low blows. No soul whatsoever #Debates2016
"Clinton has been fighting ISIS her entire adult life, which if you think about it is a compliment about how young she looks," #debates
How hard is it to demand iMr. Trump please answer the question! #Debates
I don't live in America, but watching this debate I actually forget these two are competing to become President #Debates
Donald Trump hair is remaining still, where is all that pressure being directed? #Debates
I feel like a life of trying psychedelic drugs was just preparation for trying to understand USA 2016 #Debates2016
#Trump says he will release his tax returns when #Hillary releases the 33,000 #Emails she deleted. #debatenight
Debating with Donald Trump is like having an argument with a sugared up 12 year old.  #debatenight
Accurate coverage is unusual for my beloved @nytimes???? I need an update! @realDonaldTrump @HillaryClinton #FactCheckTheDebate #debatenight
Trump: The DNC hack could have been perpetrated by someone weighing 400 lbs sitting on their bed.  ???  #debates
Watching the #Debates2016 and I only see an angry kid against the future President of United States.
#Debates2016 if you're gonna mention #HowardStern you should at least slip in a bababooey.
Trump will bring back the birther thing when Obama tries to apply for a Blockbuster Video card. #aretheystillathing #debates
Guys, is it my tv, or does he look less orange tonight? #debatenight
#debatenight #debates i figured guys everyone vote for clinton so she can die in office before her 3rd year
@realDonaldTrump needs to calm down and bring his personable side to the table. #debates Too attacking. Hillary has her game face on.
im suffering from secondhand embarrassment... this is so hard to watch... #debatenight.
Who better to lecture us about law and order than a career grifter and fraudster and tax cheat? #debatenight
I'm not sure how many times I can yell "shut up" at Donald while Hillary is supposed to be talking #debatenight #PresidentialDebate
I want to hear the words "Monica Lewinsky" come out of Donald Trump's mouth. #debatenight
I'm listening to the #Debates2016 in the other room, and "you know who* sounds like he's completely lost it!
I guarantee you every politician has done what Hillary may or may not have done with email, whether they realize it or not. #debatenight
Hillary like a history teacher to a student who just failed his exam  #debatenight
Suggests "stop &amp; frisk" as a solution while the issue police brutality &amp; profiling is on the table....#DebateNight
#Debates Can't wait to hear Trump say "Blacks and Latinos LOVE me" ... Oh wait, I should let the man have his turn ...
Trump's America: inner cities &amp; airports are like the 3rd world, all leaders are incompetent. Russia &amp; China are praiseworthy. #debatenight
"No admission of guilt" is not "no admission of wrong doing" #Debates2016
Uh goofy why in the Ham Sandwich are you talking about??? #Debates
"I prepared for the debate &amp; prepared to be President!" Translation: 'It's my turn. It's my turn! It's MY turn!' #debates
So...it's OK to rip people off as long as you don't get in trouble? #debates2016
Um Trump since you seem to be doing improv throughout this debate you should follow the rules. You can't say no  #debatenight
"I love Charlotte, I have investments there"... "I love Chicago I have businesses there" .. uhh great info 👍🏻 #Debates2016
Hey Donald sorry to break the news to you but the word "Wrong" does not function as a time machine. #debatenight
It is official the only candidate that supports the  right to bear arms is @GovGaryJohnson !!! @NRA  #LetGaryDebate #debates #2ndAmendment
You don't do well for your companies @realDonaldTrump, you run them and the people that work for you into the ground #debatenight
Woah woah, caliphate? Careful Hillary, let's keep this at a first grade vocabulary level for tiny hands #debatenight
"It's all words. It's all sound bites..." No! They're facts! 🙈🙆🏻🙊 #DebateNight #ImWithHer
Don't argue politics with me if you aren't even registered to vote #debates2016
Better temperament? #blesshisheart He doesn't even have the temperament to follow his own plan of not acting like a dick. #debatenight
It took a hack of the DNC for Hillary to view Russia as a threat. #Debates2016
"Just listen to what you've heard." This is literally what every Trump supporter needs to do. Like, REALLY do. #debatenight
Yes, Hillary. We need to give ISIS a Care Bear stare! #debatenight
He's trying SO hard not to call her Crooked Hillary right now. Almost slipped. #debatenight
Soooo Holt just said the IRS told him you're free to release them. #Debates2016
Why are we talking about airports? The US is no 3rd world country lmao. Has Donald ever been to a third world country #debatenight
"Maybe if you paid your taxes..." most amazeballs comment by @HillaryClinton this evening. @realDonaldTrump looking flustered. #debatenight
@realDonaldTrump : "We're in a big fat ugly bubble." Takes 1 to know 1. #Debates2016 #boyinabubble
When asked about race relations, trump again mentions his birther argument and how he moved past it #debatenight
It's like watching mom and dad fight over who gets the you in the divorce. #debatenight
Stop and Frisk did have a tremendous impact. A negative one. #debatenight
Trump says "temperament" like it was today's Word of the Day. #debates
Hillary is laughing because she knows how stupid and idiotic trump sounds right now lmao #ImWithHer #debatenight
TRUMP IS CHOKING LMAOOOOOOOO HE SUPPORTED THE WAR COME ON NOW STOPP AVOIDINGG IT PLEASE !!!!! #debatenight
not all illegal immigrants are the ones in the gangs ? #debatenight
Let's face it, There's an offensive lack of gold fixtures in our airports and it's bringing our nation down. #Debates2016 #DebateNight
i'm the only person not watching the debates and i'm okay with not losing any brain cells
I hope this election is in the history books  so that our children never make this mistake again. #Debates
@liamlahey Funny you mention SNL. Clinton’s opening to the birther response reminded me of the SNL Bush/Dukakis debate skit. #debatenight
Broad-based inclusive growth is what America needs, not more advantage for people at the top, says @HillaryClinton #debatenight
"You know what else I prepared for? I prepared to be president".- @HillaryClinton 👏🏼👏🏼🙌🏼 #DebateNight #ImWithHer
"You decided to stay home and that's ok" *audible gasp*  #Debates
I suddenly have the urge to give Hillary Clinton a bunch of high fives. #Debates2016
@HillaryClinton slowing down. Running out of energy. Defib only kicked in twice. BP now 160 over 95.  #DebateNight
Donald, just because you say the same thing 3 times, that doesn't make it true. #Debates #debatenight
Be sure to continue to remind us all the places you have investments or as I like to call them, future bankruptcies #debatenight
I can't believe this is real life. One of these people will be our next president. #debates2016
YOU GOT HIM TO "PRODUCE THE BIRTH CERTIFICATE" BECAUSE YOU THOUGHT THE AMERICAN PRESIDENT WAS NOT BORN IN THE USA #debatenight
"No admission of guilt" does not mean innocent of racist housing practices. #debatenight

If he's so great at running his companies why hasn't he been paying his taxes? #Debates2016
#debates? Nah, fam. I'm voting for Trump because he's the lesser of two evils.
So, you racially profiled...and you're proud of it. Seriously SHUT UP #debatenight
I appreciate that Hillary is addressing what she's done wrong re: blacks and the criminal justice #debatenight

Ever hear a presidential candidate say "big, fat, ugly" in order like that? I thought not. #debatenight
Hillary did a totally 360 from when her husband was in office #debatenight

Trump: "They're not bringing their money back into our country because of the red tape." #debatenight
what has Trump said that he will do??  Did I miss it? #debates
One hour in and and I am interested who has jumped off that sinking ship called the Trump Campaign? #titanic #debates
#debatenight I DONT THINK I CAN STAND CLINTON'S SMIRKY FACE AND SMART MOUTH LYING ALL NIGHT‼️SHE MAKES ME SICK‼️CANT BELIEVE ONE WORD‼️
Trump giving Clinton the evil eye while drinking his water  #debates
Wasn't the question "how" will you deal with cyber war? Donald? How exactly will you fight this? #debatenight
The smart, sensible conversation these two could have had if they weren't politicians. #debates
Too dangerous to fly, you are too dangerous to buy a gun. #watchlist  #debatenight  #debatenight2016
Basically what Trump just said was "a friend of a friend who has this cousin who had a friend who's a reporter...." #debatenight #debates
#debatenight She just sounds like a politician. I think people are tired of that.
@realDonaldTrump developed "a very good relationship" w/ "the African Americans"-Good thing he wrapped the whole birther thing #debatenight
#Debates2016 @realDonaldTrump keep making faces bc you have no clue about constitutional rights
What the fuck is on about paying? Is America now Bodyguard to the world?  #Debates
The only thing I agree with Hillary on so far is her addressing of #MentalHealth. Don't see that in many debates. #Debates2016
Trump talks about Hillary like he talks about his tax plan: sounds great, never going to happen. #Debates2016 #DebateNight #DacidDorerShow
in #debates @realDonaldTrump admits he hasn't paid any taxes; @HillaryClinton now detailing how he defrauding so many people
Remember, all these large inner cities with huge problems have been run by Democrats for decades #Debates2016
"We are in a big, fat, ugly bubble." There goes Donald talking about himself again. #debatenight
It's sad to see how downhill our country is going.. no matter who wins this election. #debatenight
I feel sick.  Maybe applying for a work visa in Canada will make me feel better #Debates
Lets see what donald ignorant self gonna say bout race relations #debatenight #thePresidentialDebate
Trump does not respect time... or others.  He has no self-control! #rambling #debatenight
@debates...Would somebody give Lester a gavel to throw at Trumps head...please shut him up!
Trump is for stop and frisk. You know, that unconstitutional and illegal policy that isn't used anymore. #debatenight #PresidentialDebate
Donald talking to white people using code words like stop &amp; frisk, law &amp; order....he doesn't care about POC or racism. #Debates2016
Here's the reality: Donald Trump hasn't lost this debate, yet. Which means he is winning. #debatenight
Less taxes and emails and more debating please!!! Undecided let's listen to them all! #WhereIsGary  #debatenight #LetGaryDebate @debates
Trumps response to healing race divide "We need law and order." #Debates2016
@CNNPolitics what is going on with Trump #debates can't understand not thing with the constant sniffling while he speaking.
#debatenight Trump is a lunatic and a bully. Uneducated misogynistic bigots can’t believe someone is finally speaking to them
He’s just making up all of these names on the birther thing, right? #debatenight
"The argument is not that the policy is unconstitutional...we need stop and frisk...there's some bad things going on" #debatenight

Trumps temperament is good? WTF .. He is just cray and delusional and a LIAR #Debates2016
I feel like I'm at a dinner party with a crazy guy who has no idea what he's taking about #Debates2016
Hillary called young black men “super-predators” indicating that she thought all young black males were violent criminals. #debatenight
When is the child going to shout " He's got no clothes!" ? #Debates2016
What a cunt. Trump just tried to blame Obama and immigrants. #debatenight
So confused...The Republican candidate wants to take away guns. I thought Obama wanted my guns? #stopandfrisk #unconstitutional #debatenight
Trump DID NOT just defend stop &amp; frisk did he? OH YES HE DID. Deplorable. #debatenight #Trump is unfit to lead. #GoHillary #HillaryClinton
Trump: "I have a much better temperament than her" the audience laughs #debatenight #Debates2016
How the hell are you going to remove guns?! Dumbest comment ever. #Debates
"That's not a lot of money..." to #Trump, but I'll be happy with 1/4 of it! #perspective #debatenight

"We need to move on" - Lester Holt greatest line I've heard all night. #debatenight
#Debates2016 "Will you release your tax returns?"  "THAT'S THE TYPE OF THINKING THIS COUNTRY NEEDS!!!"  Huh?
Wait, did Barack Obama shoot 4,000 people in Chicago, or did I misunderstand @realDonaldTrump? #Debates2016
I am loving this stop mid-sentence argumentative pivoting. haven't seen that since I fought someone for gushers in kindergarten#Debates2016
She prepared for the debate and she prepared for the presidency. #debates.
Sorry, did he just say "I haven't given lots of thought to NATO"??!!!  #debatenight
I. Have. Property. There. This is seriously what he is worried about. #Debates2016
With no taxes, all of these new buildings and infrastructure will come from where?? Private industry with no regulation?? #debatenight
I was wondering if the moderator was still there for a minute... #Debates2016
HC the deaths you caused can never be put to bed. HC fine one to talk about careers?  Is she still talking three minutes?  LESTER #Debates
@realDonaldTrump is a tax evader ! That is why you Will never see his taxes returns ! #Debates2016 #debatenight
I think he just said our country shouldn't honor its contracts the same way he doesn't. #debatenight
"No, you're wrong." Yeah, @realDonaldTrump, please contradict an educated moderator. Please. I beg you. #debatenight #celect16
TRUMP on Clinton's email scandal: That wasn't a mistake, that was on purpose. #JOUR3001 #Debates2016

#debatenight Donald Trump looks like a parakeet looking at itself in a mirror
#debatenight I am so sick of politicians like clinton lie to the american people.  She is such a fraud.
Why is Hillary talking so slow? Ya only got 2 minutes to say what ya can... she's like a robot talking #debatenight
@realDonaldTrump will need a @Chiropractor if he keeps his neck twisted like this. #debatenight
Wow Trump should be an English teacher with all that irony he's displaying tonight #debatenight
Lost control of things since Obama has been in office or technology has advanced to an entire new level? #debatenight
If you're not furious about the condition of this country, you're not paying attention. GO TRUMP GO!! #DebateNight
@realDonaldTrump needs to stick with filing bankruptcy and rotting meat and leave government to the smart people #debatenight
Donald just ignored every single credible climate change scientist in the world... wow  #comdeb #debatenight
The worst thing is that this clown does not deserve to be on the same stage as HRC. It's beneath her.#debatenight
Lester Holt: Uh, stop and frisk is unconstitutional. Donald: You're wrong. It went before a judge who was "a very police judge." #Debates
Hilary can taste the presidency. Donald is trying his best to smell it. #debatenight
Why put Hilary in the white house? She's gonna have a heart attack in her first week from all the stress. She can't handle it. #Debates
.@realDonaldTrump 'We need better relationships between the community and the police... Look at Dallas' #backtheblue #debatenight
I c ur facts lester and raise you some utter bullish! #debates2016
"let's talk about the question you asked, lester." oh yes, let's! 🙄 #Debates2016
Whether you agree with someone or not talking over them over multiple times is rude and childish. #debatenight
I legit thought Trump said he was endorsed by Isis. Am I the only one??? #debatenight
Just got to gun control. how do you prevent a bad guy from getting a gun? The black market is still a thing. #Debates
Can we talk about temperament? I wanna talk about temperament.  PLEEASE talk about temperament.  #debatenight
"You can release your returns during an audit." - moderator "I will AFTER THE AUDIT!" - Trump. #Debates2016
Yeah it was a bad idea to drink coffee right before this... #debates
wait. donald trump is 70-years-old and has a 10-year-old son? 😳  #debatenight
Yes, let's take the guns because they shoot themselves 🙄I can't deal with how stupid she is #SitDownHillary #DebateNight

So who thinks Mickey Mouse should become president?! The world would be a happier place🤓 #DebateNight #justsayin 🤔😂
Ah so the moderator is for the audience. The fact checking debate makes a lot more sense now #debatenight
I can't wait to see SNL do a sketch on this #DebateNight
@realDonaldTrump Don't you have Christie on your campaign staff? You were pretty mean to him during the debates! So... Yeah. #ImWithHer
#debates Doesn't look like we didn't get a neutral moderator! So sad!
@HillaryClinton has yet to interrupt @realDonaldTrump, this is what a grown up looks like, folks. #DebateNight #PresidentialDebate
Its not about gun control laws its about JUSTICE so stop trying to bring up gun laws ☕️ #debatenight
If there is nothing in the tax returns, why not release them? #Debates2016
Oh lord, @HillaryClinton to call the birther topic racist is just plain stupid and inflammatory #Debates2016
When Sean Babbitt is your character witness, you have a problem. #debatenight
Oh snap. Now Trump is pivoting to Obama being the founder of ISIS #debates
Hillary: "You know what else I've been preparing for? To be president." *silence* #Damn #DebateNight
Annnnd the audit excuse. Really wearing thin, when you see how many years worth of tax returns the Clintons have released. #debatenight
DJT traveled to met voters and prepared for the debate. HRC could only prepare for the debate. Enough said. #Debates2016 #FoxNews #Debates
Nobody calls Sean Hannity! Well, he's going to win with that argument. #Trump #debatenight
The phrase "trickle down" always reminds me of a gutter. You know what else is in the gutter... THIS DEBATE #Debates2016
Trump: "it could be someone sitting on their bed who weighs 400 pounds". Wow. Now he's discriminating against overweight people. #debates
#debatenight normally I really hate comedy shows but I like this one. Such a clown fiesta.
Half of Americans can't afford a $400 emergency. More unregulated banks and corporate tax cuts aren't a solution for them. #debatenight
Trump's stop and frisk is a license to harass young people of color. Oh, and it's unconstitutional. #debatenight
DrJillStein: Peace and security are not just the absence of violence, they are the presence of justice. -MLK #debates #OccupyTheDebates
Trump proposing stop and frisk is atrocious, I mean god damn, way to lose any semblance of minority voters you once had #debatenight
I am so tired of hearing his accomplishments. Would like to hear more about specific policy details. #debatenight
Trumps hand went into frame and I was like damn it is small. #debatenight
Our airports are like third-world countries? Pretty sure I can't visit a luxury lounge, bar, and gift shops in one. #DebateNight
How are we going to help the racial divide?  Trump: Institute stop and frisk.  Clinton: We need to address system racism.  #DebateNight
I know if this was a court of law who the judge would like, no matter who had the better case. #debates
Trump was too busy fighting the IRS to join in Hillary's decades long crusade against ISIS. Fact. #Debates
@realDonaldTrump - #trump admits he paid no taxes!  He says, "It would be squandered too‼️" #crook #debatenight
i miss the democratic or republican primary debates where there were candidates i actually liked @MrKoleszar #ahsapgov
Trump is publicly advocating for the U.S. to steal of national resources from Iraq? Really?!  #debatenight
The record shows SHUT UP LESTER LEAVE ME ALONE THIS DEBATE IS RIGGED #debates
The sad thing for trump is that he has no idea he has and is being annihilated #debates
Lester is out of his league. He needs to start showing some cards or it's going to really get out of hand in the 2nd half. #debatenight
big fat ugly bubble  oh this one is too easy #debates
There should be a rule to become president, serve at least 4 years in the United States military to avoid clowns like these. #debatenight
I wish I could have a dollar for every time Donald Trump blames something on China #debatenight
Where are the verbs and nouns?? You cannot be president with adjectives alone #Debates2016 #trumpisafool
#debatenight @HillaryClinton talks about stiffing people. What did she do to those 4 men in Benghazi?
Clinton just tied this one up. Pointing out the lunacy of giving Trump control over the nukes is a strong debating tactic. #debatenight
@SansaRising when being challenged about not paying taxes " that makes me smart " ! 😨  #debatenight
Of course he's trying to save ALL the capaign money. How else is he gonna pay his back taxes?!?!? #DebateNight
He reminds me of a snotty teenager with all those faces he makes at the camera. #debatenight #debates
I think a big indicator of how this debate is going is that the audience is laughing at Trump, but with @HillaryClinton #debatenight
As everyone watches the debates tonight, don't forget about @GovGaryJohnson. We need a strong 3rd choice. #LetGaryDebate
Congrats sir, you obtained a birth certificate that LITERALLY no one asked for. #debatenight
Clinton reminding us that Russia is hacking us and Trump is praising Putin #DebateNight #TrumpSoKGB
Just woke up in the middle of the night, watching #debatenight WTF guys
Trump tells truth about birther issue.  Hilly makes smug face. #debatenight #CrookedHillary
Trump ain't said nothing rational about race. All I hear is "my investments, my properties, etc. " Next topic please. #Debates #DebateNight
650 million isn't a lot of money guys, I could barely pay live life with that much. #debatenight
#Debates kk alright hands up @realDonaldTrump maybe we do need a business man like you to get our country out of defeceit. If you could do
#HillaryClinton blames guns for race relations - what the hell is she talking about? It's her constant racebaiting that's to blame #debates
I mean, I was an Obama supporter but I could understand Mitt Romney. What is this mess yall voted for in the primaries GOP? #debatenight
This is a record-breaking debate - the worst debate a child has ever had against a successful professional elder lady. #debatenight
Trump being accused of not paying taxes? "That makes me smart" #dumptrump #debatenight
#Debates If I'm not supposed to care about HRCs emails why should I care about DJT tax returns that don't effect US security ? #MAGA
What if trump uses the Lincoln bedroom as his spray tan room #thinkaboutit #debatenight
@LesterHoltNBC Voters DO NOT CARE ab #birther comment. BUT V CARE V cannot GO 2 PARKS/malls without worrying abt being attacked #debatenight
The orange goober is one fact check against him from loosing his shit. #debatenight #debates #Debates2016 #trumpstrikesagain
I'm amazed @realDonaldTrump kept a straight face after the comment about "inviting Putin". #debate #debatenight
#debatenight is it just me or is #Trump sounding like a full fledged moron?
this is so unprofessional and pathetic our country is doomed yikes #debatenight
And @HillaryClinton gets the entire audience to laugh at @realDonaldTrump AGAIN - M #Debates2016
We need to find something for Donald Trump &amp; Don Cherry to debate. That'd be one of the most mind-numbingly awesome #debates of all time.
I think Trump thinks that if he says 'WRONG' it just erases from people's minds his prior statements. #debatenight
I'm still waiting for trump to tell us, what is he going to do for us?Does he only knows how to cry? #Debates2016 #debates @realDonaldTrump
THIS IS THE MOST BIAS DEBATE IN AMERICAN HISTORY. I DONT CARE WHO THE CANDIDATES ARE THIS IS NOT RIGHT. #debatenight
"All I see is Hillary making excuses while Trump makes solutions" - 11 year old nephew #debates
Debates always exhaust me but being sick during them is worse
@HillaryClinton I bet you're just dying to collapse in a coughing fit of rage. #debatenight #CrookedHillary
I really can't see myself ever genuinely being on the side of either candidate. #debatenight
I've left for 3 seconds and trump was saying the same thing 😂#Debates
Where he has investments , yes because that's what matters 🙈 #Debates
"you know what else i prepared for, i prepared to be president" #GoHillary #debates #debatenight #burn
I'm far from a Trump fan but it never fails to blow my mind that anyone would be stupid enough to vote for @HillaryClinton #debatenight
Ending the AIDS epidemic requires US investment &amp; leadership. Tell the next president to increase @PEPFAR funding. #Debates #EndAIDS
he doesn't like 400 lb people. no. now even the overweight are not his friends and there are a few of them in USA...  #debates
Trump has a special place in his heart for the ppl of Palm Beach #debatenight
Sounds like Trump is promoting Law &amp; Order: SVU not talking about race relations #debatenight
Well Trump just said he was going to help people get off, so.... #debatenight
ion want nobody to become president honestly. Let us be independent for once #debatenight
Trump back for a sweet burn   man this is the best reality tv i've ever seen #Debates
"You know what else I prepared for? I prepared to be president" -Clinton #Debates
#debatenight Just about fell out of my chair - Trump is smashing Killary
He's quiet now. Donald should have answered first so he can't piggyback over Hillary's comment #debatenight
Debates should always be balanced ;) Someone is getting worked up haha! Take it easy #debatenight
Is it just me, or is this debate really dry and the same bull thats been going around?Donald sounds like hes lost a lung. #debates
He’s still trying to pull that audit thing BROCHEETO TRUMPETO THE IRS SAYS YOU CAN RELEASE IT #debatenight
HOLY SHIT  TRUMP JUST SAID IT WAS COOL TO NOT PAY CONTRACTORS ON NATIONAL TV  WTF IS THIS ELECTION  #debates
Also shout out to Gary Johnson for live tweeting his responses. Still doesn't belong at this level but I'm glad to see him #debatenight
#Debates2016 Donald still with his position about the increase of jobs and the elimination of NAFTA.
Watching The Donald debate is like watching a team score own goals for 90 minutes. He's doing all the work for her #debatenight
There is a prohibition on gun ownership by criminals and background checks... What else is she asking for? #debatenight #Debates2016
Hillary and Trump each wearing colors from the opposing party. Attempt to appeal to the other side? Not so subtle. #Debates2016
Trump: "When you try to act holier than thou, it really doesn't work... " @politacs7 #VoteTrump #Debates2016
The man visibly rolled his eyes at the mention of Black culture. #debatenight
@realDonaldTrump just explained why trickle down economics didn't work.  Greedy fuckers not paying a hard workers salary. #debatenight
Did you even watch the #debatenight if you didn't snapfilter their faces?
Hillary was SofS during the formation of ISIS. They're now in 30 countries, but she says she can stop them? I don't think so! #DebateNight
"We lose on everything." Dear Evangelicals, our role is not be the winners. #Debates2016
I want this #debatenight to lead to a hell in a cell match
You think you did a good job. Really that's the best you can come up with? #debatenight #Debates2016
People literally laughed when he said he had a better temperament #Debates2016 #StopTheTrumpTrain #DebateNight
My head is spinning trying to keep up with all the twists and turns of Trump's ramblings..... #debatenight
Hillary has lipstick on her teeth and that's basically all I can pay attention too. #debatenight
Donald Trump does not own any property within a 30 minute limousine drive of where young African American men are shot in Chicago #Debates
I don't care about Trump's taxes or Hillary's emails can we talk about ending crippling student loan debt and legalizing weed #debatenight
What is wrong with this man? Why is he talking about his 10 yo son and cyber security? #debatenight
Trump just said he has not only good temperament, but better than Hillary. BWAHAHA. Now that whopper is disqualifying. 😂😂😂 #debatenight
@realDonaldTrump just said we should take guns away from people who shouldn't have it. #debatenight
Why does he deflect sooo much. We talking ABOUT YOU. What are you going to do??  #debatenight
Let's be clear, stop and frisk is not a solution, it's symbolic of racism in the criminal justice system #Debates2016
Isis wouldn't have been if you idiots hadn't killed Saddam or Gaddafi. #Debates
Lester has his hands full trying to keep L'Orange on topic. #sniff #DebateNight
Well at least we know Lester Holt is a great eavesdropper. #Debates2016
Does Trump just want to live on Pennsylvania Avenue? Is that what this whole thing has been about? #LocationLocationLocation #debatenight
.@realDonaldTrump lives in his own reality and wants to make it yours too. #debates
I feel like Hillary is the sober wife trying to tell her drunk  husband to shut the fuck up and leave #Debates2016
When she says he may not have paid taxes, he says "that makes me smart." YOU ARE RUNNING FOR FUCKING PRESIDENT. #debatenight
I'm actually excited to hear Hillary's answer to this race question. #debatenight
So he's proud that he wasn't accused of racist hiring practices at one building project? Like that's an accomplishment? #debatenight
Trump looks petulant when he stands their angrily and and says "NO. ... LIES. ... WRONG" into the mic while she's talking. #debatenight
Clinton: "Sometimes what happens in business is not good for the government" #Debates2016
Hillary talking about Cyber Security is like Bill talking about having a faithful marriage. #debatenight
Important to note that @WalshFreedom prepared for this debate WITHOUT paying his child support #DEBATES
No admission of guilt?! Thats LITERALLY how settlement agreements work.Its in the terms of EVERY settlement agreement. #debatenight
Yeah. He definitely pushed for a birth certificate for President Obama's sake. #forsure #debatenight
Sadly I believe Drumpf will cut taxes. I don't believe for a second that  $hillary will raise them on her contributors. #debatenight
And now Donald is dissing @HowardStern and @seanhannity Another classic "amnesia" case from Donald. #debatenight
it's about time that somebody running this country has an IDEA about money-@realDonaldTrump #debatenight
Common sense seems to be lacking in this country. Maybe that should become a class requirement. With a passing grade of an A+. #debatenight
@realDonaldTrump wants to be praised for bullying an African-American citizen to show his birth certificate #Debates2016
Is it me or I can't follow with this debate. Seems like nobody is really answering the questions. #debatenight
Both want to take guns away from AMERICAN citizens, charged with nothing, on an arbitrary gov't no-fly list. #UNCONSTITUTIONAL #debatenight
"It's all Bush's fault!!" - Hillary. When you have nothing else to say to defend your decisions. #debatenight
You don't have to be a politician to uplift downtrodden communities across this country. #justsaying #Debates2016
Somewhere off in Alaska, Sarah Palin is awakening from cryosleep at the mention of "Russia". #debatenight
#debatenight Only Trump cult give a damn about Hillary's emails...not everyone.. But Everyone does want to see his tax returns..
B52s old enough for you to fly... Oh that's right your foot hurt @realDonaldTrump #debatenight
This is like watching children argue on the play yard #Debates2016 #debatenight  #Debates
This question was about healing race relations? Answer the question.  #Debates2016
#debatenight awesome point scored, release the financials when Hillary releases her emails
"well, I have to respond" - but do you @realDonaldTrump? Do you really need to respond? #debatenight
Seriously, I would rather Michael Scott be president than Donald Trump. #debatenight
This has definitely helped me decide who to vote for. President Holt has a nice ring to it.   #debatenight
The debate so far Clinton: gives answer Trump: gives answer Lester: Trump, that wasn't the question.  #debatenight
@realDonaldTrump please ask her about the families &amp; friends of the men in Bengazi. #debatenight
I don't believe in publicly talking about my political views but I do believe in everyone being active in their views. #debate #Debates2016
Crazy how Hilary sounds just like Obama did in his debates. Word for word phrases. Funny
If you don't have anything to offer, you tear down the opponent. #EvanDebate #DebateNight
Can someone please get Donald Trump a tissue or some nasal spray? Or teach him how to breathe? 😂👃🏻 #debates
Yo my dad can't drive anymore I sure don't want him anywhere near a B-52 cockpit.  #debatenight
Hahaha. Tax cuts! Ronald Reagan! I was told to not say those words! Idiot. #debates
Don't the people of Libya deserve an apology for the Thousands of People slaughtered by Hillary's murder campaign? #debatenight
Lol... "I really don't think you disagree with me on this..." #trump has mad debate skills #Debates #debatenight
Preach Hillary, tell them about racial inequality and gun control. Let them know. #debatenight
"You don't learn that much from tax returns..." when they aren't properly filed and contain lies and omissions, true #Debates2016
Now I got the Law &amp; Order voice and theme playing in my head. #debatenight
Can't listen to Trump anymore. Too many wheatgrass shots. We're out. Please come pick up your children. #debatenight
Mudslinging contest so far... 🍷 Wonder why they failed to mention the repealing of the Glass–Steagall Act? #debatenight
"I take advantage of the laws of the nation" - Trump just actually said that. That's a headliner tomorrow, right there. #debatenight
"I was the one that got Obama to produce the birth certificate" WTF? #debatenight
FYI, taking the 5th Amendment does not make you immune from prosecution... #debates2016
@j_skav Just in case anybody wants to follow Donald Trump's interpretation of the Constitution next time they're arrested. #debates2016

trump: [yells] "I HAVE BETTER TEMPERAMENT THAN HER. IT'S MY BEST QUALITY." hillary: [smiles] [does not cut him off]  #debatenight
#debatenight There is NO DOUBT in my mind that Trump hates POC - he is a RACIST
Did she really bring an architect from his past to say he doesn't pay his bills? She honestly came prepared. Shitshow #Debates #debatenight
Hilary gently laughs and launches straight into rebuttal. I'm warming to this woman. 💖. Top delivery. 🎉  #Debates
All i know is that Lester Holt is about 30 seconds away from double middle fingering everyone and saying F**K This #debatenight

Did Trump just say "it makes me smart" when Clinton blamed him for not paying Fed taxes!! #Drumpf #debates
Even if I don't particularly like her, I have to appreciate her efforts to answer the questions efficiently. #Debates
#debatenight clinton is clearly offers nothing,no change no one gonna get a new job many bla bla about trump's taxes she is the loser so far
WWE Hall of Famer Donald Trump says he has been audited by Irwin R. Shyster. #RAW #Debates2016

"I think my strongest asset, maybe by far, is my temperament." @realDonaldTrump #LaughterFromAudience #REALITYCHECK #debatenight
"I take advantage of the laws of the nation" - dude running for president #DebateNight
First candidate to acknowledge that Harambe was in fact assassinated gets my vote. ANNNNNNNND GO! #Debates2016
Clinton's 08 campaign started the birther movement. They both lose on this. #debatenight
"A man who can be provoked by a tweet should not have his fingers anywhere near the nuclear codes" #Debates2016
"I say nothing." And with that, Trump summarizes his campaign for all of us. #debatenight #debates
I feel like Hillary is like, "let me just sit back and watch this fool fuck up." #debatenight
I love how bored she looks when Drumpf speaks... She looks like she's trying to pick between the cudgel or the epee #Debates2016 #ImWithHer
Man @Limberbutt2016 is looking like the best option for the Presidency this year #debatenight
Let’s face it, the GOP and the Democratic Party have nominated the two most horrible nominees in 50 years. #debatenight
No matter how well S&amp;F worked in NYC or anywhere else, the Fourth Amendment is good law, Mr. Trump. #debatenight
Most americans have not come inf rom Dubai or China. They have come in from Cincinnatti or Philly, or L.A. #debatenight
ICE? Immigration and Customs? You mean ISIS endorsed you. ICE is your code word #debates

This is a very interesting reality tv show is so cool hope it has more seasons! #Debates
So much excitement for #debatenight ! As you talk about issues important to you, remember to register to vote for #NVRD. #CelebrateNVRD
Once again Trump is critiquing everyone else and can't give details for how he will make things better. #debatenight
As much as I don't like her, Hillary did her homework #debatenight
clinton going on about 'vibrancy' of black churches and sweeping real problems under the rug lol #debatenight
Why is he allowed to over talk her?? Rude #debatenight she's allowing him to talk
#Trump gave too much salt at dinner?! Still hating on Rubio, homie?! #debatenight #Debates2016
Don't groan cause she called you out! She heard the dog whistle too, sir. #Debates2016
#Debates2016  Cops shooting blacks does not equal rampart gun violence, it's a trust issue with law enforcement
Does every body do a bad job? Does that account for the thousand's of people he has stiffed. @ExecWomHillary @hillaryclinton #debates2016
He does not care if other nations have nuclear weapons. Deeply troubling. @ExecWomHillary @hillaryclinton #debates2016
I'm sorry, maybe I missed it but did he answer the question at all? #debatenight
Lester, just tell them to shut up when you need to. It'll go by much smoother if you forcefully take control. #Debates
Clinton: The rich took our money Trump: China took our money    #debatenight #USPresidentialDebate
Trump mentions his quillionwhatever §§ earnings, not releasing his tax returns and US citizens being ripped off in one sentence. #Debates
#debatenight Trump pulls gold. Touches on people keeping their money out of the country because of rational disincentives to keep it in
#debatenight Stop and Frisk will get hammered by the moderator. But whites won't mind Donald defending it. Good. He should
EVERYTHING IS YOUR FAULT HILLS. The Don has spoken. Of course, he is a pathological liar. #debatenight
Laughing my ass off at Hillary’s face as she very blatantly continues to slip him more rope… #Debates2016
Lester ain't done not one ounce of fact checking. Type a sh....?! #Debates2016
"Barack Obama is a man of great man of dignity" and the crowd laughs.  #debatenight
If the rich don't have to pay taxes then why TF should we??? #debatenight
Trump just gets out of answering questions but rambling on about topics not even related to the topic #debatenight
#debatenight  Lester Holt helping Hillary again, as if he's on her staff. Wait? What? #NeverHillary
Imagine Ted Cruz debating Clinton right now. She'd probably run away in a coughing fit. #debatenight #theyallsuck
I've met people who have had their lives destroyed by Clinton's warmongering. #debatenight
Gotta love a total jackass mansplaining to one of the most competent humans to walk the earth. #makesmesick #Debates2016
"Bad people have guns..."  Donald Trump. Philanthropist. Pseudo politician. Captain obvious. #debatenight
The world is ripping off America? Trump must not travel much. #debatenight
Lester Holt is not correcting the audience when they react to Hillary. #debatenight #Debates2016
"I also have a much better temperament than she does." - Trump  Audience laughs.   "I have a winning temperament."  #Debates2016 #debates
Hillary's got More crappy sales pitches than a used car salesman! No one wants your book or website! #debatenight
"no, nope. you're wrong. murders are down" literally everything trump says in reply is just a flat no with zero explanation #debatenight
#Debates2016 I want a survey of African Americans who think trump is a positive force
Oh good. A detail for what @realDonaldTrump will do as president. Stop and frisk. #debatenight #Debates2016
When Hillary called Trump out for inviting his friend Putin to cyber hack the US 👀🐸☕️ #debatenight
IF every police group in the U.S. supports Donald Trump then EVERY police group in the U.S. is fundamentally flawed #DebateNight
Was that Lester Holt or the voice of God who just said "we need to move on". #Debates2016
Fun debate drinking game: drink every time Trump interrupts Hillary. You might almost forget just how rude he is #debatenight #debates
Come in from Dubai? How about barely being able to afford to fly?  #debatenight #2016election

"I think the best person in @HillaryClinton campaign is mainstream media." -Trump #debatenight #PresidentialDebate
Trump has gone from Obama to settling a lawsuit to opening a club and getting credit for it. And he's very very proud of it. #debatenight
@realDonaldTrump aren't some of your yearly audits finished? Couldn't you release the damn tax returns? #Debates2016
GIVE ME MY CREDIT ABOUT NOT DISCRIMINATING IN WEALTHY PALM BEACH! #Trump #Debates2016 #fb
.@realDonaldTrump: "I get audited almost every year...It's almost become a way of life." #debatenight
I don't know if I'm more or less scared for @realDonaldTrump to be president over another Republican because he's so crazy #Debates2016
Not watching the debates til I get home later so I’m running down the streets screaming Nononono! to any spoilers
Trump: I know you said you're sorry but let's talk about that thing you said 20 years ago that one time  #DebateNight
Yes because Sean Hannity is the most trustworthy man in America #DebateNight
Someone text @LesterHoltNBC that Trump campaign is deleting old tweets to hide things he has said. #DebateNight #TrumpCantHappenHere
Lester Holt asked Trump about his taxes and birtherism, which sucks because Trump can't even accuse him of being on his period. #debatenight
Trump-want to "take guns out of the hands of bad guys?" Hold corrupt &amp; white supremacist cops accountable. #debates #imwither
'My strongest asset is my winning temperment.' [Interrupts @LesterHoltNBC] 'WAIT' I know how to win.'-Trump #debatenight
"They havent been paying there fair share" scuze me sir. You havent paid your federal taxes don't talk about fair share #debatenight
"It could be someone sitting on their bed, who weighs 400 pounds"  Debate highlight   #debatenight
Trump: China, Japan, they're not paying us, and they should be, because we are WHAT? Sickening!  #debatenight
Welcome to Whose Country Is It Anyway where everything's made up and the votes don't matter #Debates2016
"The fed is doing political" - @realDonaldTrump. What the hell does that mean? #Debates2016 #DebateNight
The optics of Trump speaking over a black moderator while he attempts to ask about racial healing are rather problematic. #debatenight  😑
"A man who could be provoked by a tweet should not have his fingers anywhere near the nuclear codes" guh tru Hillary #debatenight
#debatenight trump is ridiculous how could anyone in their right mind vote for this narcissistic fool
You've taken business bankruptcy 6 times. You call yourself the king of debt  #debatenight #imwithher
"We came up with the Internet".....what? what does that have to do with anything?  #Debates
Working with Muslims and not disrespecting and ostracizing them? Your getting closer and closer to winning my vote HRC  #Debates
Trump never gives up a chance to say he has business or an investment in a city. #debatenight
Trump campaigning hard to be president of China. Apparently it's fucking amazing. #Debates2016
General gut feeling -- if you're complaining about the refs (looking at you @LesterHoltNBC) then you're losing. #debatenight
Why is @LesterHoltNBC only questioning @realDonaldTrump ? When will the biased media stop? 😡#Debates2016 #Debates #debatenight 🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸
I'm just dying to know what #trump looks like without the hairweave. #debatenight
Y'all better write in Bernie or Obama on them ballots come election day and vote for them or EVERYONE IS SCREWED #debatenight

Yes there are gangs in the street mr.trump. Some of them are called cops. Goodnight &amp; goodbye sir. #debatenight
Yeah airports are like at a third world country. One percent problems #debatenight
"It's all words it's all sound bites"... #Trump just described his whole campaign #debatenight
"Stop and Frisk worked really well in New York." Is Trump from a mirror universe where everyone has a goatee? #debatenight
He obviously has never landed in a sheep field in a 3rd world country. LGA is not a 3rd world country. #debatenight #ImWithHer
Every time Trump says "the African American community" it feels like a slur #debatenight
'The record shows otherwise' (re: Trump's denial of Iraq war support) @LesterHoltNBC #goodforhim #goodforus #goodfortherecord #Debates2016
Trump is so smart he doesn't pay taxes and soon all US citizens will not pay taxes!!! Vote for Trump!!! #debatenight #debates
It's braggadocious! Even though it is a real word It is something quite atrocious #debatenight
Why do I feel like Hillary keeps forgetting where she's at on that piece of paper. #Debates2016
Do they take a break so I can get more beer? #Debates2016
@HillaryClinton is lying. Her campaign started the Birther question. it's a fact. #debatenight
oh, we're playing the 'other countries should pay us for protection" track again. #Debates2016
I wish we could replace Trump with Jill Stein or vice versa. She will be destroying any of two fools. #Debates2016
what about ur emails? dont the american people deserve to see it? what are u hiding #Debates
Talking about racial bias...good...good... aaaand she lost me at the no-fly list #Debates2016
This debate is funny Clinton has all the statistics.. and Trump has all his opinions #debatenight
You can't go into a sovereign country and take their shit, Donald.  #Debates2016
Say black men! You want to say black men! Say it! @HillaryClinton you were doing so good. Talk about black men dying. #debates #
saying the same thing over and over doesn't make it true #Debates2016
How u gonna do that Donald, how u gonna take out ISIS??  Tell us your plan #debatenight
Trump is so educated that the only vocab word he uses is tremendous!!1! #DebateNight 👀☕️
...you know you can't just....TAKE oil, right? It's stuck in the ground. #debatenight
I think they actually want the same thing here.. or close to it.  #Debates
Y'all wanna complain about Hillary now but didn't go out and vote for my man Bernie wyd #debatenight
I have to give props to Trump on this debate tonight, he doesn't look as orange as an oompa loompa. #debatenight
What time in history has blowing other people up NOT started war? He's delusional. #debates
I thought this was #TrumpVsClinton but it seems Trump VS the World. #debates #debates2016 #debatenight
Lester bringing up the birther debate. My god. Shots are being fired all over this stage. It's a goddamn Wild West shoot out. #debatenight
He has property in Chicago! He knows what bad people are what. #Debates2016
Trump just said that ICE endorsed him.... I'm 100% sure a U.S. gov't agency CANNOT endorse a candidate. So says the Hatch Act. #debatenight
"I have a much better temperament than her." - @realDonaldTrump   *IS THIS HAPPENING  #debates
Not only does @HillaryClinton know the 5 second sound bite...she knows the background that takes days and years to gather.  #debates
I don't speak the language of Trump. Can anyone translate? It's all gibberish to me. #debatenight #WhatIsHeEvenSaying
"If we'd taken the oil, ISIS wouldn't have formed" there, he said something quotable as an extremely asinine comment. #debatenight #fixed
@DebateNight Eh... nevermind.  Let him continue making an idiot of himself.
Donald Trump: "I take advantage of the laws." You grossly take advantage of the middle class and the American people. #Debates2016
#debatenight #Debates2016 #debates @realDonaldTrump &amp; @HillaryClinton are in a virtual tie by the looks of it from an average voters POV
Five year olds don't deserve that.  RT @fmontiel_: Donald you have the temperament of a five year old. Girl, bye. #debatenight #election2016
If u r too dangerous to fly u r too dangerous to own a gun #nobrainer #Debates
The Only word which have been repeated thousands of time in this #Debates is " #Wrong " #Election2016 #Debates2016
Pleading the fifth is disgraceful. But lying, cheating, inciting violence, being a greasy jerk isn't. #debatenight
I got him to give the birth certificate.. no one was caring about it.. #debatenight #dumbtrump
Stop and Frisk!? As a Latino I must say ... Trump wallin #debatenight
This man just loves talking in circles. How is this real life right now #debatenight
So all Black people in the inner city are bad people? Really, Trump #debatenight
"The security aspect of cyber is very very tough" so so true. #debatenight
"Somebody sitting on their bed weighing 400 lbs." Because it always comes back to 8th-grade name-calling. #presidential #debates
Hahahahaha Trump just called the worlds largest and most reputable newspaper inaccurate #debatenight
@realDonaldTrump  I only have more disdain for your supporters, who are indeed #Deplorables #debatenight
. @HillaryClinton live fact checker? @realDonaldTrump treating this like an episode of #TheApprentice? What universe are we in? #debatenight
Trump saying he did a great thing because of no discrimination... You don't get a pat on the head for what goes without saying #debates
I love Law and Order.  Great show.  Fantastic.  We also have Law and Order: SVU Also fantastic.  Neither is real life.  #DebateNight
Trump should not be allowed to travel outside of Trump Tower.  #debatenight
Duck dodge dip dive and dodge, Trump took lessons from Patches O'Houlihan for that brirther question. #debatenight
Our country is being ripped off by the wealthy like you that hide behind audits. #Debates2016
Law and Order. We need it. If we don't have it, we need it. We need Law and Order in our country. We have endorsements #debatenight #Sniff
I feel like Trump is getting more talk time than Hillary #debatenight
Is he pitching for president, or his company? Makes you wonder. #debatenight #backupplan
"I have a feeling by the end of this evening I'm going to be blamed for everything that has ever happened." - Clinton #Debates2016
I made a mistake using a private e-mail but I'm not going to make excuses and take responsibility. - Clinton #Debates2016
#debatenight how's he not paying taxes? How do I get out of it lol
It would be nice if Andy Taylor could moderate one of these. Trump would have option to leave town or share a cell with Otis. #debatenight
#debates2016 #LoveTrumpsHate  Trump hasn't paid any income tax "makes me smart" Really? The rest of us dumb?
#debatenight I wonder if Hillary has a mute button in her ear.
So is Donald Trump going to release his emails as well as his tax returns? #debatenight
she's gotta call him out on his own outsourcing come on hillary #Debates2016
I've heard homeless schizophrenics articulate themselves more clearly than Trump can #debatenight
maybe it's just me and i'm not understanding what they're saying, but everything that trump's saying doesn't make sense? #Debates2016
#debates  We heard the truth .... not use to that from you CROOKED H
Trump you can't take out an entire terrorist group at once! Dummy! #Debates2016 #debatenight
If Trump really wants to get #GOP votes, maybe he should ease up on the phrase "Take away guns" #debatenight
Hillary's just like "I can't believe he's just walking into this..." #debatenight
People using filters on snapchat on the candidates faces is killing me. #Entertainment #debatenight #thisisawful
Trump just insulted and blamed 400lb bed somewhere for the DNC hacking. #debates #Debate2016
watching HRC pretend she isn't a racist, and Trump not bother pretending, is this election in a nutshell #debatenight
@AppleBetasDev @OfficialHoSay @debates You can put that away. It's not much of a show :/
Just bcuz someone DOESN'T say a word(s) doesn't mean they don't WANT to. Think of all the words I didn't use just now. Idiot. #Debates2016
I honestly don't want to vote but to keep certain people out of the office I have no choice.. #debatenight
The first time @HowardStern is mentioned in a presidential debate but no #bababooey #Debates2016
A person that is out of control saying someone else is out of control is outta control #debatenight
0579 : #DebateNight : The only way to really handle this is by following @the_ironsheik and his live tweeting.
Saying "wrong" over and over doesn't change whether or not someone is right. #debatenight
Trump is the only person on Earth who would brag about being audited literally every year.  #debatenight #factcheck2016
Even @seanonolennon has to admit, there's some crazy mansplaining going on right now. Woof! #debatenight
Donald Trump is a product of growing up with no home training.  #debatenight
Two people hiding stuff forcing the other the reveal that their hiding stuff.   #Debates
I don't know what's making me cringe more Donald Trump and Hilary bickering back and forth or the 8th graders live tweeting it #Debates2016
.@realDonaldTrump agrees with @HillaryClinton who said if you're on the watch list or no fly list, u shouldn't have a gun. #8NN #DebateNight
"The dope game is my sport, welcome to the wide world of snort" -@realDonaldTrump #sniff #debatenight #debates
Trump has said the words "Chicago", "Law and Order", "Guns", and "4000 people" 50 times in the past 3 minutes.  #Debates
This #debatenight is a perfect example of how men interrupt women and women politely wait to speak.
If this debate was Thanksgiving dinner I'd be the one watching football. #debatenight
"The NRA is very good people." - Donald AGAIN--&gt; remember, when people tell you who they are, believe them. #debatenight
SHUT UP I HAVE A WINNINNG TEMPERMENT!!! I HAVE THE GREATEST TEMPERMENT. THE BEST!!  #debates
I agree with #DonaldTrump that we need to bring back "Law &amp; Order." I miss that show. Sam Waterston is a national treasure. #Debates2016
Ohhhhh... the irony of @realDonaldTrump calling people out for their poor behavior &amp; choice of words. #debates2016
He cites Howard Stern as a reliable source for his denial of support for Iraq invasion. Need we continue? #Debates2016
Trump dont even lie you started that rumor about Obama and you pressed it into peoples minds so 🐸☕️ #debatenight
Hillary's red pant suit reminds me of the blood of the people she murdered. #debatenight #HillaryForPrison #MAGA #TrumpPence2016
I CAN SHOUT AT PEOPLE. VOTE FOR ME, I CAN SHOUT AT PEOPLE AND NOT LISTEN AT ALL! #debatenight
'I have a much better temperment than Secretary Clinton', says Trump after shouting angrily for 5 minutes straight. #debatenight
#Trump said #Obama should produce his birth certificate; so he's producing his? Or is this just #racialvilification? #debatenight
I HONESTLY CANNOT BELIEVE THESE ARE THE TWO CANDIDATES. AMERICA, WE ARE FUCKED. #DebateNight.
Money is the root of ALL evil. We let a money-hungry man lead this country &amp; we can only expect 2 have passion-less souls in the US #Debates

The first of three presidential #debates is almost over. Who is going to win? #HillaryClinton #DonaldTrump #Debates2016
Trump is advertising his hotel in front of a possible 100m people.  #debates
.@realDonaldTrump just accused @HillaryClinton of fighting Isis, founded in 1999, her "entire adult life". So, she's 38? #debates
"We have to tackle the plague of gun violence" @HillaryClinton YES! We can #EndGunViolence! #MomsDemandHillary #debatenight
I don't think I have enough wine to get through this #debatenight 🍷🍷
"I love the nasty commercials you do on Me that I don't do against you..." Ummm YouTube you have some splaning to do... #debates
He is even bullying the moderator. ..pls Donald, you can make a point without shutting others up #realdonaldtrump #debatenight
I am going to cycle so fucking hard in spin class my bike is going to come off the stand.  #debates #ragercise
Is donald trump using memes to challenge hillary in this debate? #debatenight
I don't know what's better watching the debate or reading my twitter roll. #debatenight
SHE IS UNDER HIS SKIN!!! "MAYBE HE DIDNT DO A GOOD JOB" so does that mean you dont have to pay? Ohhh yeah. Orange hulk is pisses 😂😂 #debates
"You 👏shouldn't 👏have 👏a👏 profit👏 system👏 to👏 fill👏 prisons👏 with 👏young👏 Americans." #Debates
I doubt Palm Beach is the wealthiest hood in the world. Hello UAE?? Also he said Mooslims right?K #Debates
What as he saying about his ten-year old son?  He doesn't finish his sentences!  #Debates
Did she really say, "A person who runs a business isn't someone who would be able to run a government?" Give or take a word? #debatenight
HILLARY. JUST SAY STOP AND FRISK IS UNCONSTITUTIONAL. JUST REPEAT IT. Over and over and over. #debatenight
This debate needs @GovGaryJohnson. Can we have one serious person on the stage please?! #debates
How are u gonna go from "I was the one who got him to produce the birth certificate" to "I wanna defeat ISIS" #debatenight
Fact Check: Hillary Clinton did in fact use all three of those words in her answer. Law, And, &amp; Order. #debates #debatenight #Debates2016
You hear that hackers? Donald Trump says you're all oppressively obese. 400 lbs. You know what to do. #debates #debatenight #Debates2016
There is a lot of drama on this debate #debatenight but I don't like drama.
Do you think before the debate Sean Hannity was like "Don, I'm so lonely" and Trump was like "I gotchu" #debatenight #Debates2016
Hillary says gun safety measures would make a difference - keep guns out of the hands of those who would do harm #debatenight
You know who else did what Hillary did wthe emails???? Colin Powell Rick Perry and Trump's own friend Chris Christie. #Debates
Hillary apologizes... Trump is that guy who says, "I told you so!" This childish banter is hilarious #debatenight #mature
I honestly can't watch any more of the debate. The amount of nonsense they spew is even worse than UK political debates. #ShitShowDebate
Wow - first applause of the night comes from call for Hillary to release the 30k deleted emails  #debatenight
Opening a club confirms you are not a racist. Oh @realDonaldTrump I am learning so much. On how to be a racist. #debatenight
This is embarrasing. She is walking all over  this dude. #debatenight
These #debates will get to the root of the problem: people. Human dang ol' beings. We're just the pits!
But really, most of what she just said. I'd be game with that. #Debates2016
Do we have a counter for how many times trump says "tremendous"?  #debatenight
Wait did he just say "Sitting on there bed weighting 400 pounds"? 😒 #debatenight
Because bragging about $650 million annual earnings is the way to win over the average middle American. #debatenight
HRC slay slay slay. #debatenight trump trying to say he has developed good ties with the African American communities in the USA. Pshhh
Trump, you have to learn the rules of a debate. Lester, you need to control this child. #debatenight
Please notice how often Hillary Clinton is NOT interrupting Trump. He does not seem presidential.  #debatenight
#Debates slogan slamming  #America is more sophisticated than that #Hill  only one king on her hill
YOU JUST TALKED ABOUT HOW "GOOD" STOP &amp; FRISK WAS. GTFOH!! #DebateNight
Donald Trump just doesn't know how to shut the fuck up and it's pretty annoying. #debatenight
can't ... keep up ... with the fact checking. Thanks to those who are! #debatenight #Debates2016
Donald is the king of not answering a single da*n question. #debatenight
HRC coining superpredator was bad. But uh...Donald J Trump advocated putting innocent kids on death row. #debatenight
lester doesn't really have control of the place but i think it's actually working well #debatenight
I have so many people muted bc the debates on LMAO
TRUMP KEEPS CHANGING THE TOPIC, WHY? Cause he's not prepared to be president 😏😂 #debatenight
Funny how Donald blames 30 years of economic crisis on @HillaryClinton yes let's blame the one as if 42 men before her were saints #Debates
Cool, calm and collected vs. yelling to cover up lies... I've been on both sides. I get it. #debatenight
@realDonaldTrump just said he "took advantage" of laws to benefit himself and his family. Nothing for working families. #Debates
"I could give you a list of banks". Yeah because the banks are so trustworthy #debatenight #WellsFargo
"Law and order" circa Richard Nixon and the endorsement of the FOP and stop and frisk. Way to line up against the "Blacks". #debatenight
It's all words. What happens when he declares war, they're just words???? #Debates2016
Dear Donald: Things that are important to you are NOT important to the country. #debatenight
A man provoked by a tweet should have access to a nuclear button. #OldieButGoodie @HillaryClinton #Debates2016 #ImWithHer
#debates #DonaldTrump He is having a series of brain farts tonight. Exploding now from his mouth. Careful in the front row!
Trump is dominating on passion alone. This is an early massacre #debatenight
She tried to have him not say what he just said. #DebateNight
How many of these "debates" do they have scheduled?   #debatenight #Debates2016
Hillary is creepy when she smiles with guilt and rage.   #debatenight
Why would releasing tax returns be pegged on the Emails? He's not willing to make them public #Debates2016
I honestly do feel bad for Clinton that she has to basically debate a child though jfc. I applaud her patience #debatenight
#Hillary has a video of a mushroom cloud explosion appear on the Titantron, #Trump stares in awe, mouth wide open #Debates2016
If you watch Hillary's eyes, you can see the exact second she goes to her happy place &amp; it is the only thing keeping me calm.  #Debates2016
Wait,... if the issue w/ Clinton's emails was possible leaked gov't secrets,... why insist those emails be released?! #Drumpf #debatenight
There it is... it didn't take long for both candidates to have their "bait and switch" and "lies" evident on #debatenight.
I feel so close with the rest of the world watching #debatenight  on twitter. &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3
NATO is not opening up a terror division. The man is full of shit! #debatenight

Instead of being president, can Donald Trump have a TV show where he reacts to things people say #debatenight #YoureFired
Someone needs to give Lester Holt a buzzer to help him interrupt. #Debates2016

Someone give Hillary the Nobel Peace Prize for the amount of rude, obnoxious interruptions she's had to endure #debates
I thought this was a debate, it's more like a damn comedy show #debatenight
Yo, Donald? Saying "You're wrong" does not make someone wrong when they are stating facts. No matter how many times you say it. #debatenight
"I say nothing." = the first accurate thing @realDonaldTrump has said all night. #debatenight
why didn't trump press bush to produce his birth certificate? or bill clinton? or the other bush? 🤔 #Debates2016
Now Trump is defending him refusing to pay his workers. But he's going to turn our economy around. #debates

DJT says LH is wrong; but DJT is wrong on that.  #Debates2016
Important HRC is talking about how gun violence mostly affects minority communities, not just mass shootings that get the attn #DebateNight
"Before I say anything, I just want to start off by saying."  If the debate answer does not begin with this, it does not count. #debates
Pay me for protecting you. Ok but that goes both ways.  #Debates
He's an asshole idiot... I "take advantage of the laws". Exactly, if it benefits him!!! That's not a man for every American!! #debatenight

We've seen @realDonaldTrump law &amp; order plan: In the transatlantic slave trade thru Jim Crow wings of #NMAAHC. #Debates2016 #Shesgotmyback
She's pressing on all his insecurities, and he's gonna snap eventually. #debatenight
Trump says he will release tax returns once Clinton releases 33k emails. There seems to be no correlation. #Debates
"Trumped up trickle down" sounds like a year 2000 punk rock band.  #debatenight
I have to agree, we do need more Law &amp; Order. I love Jerry Orbach #debatenight
I’ve mostly been listening to this (because: twitter) but I finally watched the screen for a bit and he looks PISSED. #debatenight
Oh so just now, recently, you made some black friends? Good for you Donald...good for you....#debatenight
No one wants to talk to Sean Hannity, Trump.   ALSO YOU CANT STATE OPINIONS AS IF THEY ARE FACTS  #Debates2016
Obama and Clinton created a vacuum taking out Ghadafi, but Bush made a far bigger one taking out Hussein. #debatenight
Speaking of jobs, can we all agree that .@LesterHoltNBC has the worst job right now. #debatenight
Trump: "you don't learn a lot from tax returns. you learn more from tax disclosures." #debatenight
Hold up! All this time Trump has been telling EVERYONE not to watch CNN but now he telling y'all to watch CNN for FACTS🤔😂😂 #debatenight

"I haven't given much thought to NATO" - Donald Trump 9/26/16 (this is the guy who wants the button. Not much thought?)  #trump #debates2016
Hillary - you are getting killed! Just ask him about his taxes! #debates
#debates stop saying the President's name @realDonaldTrump You're not good enough to mention his name
#debates Yes, the gov't sued many people because this country is filled with racist behavior that needs to be eliminated
Regardless what the questions are, trump is saying what he prepared😂 #Debates2016
I'm ready for Trump to make her make have a heart attack or something. #DebateNight
I don't think Trump has been to a 3rd world company... #debates
...well Trump that's because you're admin. will not hold police depts accountable, so they flock to support you. #debates
Trump wants to take the Oil. On national television. The Rep. nominee just admits we should have pillaged the ME post-war. Holy... #debates
Clinton: "Implicit bias is a problem for everyone, not just police."  SPEAK. ON. IT. #debatenight
Every time he says law and order I hear that *dun-dun* from the show in my head...anyone else? #debatenight
"We have to bring back Law and Order!  The original.  Not this SVU shit.  Make Law and Order great again!" #debatenight
Maybe you could invite your "friends" down to answer these questions #Debates2016
Hey Donald what about when you offered $1million to charity if he produces it... #Debates2016
so the husband turned on #debatenight  and now my blood pressure is actually going off the charts. 🍷
Definitely would not be able to be a moderator for this. I'd literally drown in a pool of absurdity😂✋ #debates
Wait. What? You can't just say law and order over and over and fix everything? What are you talking about Hill? #debates
Trump accuses Clinton of preparing 4 debate. Clinton sez:I prepared 4 this debate &amp; I prepared 2 be President. You go Hillary! #debatenight
@realDonaldTrump Protecting inner cities by letting police do what they need to do? No reality in his world. #debatenight
There is a divide amongst police and communities and @realDonaldTrump has no idea how to address the problems other than (1/2)  #debatenight
@realDonaldTrump Attacking the Iran Deal and saying Iran is gonna be a major power? The fuck? #debatenight
#debatenight  Hillary grew up in an upper-class suburb of Chicago and attended an upper-class High School.  Give me a break.  Hillary lies.
#debatenight did Trump just miss an opportunity to address her concern about cyber security &amp; her unsecure email server?  Not a debater.
@TaylorTwellman #debatenight Lost control in the first 10 minutes, never got it back
I know @PolitiFact has 18 fact checkers on this, but there is no keeping up with Trump. #Debates
All this rhetoric around The Middle East (esp Iran) in the debate is p disappointing #debatenight #PresidentialDebate
#debatenight he keeps saying Sean Hannity like he's gonna show up like Beetlejuice.
it's funny bc the average voter wouldn't care about @realDonaldTrump's tax return if he would've just released them earlier. #debatenight
@realDonaldTrump gets annoyed by @HillaryClinton's tweet comment. Tells her it's "not even a good line." #ImWithHer #debatenight
Lol. Libs are so shocked that someone else is gaming the system instead of Hillary. They thing she owns that.   #debatenight
"Time for this country to have somebody to runs it who knows about money." Boom! Why am I just hearing this at 940? #Debates2016 #1210Debate
I thought this question was about race, not policing or gun control. C'mon Hill. #debates
Clinton: We need to address the systemic racism in our criminal justice system. We can't just say law &amp; order. We need a plan. #debatenight
Trump: I'm all for NATO but we have to get NATO to to into Mideast and knock the hell out of ISIS. #debatenight #debates2016
Trump said we should have taken the oil. The oil? That was someone else's country. Whaaaat is this? #debatenight
#Hillary gives us 2 minutes of race platitudes. #Trump sums his position up in 3 words: "law and order." It works for him. #Debates2016
"Japan needs to defend itself!" Do you not understand the basics of Japan's constitution, WHICH WE WROTE? #debatenight
@midwestspitfire Stump speech and rudenss, not one iota of a semblance of ANY PLAN or SOLUTION to ANYTHING. #debatenight @realDonaldTrump
@YNB please tell me you will have a TWD journal for the debates.Other fact checkers step aside. And drumpf would cry. Please. Make. Happen.
"And it was accurate in the New York Times...which is unusual for the New York Times." Lol ok #debates2016
"Don't paint such a negative picture......If you're African American you are likely to go to jail" #debatenight
#Trump "uses certain laws that are there" and takes advantages of law to do well for himself - explaining SIX bankruptcies ... #debatenight
The more Donald talks about money the more I want to see his tax returns.  #debatenight
Why does Trump love talking about Law and Order? What else does a fat old man watch at 2pm while eating a pint of ice cream? #debatenight
Am I the only one, or does all Trump's sniffing remind them of they're HS friend that got hooked on cocaine?  #debatenight
Recap: Clinton accused Trump of (and he didnt deny): not paying taxes /stiffing contractors /lying / rooting for housing crisis #debatenight
Trump: "I'm satisfied with it" Hillary: "I will never be satisfied" #hamilton #debates
I can't wait until they make fun of this debate on SNL #debatenight
Hillary's doing good on the defense/let him explode strategy but has she landed a really good punch yet? #debatenight
What is happening to Trump why is he panting like that?  #DebateNight
Holy Fuck hahaha. "I helped Obama by questioning  his citizenship!" #DebateNight
Trump has been trying so hard not to go 100 percent temper tantrum. #debatenight
Because all hackers that expose DNC corruption are from #Russia , maybe #Democrat files very exciting for Hackers.   #debatenight #debates
#debatenight Gary Johnson would make this debate better and that is saying a lot.
Side Note: @CSPAN is airing #DebateNight completely split screen. Seeing their reactions at all times is outright comedy.
Trump uses the email rhetoric which fits in perfectly to attack Hiliary and slams her #debatenight #Debate2016
#DebateNight ##Debates Is Hillary really trying to say the black community isn't in complete ruin?
Why does every "answer" that Donald gives have something to do with his business and/or investments?! #debatenight #ImWithHer
#Holdyourvote melanated people nether one of them are for us we need to create our own party  #Debates
What about reparations for black people something that was written in a treaty and we never received I don't hear Nada  #Debates

"A very against police judge" -- I thought he went to UPENN???  Oh right, daddy got him in. #debatenight
Lol @ everyone refuses to call Sean Hannity. Yeah, I know that I don't want to call Sean Hannity. #debatenight #Debates2016
This is an absolute joke. Trump is turning this into an absolute mockery just like he has with everything else. #debatenight
"A very against police judge" is the kind of phrase my fourth graders would use. #debatenight
Every time Trump says "believe me" I feel like he's about to sell me a piece of a bridge #ImWithHer #DebateNight
We suppose to pat you on the back for opening a club? It's my American right to pop bottles you get no applause. #DebateNight
So Trump wants to raise or lower interest rates? It's not clear from that answer on taxes 😕 #Debates2016
Trying to take them out for a long time... Her entire adult life??? #Debates
Hillary says "cavalier." Trump does not know this word. He tries it out in his own sentence. It fits. Great success. #Debates
#debatenight #trump is on a smear campaign , just like a reality star
.@HillaryClinton talking directly to the "American people" is a good move. Bring it to them. #debates2016
Uh oh, Trump just pitted the US3 against the ME3 again! LAX, JFK, LGA, EWR-3rd world airports? Kinda agree re: Newark... ;) #debates
Hmmm...very important to you? We don't care what's important to you. What about us? #debatenight
Trumps just stated he has common sense. Biggest lie of the night. #debatenight
When @realDonaldTrump talks against racism he ends up endorsing an unconstitutional act because it was racial profiling #debatenight #idiot
It's time we had someone keeping politicians in check.  His yelling is passion. I like passion #debatenight
Did this dickwad just tell a grown ass woman she was "out of control"? #debatenight
Who is moderating this, Lester or Donald?! Stand up for yourself Lester!!!!! #Debates
Trump, you don't know money! You would likely be better off financially if you invested your inheritance! #debatenight
How do we decide who the "good people" and "bad people" are? #debatenight
Hillary Clinton has been fighting Isis for the majority of her adult life? Really?!? #debatenight #americanpolitics
"it could be someone on their couch that weighs 400 lbs" - donald trump SMH #debatenight
There should be some kind of punishment for interrupting/ignoring the moderators #debates
Hillary gotta stop trying to make "trumped up trickle down" happen. It's not going to happen. #debatenight #debates
Did he say this is the worst return from a recession???? #DebateNight
@DonaldTrump @HillaryClinton  Once again, a woman is not defined by the actions of her husband, Trump. She is her own person. #debatenight
The place where we need to restore law and order most of all is on Wall Street. #OccupyTheDebates #debates
If anyone was messing with US elections, all evidence points to #DNC rigging the primary against BernieSanders. #OccupyTheDebates #debates

"I have a feeling by the end of the night I'll be blamed for everything" -HC "why not" -Trump #debatenight
.@ABC You are a sponsor of the Presidential Debates. Democratize the debates! #openthedebates

Trump never had two minutes in his life where he was supposed to shut up. #debatenight
"I think I did a great job in badgering the president constantly, propagating a rumor that the president wasn't born here." #Debates2016
Donald Trump is #rattled #erratic and #outofcontrol - Is this who we want as President #debatenight #Debates2016
This "Trumpped up Trickle down" sound bite is not going to catch on #debatenight
I know I'm not the only one who googled  #braggadocious to make sure if it was a real word #debates #DonaldTrump #hillaryforpresident
How do you tell the commentator that he's wrong? And what do you mean "these people?" You still think he's a good guy? #Debates2016
20 minutes into the debate and the moderator has already lost control. More hits in the debate than MNF. #Debates2016
What happened to the policy of no applause?! here we go - the emails are thrown into the mix! #debatenight
Yeah, LAX is trash. But Dullas and Reagan aren't bad at all #debatenight
"i have a much better temperament than she does" he says with a terrible temperament #debatenight
$600 million dollars is not a lot of money....said no broke MF EVER!!!!#debatenight

#debates What the hell is he talking about? I, ME ,I, ME, I, ME, I, ME.
#debatenight Lester needs to turn the mic off when they don't stop. Eh hum...D.Trump. He's all over the place!
#debatenight So, Trump does understand that it doesn't work to talk nice after you've insulted and degraded people. Guess it was on purpose
All evening I've been watching Donald Trump making  funny faces. waiting for him to look at his watch.  #Debates
OBVIOUSLY CLINTON ACTS DIFFERENTLY TOWARDS OBAMA NOW THAT HE IS HER PRESIDENT NOT HER CAMPAIGN OPPONENT #debatenight
how much did u have to pay to get peeps to endorse u Donald? #debatenight #debates
it was the illegal invasion of Iraq which helped create ISIS #debatenight #debates
The moderator's hair is all fucked up! Boi has a forehead bigger than this debate. #Debates
Why is Black &amp; Latino keep being associated with Gangs and violence lol #Debates2016
"Law and order in the inner cities" is really dog-whistle code for "we need more Robocop/Charles Bronson in Death Wish." #Debates2016
Moving on to talk about race. I can barely watch. This will not be enobling.  #debatenight
This #debatenight needs to end already.  I can't laugh/like/retweet fast enough to keep up.
What were the odds on the prop bet Howard Stern's name would be dropped in the #debates?
So a man who's never been in the White House situation room thinks he knows how to handle terrorists better than HRC? Really? #debatenight
"I think I did a good job" on procuring a birth certificate? and connecting with the AFrican American community?!! #debatenight
Did Trump say we are a "debtor nation" or a "deader nation?" [We might be the latter if we don't vote right in November.] #debatenight
It's like @BernieSanders is speaking through @HillaryClinton at the 1st Presidential Debate 2016! #debatenight
I wish I had Hilary Clinton's patience... I would have thrown something at the OrangeTurd ages ago #Debates2016
Why are they talking about Obama right now? There's other better topics  #debatenight
Trump says "you and 'your president"  THAT'LL SURE WIN OVER THE AFRICAN-AMERICANS!  #debatenight
#debatenight if I had to drink every time I heard tremendous I'd be hammered right now
HRC just needed to show up and say nothing. Trump sounds like an idiot. #debatenight
Watching the debate is like watching 2 year olds fight over a toy. #disappointed #debatenight
Hillary Clinton speaking up about the racism in America head on is what we need in a President. #Debates2016
How to president: 1. Don't disagree with unconstitutional things, 2. Don't argue with systemic racism when it clearly exists #debates
Treat America like a business? Sure! Most businesses fail in 4 years, most businesses do not outlast countries. #debates
This debate is tremendous. Everyone is talking so very tremendous. My gin and tonics IV to get through this is SO TREMENDOUS! #debatenight
"I haven't given lots of thought to NATO". substitute any policy or topic in there and you have trump's platform in a nutshell #debatenight
The election will be close. And, yes, Trump has a chance to win, but that's because the election is about who we are not about him #debates
What's this whole 'you show me yours &amp; I'll show you mine' rubbish? You're running for President, not in school playground!! #debatenight
Five minutes is all I needed to hear- @HillaryClinton you're the strong woman I aspire to be. @realDonaldTrump you're a bully! #DebateNight
His best asset is his temperament? So refreshing to hear @realDonaldTrump admit he doesn't have any good assets. #debatenight
Yes Trump tell those in debt more about how rich you are #Debates2016
How is it racist to question a place of birth?  #debatenight
Trump talks about endorsement from NRA while he has talked about bad lobbyist  Oh... oh the wonderful irony #debatenight
#debates "Trump just criticized me for preparing for the debate ... And I have also prepared to be the president" - Hillary
Someone buy him a thesaurus. I feel like he has a 10 year olds vocabulary. #debatenight
I produced racial healing by questioning the legitimacy of our nation's first black president.   Sounds legit Donald.   #debatenight
@LaurieLee0966 @HillaryClinton  Small Business and the small working force will pay for it! #debatenight
Of course he knows about money and debt, declaring bankruptcy over and over again gives you an insight to working the system #debatenight
Seriously, did he pay for the hotel ad time...I'm not here to hear about a hotel I'm never staying at #debatenight
Man, it's a good thing I'm not drinking while watching this debate. I'd have alcohol poisoning by now. #debatenight
Okay all you wealthy people - show of hands if youve ever said youre not paying your fair share Hillary said.  .  . . . *crickets* #Debates

hillary: good point trump: makes a face hillary: challenges a point trump: rolls eyes  when will he give a legitimate answer? #debatenight
When you can easily tell who everyone goes for from their snapchat stories #debatenight
Did Trump just FAT shamed people by saying people weighting 400lbs are hackers? Atleast didnt say FAT PIG #Debates2016 #Election2016
I see the debate as 2 children fighting more so than a presidential debate.... #debatenight
@LesterHoltNBC I'm kinda digging Lester Holts subtle sarcasm and determination to keep this #debatenight on track!
Did he just say that stop and frisk worked? Whaaa  #debatenight
#debatenight   "What is Trump hiding?!"  My God Hillary you have no leg to stand on.
Trump is in debt to special interests... This just got real. #debatenight
Trump no one cares about your spoiled 10 year old son. #debatenight
"I'm not saying I'm not guilty. I'm just saying I never admitted guilt." Trumpish #debatenight #Debates2016
I hope she has a dizzy spell and falls flat on her face. It might be an improvement to her looks #Debates
"I screw people over in business because it's not illegal." -Trump basically. #debatenight #debate
But did everyone peep how neither of them spoke about the racial divide and their approach towards it... #debatenight
Stop and frisk won't work in Chicago. Completely different city than NYC #Debates
"We need more Law &amp; Order!! Look at CSI, they have Miami, they have Las Vegas, New York!! We need more Law &amp; Order!!" -Donald #Debates2016
How many times is Trump going to say the word "wrong"? Shut up already #debatenight
Trump needs to answer the questions and stop talking about himself #debatenight
Then again, I hope Trump's continuous interrupting is reflecting as poorly as it should #debatenight
Thank you, Lester, for admonishing the audience for their applause during that moment. This should not be that kind of debate #debatenight
"I'm not gonna make any excuses, it was a mistake" Hillary re: her emails #debatenight
RT: "@tini_saurus Trump: and no one calls him sean hannity. CJ: well what do they call him then? #debates  @CJShep10 #lolololol@"
What on earth does the "birther" issue have to do with the next president? Hillary started that track of thought years ago #Debates2016
Wait, @HofstraU, are you seriously applauding for the emails right now? As he expounds on how he's been under IRS audit for yrs?? #Debates
Settled that suit without it costing any money or admitting guilt does not = innocent #Trump #DebateNight
Stop calling her Secretary Clinton. She's a former one. Call her Hillary. She's an equal now. #debatenight #Debates2016
#debatenight I feel a head bob coming on...preceded by that stupid smile
Are there no commercial breaks? I need to make some popcorn. #debatenight
Keep saying “Hack In” just... keep going... its making you sound like you know what you’re talking about. #debatenight
ACTUALLY pleading the fifth isn't the same as pleading guilt. It's saying I don't want the opposition to build a false narrative#debatenight
Again, if dumb Donald knew anything about Hillary's long record of criminality he could take her apart. #debatenight
#debatenight Yeah, it also determines whether or not you live or die when your car breaks down
Personally I'd rather see her 30 thousand emails than his tax returns!!! #debatenight #CrookedHillary
"I think implicit bias is a problem for everyone, not just police." #debates
@realDonaldTrump and @HillaryClinton  Donald and Hillary just going for low blows instead of debating. #debates
What is he sniffing??? Why does he keep sucking up! Some one give #TRUMP a #Kleenex  #Debates
As a 20 something living in America I find it important to vote . Make a difference y'all #beanexample #debatenight
You don't know SHIT about the African American Community. You cannot speak for us. #debatenight #Debates2016
So I'm going to give the nuke codes to this asshat?  #debates
The speed of Twitter: There's already a @TrumpSniff account with 1,500 followers.  #debates #fb
He asked you a question about your taxes Donald, answer the damn question. #debatenight
WOW.. Is he justifing being a racist? #debatenight  because you open a club does not mean you no longer racist. Dumb ass
"If your main claim to fame is your business we should talk about that." Perfect!  #debatenight #Debates2016
What does he keep going on about? Just his bad business deals. Every other word is "I"  #debates
No federal taxes paid makes him smart? Zow. He does live in his own reality where OPM pays the bills. #ImWithHer #Debates2016
"We have to bring back Law And Order". Great TV show. #debatenight
Is he sniffing or snorting what are those sounds Donald is making?#Debates2016
@HillaryClinton is right about the importance of diplomacy and talking to people not isolating ourselves. #debatenight
"As soon as the audit is finished, after I'm elected, I'll release the tax returns no problem." #Debates2016
I see a smart woman with plans, ethical considerations, and experiences fighting a bully which simplify just everything. #DebateNight
Now he's citing 3,000 shootings. The man is out of his mind #debates  #debatenight #Debates2016
It is necessary to cut his mic when it is not his turn. STOP LETTING HIM INTERRUPT. #debatenight
Did Hillary just shimmy?  YES!!  THAT IS THE LAST SQUARE ON MY BINGO CARD!! #debatenight   BINGO!!
@realDonaldTrump just said(and he was deadly serious) I have better temperament thnHRC! #haveatittwitter #Cocaineispowerfuldrug #debatenight
Q: How do you plan to Achieving Prosperity? H:Today is my granddaughters 2nd birthday T:My father gave me a small loan in 1995 #debatenight
What was produced was a poorly photoshopped, highly manipulated document which was not real....#birthcertificate #debatenight
*gasp* he used a word above a 5th grade reading level!!!! #debatenight #braggadocious
I think it's a faux pas to demand other countries pay their fair share when Donald pays $0 taxes. #debatenight
@HillaryClinton maybe @realDonaldTrump tryin to hide something terrible in not releasing tax returns. Maybe he isn't that rich #debatenight
@realDonaldTrump tells @HillaryClinton stop acting "Holier that thou."  She disrespected @BarackObama when running against him #debatenight
This DICKHEAD Trump said not paying taxes "makes him smart" -- disgusting. 🎃#Debates2016
Trump is Bob Rumson on steroids: tells you what to fear &amp; who's to blame. ZERO solutions or plans. 🎃💩#Debates2016
What a f--king bully. He's in full sputtering insanity mode. #Debates2016 🎃
Why does Trump keep talking about himself &amp; his own achievements? #debatenight
Can we please send @realDonaldTrump to Pennsylvania Ave via plan B!  😂😂😂 #DebateNight #ImWithHer
Both candidates scare me. Each for different reason reason but they scare me. #Debates
Still waiting for the camera to zoom out and some one say, "Live from New York its Saturday Night" #debatenight
@realDonaldTrump is going to be beating the #RiggedDebate drum hard after the show they made him look like a #WhinyLittleBitch #debatenight
Is Woody Allen moderating this fucking thing?  What the fuck.  #debates
Haaaaa! Cybersecurity! Like the lack of it on an unsecured server in the basement? #Debates2016 #HillarysEmails #HillarysLies #NeverHillary
Our secrets being stolen, oh wait is he talking about @HillaryClinton deleted emails!! #DebateNight
Trump: all talking points, personal anecdotes and sound bites, very little reasoning. #debatenight
why does he keep drinking water..?? i guess is getting to hot in there...#debatenight
Is it bad that I'm impressed when Trump doesn't try to yell over Hillary #Debates2016
Trump's speaking points for this were just "Stop and Frisk" scrawled on a bar napkin #Debates2016
Tax cuts did not create jobs... EVER The companies keep that money and give themselves bonuses #debates #Debates2016 #debatenight
#Debates if she cared so much about our lives why did she and Obama leave all the men to die in Benghazi? Dropped the ball then and now.
"Everyone says" and "lots of places" = Trump drinking game winners for tonight  #Debates2016
All I hear when he talks is blah, blah, blah never answers a fucking question. #Debates
Donald #Trump just endorsed his 10-year-old son as his head of cyber security. #Debates2016
Omg. I need something happy now. Someone bring me a cookie. #debatenight
I think "4000 since January" is the only gun stat Trump knows  #debates
"A very against police judge" Trump's debate is just one long Mad Libs. #debatenight
We need to call @seanhannity (an ABSOLUTE Trump-surrogate) to absolve Trump of his Iraq invasion endorsement? Sheesh #debatenight
The media better do nothing but talk about how much a child Donald was during this. #debatenight
HILARY WITH THE SHADE!!!! How are you speaking on taxes and you don't pay them! #debatenight
she was NOT disrespectful in her debates against obama lol she's not even being disrespectful of the sack of shit she's on stage with now
We now have tax returns (against lawyer's advice) if HRC releases her missing emails. #debatenight
Such a perfect answer! She has a plan. Now let the racist talk about racial tension. #Debates2016
YASSSS Hillary! The birther movement is racist. Yes it was Donald's fight. Now he's stepping back? #Debates2016
WHY should the president have to produce his birth certificate? Just because he's black? #Birther #racism #debatenight
If these #DebateNight characters were football coaches  Donald Trump = Rex Ryan Hillary Clinton = James Franklin Lester Holt = Larry Coker
@Mikwen_nV both are pretty shitty, if only @GovGaryJohnson was in the debates you might see some intellect
I agree with Trump. THEY SHOULD NEVER HAVE CANCELED LAW &amp; ORDER! #Debates
I thought Donald Trump was actually winning the debate until he started being racist! #Debates2016 #wedemhillarys
You know, I'm actually quite surprised Trump doesn't pronounce it "Nucular" weapons. #Debates2016
#debatenight @realDonaldTrump you are one of the many reasons we are in shit. You claimed bankruptcy 6 times...hello
@realDonaldTrump is proud that at some point in time he was lest racist than others #DebateNight
Can we just change Hillary's name to Jim from The Office? #debatenight
So far trump is doing well on the job question, but the race isssue is concerning for both ..good luck my afroamerican brothers #debatenight
Trump is talking as if Hillary has been president for the last 30 years #debatenight #debates
When @realDonaldTrump is talking about "Law and Order", I'm REALLY hoping he's talking about SVU with @Mariska #debates2016 #debatenight
Listening to Trump speak is giving me a headache. Like what 😒. He keeps walking around these questions #Debates
650 million isn't a lot of money ? Good job relating to the average American #debatenight
Trump refuses to release tax returns &amp; asks why he keeps getting audited. Might be because 3 of his companies have gone bankrupt. #debates
Trump must be getting his "facts" from Katrina Pierson because he's all over the place.  #Debates2016
10-year olds in 2016 know how to use computers. More news at 10. #debatenight
Faces @HillaryClinton is making have been made by EVERY SINGLE WOMAN YOU'VE EVER KNOWN. Go get 'em Mrs. Secretary. #ImWithHer #debatenight
HE DID NOT JUST SAY HE HAS A BETTER TEMPERAMENT THAN HILLARY #debatenight
Let's think of this, the big companies ruling the economy even more. Wtf is wrong with Trump. #debates
Law and Order, the outrage exists due to bad police office in NC. #debatenight
🔥Boom - made because you have not paid any federal income tax #Debates2016
What is he even saying right now ? Anyone ? Is there going to be a translator for him soon ? #debates
Scarce:Trump do you owe any money to IRS? Trump:No I don't! Scarce:There you guys, you heard it Trump doesn't owe money to IRS #debatenight
Trump's vocabulary makes me forget that English is my 3rd language. #debatenight #FromCanadaWithLove
I've always wanted to observe two minute increments of the stream of consciousness of a raving lunatic #debatenight #dumptrump
Ohhh. All this time what America should have been doing was to actually colonize Iraq, and then voila! No isis. #sillybunts #debatenight
"I'll cut taxes but we're also a 3rd world country so I'll also build huge airports, hospitals, roads." debatenight
"Speaking of Law and Order it's a great show and I'm an investor. If I'm President I'll make sure we solve crimes in 1 hour." #debatenight
"That makes me smart." No, it means you've inherited a lot of your money. He's just like the rest of us. #1milliondollarloan #debatenight
I thought it was supposed to be Quiet during the #debatenight ..... I hope they throw them out !!!!
Other than the periodic ad, I haven't seen a single non-#DebateNight tweet in half an hour. The world is literally watching you, USA.
no president has ever been asked to released their emails before. Bush would have been in trouble. #debates
Awesome that they got Perd Hapley to moderate this clusterf**k of a debate. #debatenight #Debates2016
@realDonaldTrump he's your president too.  Respect for this country means accepting election results #Debates2016
i wish trump would shut his droopy ass mouth and let someone else talk for once #debatenight
#debatenight Hillary was partly behind cyber attacksby having a server in her basement.
Donald Trump is Donald Trumps greatest critic and he thinks he's great. In fact the best, believe me. #debatenight
Trump during debates sounds like me trying to write an essay on a topic I know nothing about aka rambling about irrelevant side topics
Since when has Nuclear weapons been the biggest threat to the world? 1982? #debatenight
"You know what else I prepared for? Being POTUS."  YAAAAASSSSSSS. #Shuthimdown #debatenight #ImWithHer
He asked about home grown terrorism and they talkin bout isis and oil and overseas terrorism. Y'all see this, right? #Debates2016
#debates   I wouldn't trust Trump to run a paper route moreless my country!
Listening to Trump makes me so sad that anyone in this country would buy his crap. #debatenight #Debates2016
Hilary's talking point on Trump's business manner  Valid...  And Trump just called that soundbites...  Looool #debatenight
Trump just inadvertently admitted he hasn't paid taxes in years! Whoa... #debatenight
I once had an Afrin addiction (FACT CHECK THAT @nani119), I think Trump is on the same tip. *sniff, sniff* #Debates2016
#debatenight  Did he just say people are killed by guns?? Did The Donald just ask for gun control?
#debatenight HOW IS THIS DOUCHE AT THE PODIUM RIGHT NOW I'M SO MAD AT #MERICA. TEMPERAMENT? REALLY?!
His buildings in Chicago and investments in North Carolina says African Americans and Hispanic people stop frisk blah blah! #debatenight
It's like watching to see which one of them is going to kill us the fastest #debatenight
Trump only cares about his business and every comment is a plug-in #Debates
Is he eventually going to answer one of these #debatenight questions? Almost an hour in, &amp; he hasn't actually answered any questions yet.
Personally I don't care what his taxes are or whether he pays them he's given millions of people jobs! #Debates2016
Watched the debates for a few minutes and could only think.."damn I can't believe this is real" smh
I want you to get onto answering the questions presented to you @realDonaldTrump DonaldTrump! #debatenight
We're gonna get a LOT of HIllary GIFs out of this moment #debatenight
#debates Hillary "we will use the delete key like no one else and it will keep our cyber security safe"
Stop and Frisk was deemed UNCONSTITUTIONAL! @realDonaldTrump is clueless &amp; not friend of minorities! #debatenight
“I haven’t given lots of thoughts to NATO” —Donald  What does that even mean? #Debates #DebateNight
"Just listen to what you just heard." - Next president of the United States of America #debates
Wait. Trump *may* have been to the third world countries he's exploiting to make his clothing line. #notmadeintheusa #debatenight
Neither candidate should be commenting on CS issues without being better prepared. #Debates
How long til he drops the formality of Secretary Clinton and brings out the Crooked Gillary? #debates
How long til he drops the formality of Secretary Clinton and brings out the Crooked Hillary? #debates
Trump’s “Why not?”response to Hillary saying she’ll be blamed for everything is the perfect summary of this election. #debatenight
HE KNOWS HOW TO WIN? He doesn't even know how to answer to these questions! #debatenight
Trump actually thinks Black Americans are HAPPY he forced @BarackObama to show his birth certificate!! #DebateNight #Debates #Debates2016
So are you saying we need Detective Olivia Benson, Donald Trump? #lawandorder #debates
Trump is just so uneducated in everything he says. Aka dumb. #debates #wedontneedanotherGeorgeW #PresidentialDebate
Trump's creating his own demise. Continue to dig your grave Donald. Show America the ass we all know you to be. #debates#PresidentialDebate
"we need law and order" translation: war on drugs pt 2 #Debates2016
Trump is a liar. 80% of those stopped in NYC were Black and Latino -- 92% innocent... #Debates2016
Security and foreign affairs... This is where she should win big... #Debates2016
You know both of these candidates are being so careful with their words when answering this question. #race #Debates
#debatenight "literally your whole entire life. Jobs jobs jobs. It would be beautiful"
"I haven't given much thought to NATO" - this guy wants to be president!!!! #debatenight
"I have a much better temperament than her" .... oh my FUCKING GOD. #debatenight
*Trump finishes his 5 minute rant* "On to you, Secretary Clinton" Hillary smiles. Her ultimate charge is full. #debates
*Trump let's temper get the best of him and rambles for prolonged period of time* Closes with "I have a great temperament." #debatenight
and now Trump is saying the Fed is playing politics which is totally the bete noire of everyday Americans #debatenight
@politico tonites #Debates2016 Trump cont 2 attack Hillary - no substance no poise - just vacuous &amp; boastful. Troubling is an understatement
Trump is like me in 3rd grade when I kept getting sent to the principal for yelling out all my 10 year old thoughts. #debatenight
the fact that #Trump even entertained Obama was not born here is like 1 million red flags #debatenight #debates
I'm beginning to think Donald has never spent time in a third world country. #debates
I think @HillaryClinton is doing the best thing by letting him talk #debatenight
"Law" and "Order" are racist terms to tell minorities to kneel. #debatenight
Hillary is ten times the speaker Trump wishes he was. He has yet to directly tackle any relevant question. #debatenight
Is this a presidential debate or who can be more petty? 🙄 #Debates
So far the only person that has said anything concrete is Hillary. Donald hasn’t said one constructive thing all night! #debatenight
This "Tara" sounds like a bad person. We should put her in jail. #debatenight #debates
@chefjoseandres care to chime in about why you're not doing resto at @Trump DC?! #debatenight #Debates2016
694 million?! Bruh. You could be "rebuilding America" in more impactful ways than running for president on the pretenses of hatred. #debates
This is getting boring..but side note ran into Jesse Jackson &amp; AJ who use to host 106&amp;Park today on campus #Debates2016
trump- my 10yr old knows computers it's crazy   yeah my 14yr old nephew is an android developer. this is cybersecurity for godsake #debates
Hillary Clinton is the wrong person to ask about cyber security. #Debates2016
Trump just goes on and on. Are there any facts and numbers he can stick to ever? #Debates2016
Did he just imply that his 10yo has better computer skills than him? Maybe that's who's in charge of his twitter account #debatenight
Trump is not being a big boy.  He's leaning toward turd monkey. #debatenight
I've taken a drink every time Trump has said something ungrammatical and now I can't remember my name #Debates
Rule #1: you can't say "excuse me" when it's not your turn. #debatenight #Debates
"That is not the right temperament to be Commander in Chief." Consider listening, Donald -- this is free campaign reform advice! #Debates
Americans who think the deleting of her emails was deplorable and criminal  #debatenight
"Stop and frisk was found to be unconstitutional. It didn't do what it was supposed to do." -@HillaryClinton #Debates2016
"You know what else I prepared for? I prepared to be president, and I think that's a good thing." -@HillaryClinton #Debates2016
Cluck! Trump: Clinton doesn't want to use the words "Law &amp; Order" #Debates2016 #DebateNight #BOOM
This is the best point by Hillary so far zero for the american public no taxes paid #debatenight
What the hell with trump's boy; I thought he would say that he cracked cyber security, but finally he said a different thing. #debatenight
Trump says if he doesn't pay taxes it's because "I'm smart." #PSLive #debatenight
HRC: gun epidemic is the "leading cause of death" for young black men #PSLive #debatenight
I don't feel like either of the candidates can truly address racial issues #Debates2016
"We have to knock the hell out of Isis and we have to do it fast" - Trump #debatenight
We aren't feeding all of our children, but it's our airports that prove we are living in the third world... #DebateNight
#debatenight #debates "We've got the address the systemic racism in our criminal justice system" 👏👏👏 thank you  Hillary Clinton!
Why would his lawyer tell him not to release his returns? #debatenight
I can name them all day long because I studied the maps before this debate. #debatenight
When Trump breaks in on Hillary, he does make it more entertaining - but he also saves her by accident, cutting off the drone  #debates
What Donald just did with the mic was wrong, this is part of the don'ts that he keeps doing! #DebateNight
You guys, I can't stand much more of this. The worst part of it is that people are going to believe him.  #debatenight #DownwithTrump
Clinton's just chilling while Trump tries to prove he said Iraq was a bad idea. #debates
"Been fighting ISIS your entire adult life." I didn't know this #Debates2016 would be a comedy.
You sure that was ICE and not ISIS that just endorsed you @realDonaldTrump ?  #debatenight #Debates2016
How is it possible there are 3 more debates after this one
Implicit bias Yes is is a societal problem...even in some black people  #debatenight
The woman who took money from private prisons wants to see them ended?!  Ok. #debatenight
Trump wants "to look" at the terrorist watch list and guns. #2A #debatenight
That's #Trump comeback after #Hillary just said how he stiffs the little guy #debatenight
Trump: I haven't discriminated in years. I'm very proud of that.  #debatenight
Trump you don't work for NBC anymore stop plugging Law and Order. #DebateNight #Debate
Man @HillaryClinton  is right, we can’t just say Law and Order! We need to specify SVU. plz #debatenight
It doesn't make you smart to avoid paying taxes. It makes you privileged, entitled, and quite possibly, fraudulent. #Debates2016
"You know what else I prepared for? Being President of the United States."   MIC DROP. #debatenight
Clinton really needs to come up with a catchy two-word phrase that matches up against "law and order" #debatenight #WEAADebates
Listening to Trump 'splain himself out of birther mvmnt like watching Joe Pesci snort coke &amp; babble in Goodfellas #debatenight #WEAADebates
Calling it now: this debate is not going to change anyone's minds or convert undecided. Both displaying their worse tendencies. #debatenight
Sad the majority of Americans is voting out of fear 🙄 #Debates2016 #debatenight
🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏  Come on Hillary Clinton.    Venga Hillary Clinton.  #debatenight  #ImWithHer
"[The black community] has been abused and used to gain votes" he speaks the truth. #debatenight
i throw way better temper tantrums them her - accurately misheard #debates
Why didn't the Hallmark Channel do the Kitten Debates, we all needed this ok #Debates2016
We need real debates. Not just including @GovGaryJohnson, but we need actual discussion, not made up facts, name calling and interruptions.
#debatenight stop and frisk...searching black people on the streets. That's going to go well. Lol
I do agree with Trump that we need Law &amp; Order in this country. Especially SVU #Debates2016
Hillary: Stop and frisk bad. Guns bad. Don't use stop and frisk to stop guns. #debatenight
#Debates2016 Lester Holt asks about racial issues then asks about birth certificate. Does anyone ask why it took POTUS 5 yrs to give it.
Africans don't know what an inner city is. We are tired of this #debatenight. 3:05 am already and its over in 25 minutes. No real issues
"I have a feeling that by the end of the evening I'm going to be blamed for everything that's ever happened." #Debates
I want the person who controls the nukes to be able to say the word 'terror'. #Debates2016
#debatenight Mr. Trump, do you pay zero federal tax?  "That makes me smart." ~Trump
Hey Donald, everybody else believed President Obama was born in America. That's why no one was interested in seeing his BC. #debatenight
Trump isn't wrong.  These countries really are like kids who take a $20 from their dad to buy a pizza and keep the change. #Debates2016
Tell him Lester!! The IRS says it's okay to release your returns!  #Debates2016
Presidential debates would be 100x better if the candidates talked super fast like they do in competitive debates.
#Debates2016 #Debates That feeling when @TheDemocrats side with GOP “national security” “leaders” who brought us 9/11, Iraq War/endless war.
@chrislhayes how does that help fred and Wilma in Kansas? it doesn't. #debatenight
"Charlotte, a city I love. A city where I have investments" #debatenight
Trump can't respect the moderator. How is he gonna respect the people and our country? #debate #debatenight
Bernie did get fucking raped and rigged out of the process but you're still a racist pig Trump #debatenight
Can we just have a burlap sack draped over a broom moderate the next debate? #debates
Trump: We are in a big fat ugly bubble.  Me: You mean your bloated fucking head? #debatenight #debates #Debates2016
Nah scary white police officers are the leading cause of death of black men #debatenight
"Obama should've produced his birth certificate earlier." Did other presidents have to produce their birth certificates? #debatenight
I would kill to see whatever doodle he's doodling right now while she speaks. #debates
"What do you say abut racial healing?" "I say nothing".... Thanks, @reaDonaldTrump #debates
Trumps plan--I ain't paying for shit but I will sure the rest of you do #debatenight
Thank you @LesterHoltNBC for bringing up the tax returns. But MAKE him answer! #Debates2016
I wonder how long all the networks had to meet to determine the color and width of the line separating the screen in the #DebateNight
So @astrotwins - how can the Blue Tied Gemini can get his composure back cause it seems the Red Scorpion is doing her worst. #Debates2016
Thank God I've got 4 cousins in Canada .If trump wins I'm moving to Toronto ! #DebateNight this guy is ignorant . #PrayForAmerica
The only reason the emails are still a thing is so that no one really finds out the truth about The Clinton Foundation #debatenight
Trumps right you know. We are a third world country. Patriotism keeps people from seeing it. He's also not the solution. #debatenight
Terrible moderation during #debatenight The birth certificate question is pointless when we look at what's at stake here.
It was not a mistake, it was purposeful. Hillary had an intent to break the law. #Debates
Did Trump just say he is proud of owning a club that allows black people in?  #debates
Trump: I made a racist claim and won. My opponents aid made a racist claim and lost! #debatenight #debates #Debates2016
"Donald supported the invasion of Iraq:" -- Clinton "Wrong... wrong" -- Trump Right, actually #debates2016
I'm doing an assignment where I identify fallacies in the candidates arguments and this is way too easy #debatenight
@BrookingsInst what are the racial breakdown of crimes committed? That's a comparison that needs to be used alongside this #debatenight
is 800 billion eveen thay much to you, Mr. Small Loan of a Milllion Dollars?? @realDonaldTrump #debatenight
It's already hard growing up as a Black Male in America so we don't need Trump 💯 #debatenight
Mainstream media person is lying...?ok @realDonaldTrump the fact remains that you LOVE the media n YOU endorsed the war...#debatenight #lies
"It's all words. It's all sound bites." -- the man who lacks any detailed, pragmatic policy proposals #debatenight
Did he just imply that his 10-year-old son, who probably only plays Minecraft, could hack a national committee? #debatenight
I've prepared for these debates and I've prepared to be President and I think that's a good thing.- Hillary Clinton
so many people getting heated out here like it concerns them lmao #debatenight #yallarestupid
#Trump says he will release his taxes once the audit is complete.  #debates #debatenight
#DebateNight Yes Mr. Trump, that's what we need--the 1 per cent of the stinking rich --your golden elite--running the country.
#DebateNight Clinton has the guts to say that gun violence is a big problem in the USA.
And the FOP, Admirals, Generals and everyone you're listing aren't racist or didn't create a mess? #Debates2016
"Stop and Frisk" didn't work well for those who were stopped and frisked.  #debatenight #debates #Debates2016 #PresidentialDebate
#DebateNight Yeah, nuclear weapons are the most serious, immediate threat but what shld be done to halt proliferation and reduce n-risks?
"Had we taken the oil, ISIS would not have been able to form" Bozhe moi. #Debates
Why does he want to help people get of the terror watch list? #Debates2016
Oh no...two old white people are about to talk about race #Debates2016 take cover
Now it's gonna get bad. I'm cringing waiting for his response #Debates
What happened to talking about race? I guess it's easier to talk about guns... #debates
People who have been most harmed by the criminal justice system are the people with the solutions #jobsnotjails #booksnotbars #debatenight
"I get audited almost every year" Hm maybe because you're a con artist and the IRS knows it? 🤔🤔🤔#Debates
The United States is nowhere near a third-world country. Pay your taxes, Trump...just like EVERYONE ELSE! #debatenight
Which one do we need, Donald? Law &amp; Order: SVU or Law &amp; Order: Criminal Intent?! #debatenight
get yourself a girl that looks at you the way HRC looks at Trump... wait no thats just the way any girl has ever looked at me #DebateNight
"Maybe he's not as rich as he says he is...or as charitable?"-@HillaryClinton #debatenight #debates
the only thing Trump has more audits than is draft deferments #Debates
"That's how I feel. Truly. That is how I truly feel." @realDonaldTrump #debates #debatenight #Debates2016
#Debates2016 we have to take out ISIS @HillaryClinton - @HillaryClinton formed under POTUS and @HillaryClinton
When @realDonaldTrump is talking now @LesterHoltNBC interrupts - clear implicit bias on display #Debates2016
I like calling him out on crazy so directly. But does that work? Or is it a gambit? #debates
Back to the "law and order" approach... wonder what that means, so all cops are justified for killing unarmed people. #debatenight #debates
Trump won't say Russia tries to cyber attack the USA. China and other places. But not Russia. #debatenight
Like I said, pre-debate:  Trump will run out of gas and lose in the last half hour.  Voila.   #debatenight
Trump: that's the way I feel. That is truly the way I feel.        @birbigs did trump watch "my girlfriend's boyfriend" #debates
Quoting Michelle. More points! "Go low. Shawty, I go high" while I bring up your racist past. #debatenight
This is amazing television. Not often do we get to see a man disemboweled on national TV. #debatenight
I motion to cancel the remaining debate and hold the election next Tuesday. Do I have a second? #debatenight
Trickle down didn't work the first time, Trump. Stand up for small business! Increase taxes for the 1%! #debates
Exactly!! RT @shondarhimes: OMG, can you imagine this dude in a meeting with ANY other world leader? #Debates2016
#Debates2016 @HillaryClinton don't stoop to @realDonaldTrump level! Don't do zingers stay true to self. @realDonaldTrump stop interrupting
We are in a bubble! Trust me! I’ve profited off of several bubbles in the past! #debatenight
Ethiopia’s government is shooting people for wanting food and infrastructure so yes America is a third world country. #debatenight
Don't worry folks: he also fit some fat shaming into his nonsense #debatenight
Girl, you know you wanted to scratch your face with a different finger. #debatenight #hillary
#DebateNight I look at Hillary and I see a president. I look at Donald and I see a minor league player struggling to play in the majors.
I can agree with trump on this... I'm really OK with bringing back Law &amp; Order. SVU just isn't the same. #debatenight
#debatenight He's proud of settling a racial discrimination lawsuit with no admission of guilt?
"We have to bring back Law &amp; Order" I miss that show too Donald. #debates2016
"It's all words... It's on occasion, four times.. I take advantage of the laws of the nation." #debatenight
"It could be someone sitting on their bed who weighs 400 lbs" now we know what #trump thinks about hackers &amp; the cyber #debatenight
Donald what countries you do business with?  #conflict of interest  #Debates
Wow, Hillary really gamed this out well, has left every issue framed the way she wants... #debatenight
Can't wait to hear Donald Trump talk about Lester Holt favoring Hillary #debatenight
Can someone explain why her emails were so important?? Please  #debatenight
What if Trump was really poor and that's the reason as to why he won't release his tax returns 🤔🤔 #DebateNight
Can we get back to actual issues rather than he is worse/she is worse? @LesterHoltNBC #debatenight
NW: #debatenight  #DonaldTrump vs #HillaryClinton (Hillary FTW!! She sounds more sincere and accurate!)
Trump: "I have much better judgment than Clinton because I have much better judgment" #debatenight #tytlive
I can't wait to talk about GSA Schedules and defense acquisition in this debate! #Debates2016
So @realDonaldTrump thinks it is 'smart' to pay zero for troops, zero for schools, zero for food stamps. #DebateNight
If Trump mentions the refugees as a security problem I will lose it. #debatenight
Seems pretty clear that Trump's strategy is not to target women tonight... #debatenight
Trumps unlikeability just spiking throughout the night! This debate is like a street fight! #debatenight
Every parent of toddlers knows how Lester Holt feels right now #Debates2016
Pleading the fifth only works if you're being persecuted for a crime. Almost always, witnesses have to testify. #debatenight #factcheck
Criminals won't care about your gun laws and give them away #debatenight
"Join the debate by saying more crazy things" @HillaryClinton (I think this is the tip of #trumpedupTrickleDown! #Debates2016
And he just lost it by called the United States of America a 3rd world country.  #wtf #debatenight
Nothing like two wealthy old White people debating the racial struggle. #debatenight
bernie sanders coulda been up there grillin donald trump but nooooo y'all wanna pick hilary. #debatenight
#DonaldTrump wants some credit for things a normal man just does, like not discriminating against minorities. #debatenight @chrisrock
In Hillary Clinton's mind, black communities are both thriving and ruthlessly hunted by racist cops. #debatenight
Why does anyone care what Hillary thinks about law? She failed the bar exam. Hardly anyone does that. #debatenight
@LesterHoltNBC- We are so far behind schedule why did I let them talk this long #tytlive #debatenight
How is your vote a question with the juxtaposition in front of you right now? #ImWithHer #debatenight
"That makes me smart" - Trump says he is smart for not paying taxes.  #Debates
Trump just painted hackers as guys in their beds that weight 400lbs. #debates
#debatenight is more like date night, I'd pay $100 to give them both an extra minute to talk at each other. It makes me laugh, nervpusly
Whoa.   Is this new info about DoJ suing Trump over not renting to Blacks? #Debates2016
hillary: go to my website, to see how w- donald: check out mine too!!! why is he that five year old that can't find any chill? #debatenight
WTF is wrong with our political process that we don't think Gary Johnson belongs on this stage? #debatenight #HofstraDebate
"I want to  get on to things that are very important to the country." ~Trump So, Pres. Obama's birth cert is as imp as jobs? #debatenight
Did he just admit that he doesn't pay income tax?  "That makes me smart". #Debates2016 #taxreturns
Twitter war!!  CLINTON SHINES AND TRUMP GETS TRUMPED UP  #Debates2016
Perhaps we should open a for profit mental hospital specifically for Trump supporters, it's clear they're damaged #debatenight #debatenight
@debates Really!? This is a presidential debate? Wow. WTF. I have to say, insightful questioning.
Hmmm do you guys think that Trump is REALLY answering Lester's questions??? Or is he just ranting? Let's go with ranting #debatenight
The best candidates going head to head in this Jerry springer-esc debate. Great moves. Keep it up. Proud of you. Papa bless. #debatenight

@realDonaldTrump has his way I know Clinton has gave info to our enemies he also wants the middle class to go down  #Debates
Trump: nuclear armament is the world's single greatest threat, not global warming. #debates #debatenight
Clinton: "I have no arguments, so i criticize the person who has that"  #debatenight
Education and infrastructure is what will help inner city communities, not politicians virtue signaling to them #debatenight #Debates2016

You can release your taxes even if you're under audit. Literally no one is falling for that  #debates
Crazy, I know... that we make ourselves stronger, so we can then assist other counties even more in the future. #Debates
They aren't paying their fair share????? YOU JUST SAID U DONT PAY FED TAXES I guess that makes them smart too #debatenight  #Debates2016
Why does he keep bringing up Obama? What about you, what are you going to do???? #debatenight #PresidentialDebate

Can't say I've ever flown into Dubai's airport. Could be an income thing. #debates
Go with what has been effective, like gun free zones that don't work @HillaryClinton  #debates
Whenever @realDonaldTrump says "believe me," it means he is about to vomit falsehoods. #debates
"i take responsibility" - @HillaryClinton GOOD that's something i want a president to say #debates
"No wonder you've been fighting ISIS your entire adult life" didn't know ISIS has been around 50+ years ??? #Debates2016
Trumps constant sniffing evokes memories of 1980's NY toilet stalls around Wall Street #debatenight #debates #Debates2016
all talk not action never gonna work why is trump describing himself? #debates
@HillaryClinton why say no ground troops against ISIL? Why take off the table critical tools the country has to defeat enemies?#debatenight

Hope everyone is tuned in to #debatenight ! Trump and Clinton are currently discussing race relations
I think we can all agree that @LesterHoltNBC is the real loser in this debate. #debatenight
My husband: you should do this, this way Me: wrong...Wrong.   My new way to argue inspired by #debatenight #Debates2016
#Debates Trump spreads fear like disease with him as cure. He’s the placebo! Elect him and we die. #TheTrumpPlacebo
a dig at MCC in #oitnb - no more profit driven prison systems in our country. #clinton #debates
Flip back to a 2012 Debate, and you'll find the same conversation. These are not new ideas. Just copied and pasted words. #Debates
"I have a better temperament than she does" - Trump #ImWithHer  #debatenight #Debates2016
Donald's going to snort that mic whole before #Debates2016 is over. Is he hyperventilating?
@realDonaldTrump says US airports are from a third world country, @HillaryClinton wants him to pay income taxes to fix it #debates
I'm so over Donald Trump. He never answers a question straight. #debatenight
you know this election is a joke when the audience sounds like the laugh track on sitcoms #Debates2016
"Politicians like secretary clinton have caused this problem" MY BOI GETTING ON HER ASS.  #debatenight #Debates2016

'I will bring back jobs, you will not bring back jobs' - Trump to Clinton #debatenight  #Debates2016
@HillaryClinton mentions mental health issues with best example to her immediate right.  #debatenight
My first year to vote and this is who I get🙄😭 #debatenight
He refused to pay them. Is that what we call smart too? #debatenight  #InterruptingTrump
Someone is finally deleting the Trump Tweets that have been proof of his lies all these months. Took them long enough #debatenight
@realDonaldTrump lets think about all the terrible things you say but oh wait, character count #debatenight
Oh here we go with the taxes !!!!!! 😂😂😂😂 are you Trump Trolls can go to bed now. #debatenight
Yes police are implicitly bias !!!! Why am I afraid to leave my damn house.  #debatenight
Donald Trump keeps sniffing like he's allerigic to his own bullshit #debatenight
My opinion is that Trump is doing terribly. Whether true or not I don't know as facts stopped mattering in 2016. #debatenight
@realDonaldTrump what about the race discrimination at your rallies? I'm just asking man.  #debatenight
Hillary actually stared blankly into the camera for about 10 seconds while he spoke LOL. #breakingthe4thwall #Debates2016
Is Marco Rubio under Donald's podium filling up his water glass? #ThirstyDonald #debatenight #WhereIsGary #LetGaryDebate
When Trump has to shut up I put my hands over my eyes because it looks like he's about to go full Bilbo Baggins Scary Face. #Debates2016
Is anybody watching Trumps hair piece. All that money he got lol. Poor racoon lol #debatenight # So Sad Lol
Trump just condemned Hillary for "superpredator." HE'S calling HER out for name-calling? Chutzpah. . #Debates2016
Trump is randomly babbling military terms and names of countries. Free association.  #debatenight
MY DOG JUST DIED Trump: Lets blame Clinton so we can trun the attention away from the fact that I haven't made a valid point... #debatenight
So the security aspect of Cyber is very very tough, and hardly doable. Someone better found a startup. #debatenight
Hillary has the same patient expression as a grade school teacher listening to a kid try and cover a lie #Debates
Gotta say, it may be a lesser platform, but the #Debates are where @twitter really shines.
I think we can call this debate now unless Hillary passes out. #debatenight
Not that it means anything, but I chuckle about Trump's inflection of AFRICAN-American.  #DebateNight
What does Obama being a citizen have to do with race?  #DebateNight
Hey, @mtaibbi , any thoughts on all the things Clinton has blamed 2008 fall on so far without mentioning banks/Glass-Steagall? #debatenight
Come on Hillary with 1,2 👊👊. He's not that rich or charitable!  #debatenight
According to Lying Trump, Stop &amp; Frisk was ruled unconstitutional, because the judge was a "very against police" judge. #Lies #debates
They use slave labor in all 3 countries that he talked their airports! #nevertrump #debates2016 #voteblue
Terrorist attacks have been taking place on American soil long before Daesh looking at #KKK &amp; other racist groups #nevertrump #debates2016
"They talk good" I swear to god Donald you need to learn fucking English #debatenight

I never thought fatshaming hackers would ever be a part of the #debatenight #ImWithHer
Take a shot every time Trump interrupts Hilary during her 2 minutes #debatenight
So, NATO has to "pay their fair share," but the wealthy don't? #debatenight
"I have a better temperament," says the man who's been yelling and interrupting even the moderator for over an hour. #debatenight
i'm having flashbacks to the leslie knope and bobby newport debate #debatenight
Has Hillary built anything or created or just lived off others hard work? #debatenight
Working with community, is tired  , quit it. Dems had made no impact. #debatenight
Trump is going to get his NRA rating dropped due to this. #debatenight
Wait he just said 3,000 shootings, and then right after said 4,000 deaths by shootings???? MAKE UP YOUR MIND. #Debates
"A man who gets upset from a tweet should not have access to nuclear codes" #yes #debatenight
Donald Trump is a con man for not answering a question directly and he want to be the President of United State. #DebateNight
For the love of God!! someone give him a tissue PLEASE! I don't want to see him wipe it on his sleeve  #debatenight #Debates2016
How can anyone vote for this man? Don't answer that. It would make me too sad. #debatenight
Lester: Admit you fucked up about birtherism Trump: Wolf Blitzer. Kenya. Pressing it. Birth certificate. ISIS.  #debatenight
Donald is struggling. All his weaknesses coming out when faced with facts. #debatenight
Really? Stop and frisk is the solution to address the killing of African Americans? Who are "these people"? #debatenight
Donald Trump wants 'to get on with defeating ISIS' yet he spent FIVE years pontificating around Obama's birth certificate. #DebateNight
2004 MoU between Kerry &amp; Bush facilitated by CPD   "The parties agree that they will not (1) issue any challenges for additional debates,"
Honestly, I don't understand half the shit that comes out of Trumps mouth  #debatenight
When is going to be on Netflix? That way I can watch this when I have the time #debatenight
See tweets about taxes. Really? All this shit going on and taxes are what people are talking about  #debatenight
That's the Trump card: you release your 33,000 emails. I'll release my Tax returns. #debatenight #DonaldTrump #HillaryClinton
Trump keeps saying we need Law and Order?? He wants another Law and Order series??? #debatenight
Trump would cross the street if a black dog walked towards him #debatenight
So @HillaryClinton looks about as furious as I am about @realDonaldTrump talking about stop and frisk. #debatenight
He apparently doesn't frequent airports at many 3rd world countries. Pretty sure the ones I've seen were worse than Laguardia.  #debatenight
#debatenight I love the fact that Hillary Clinton owned up to her mistake. #33,000mails That one thing Trump can't do..
It doesn't work that way? IT DOESN'T WORK THAT WAY??? Dude. Guess what? Neither does lying about the presidents birth country. #Debates2016
Answer the question. This question. The one he just asked. Today. In your two minutes. Ok? #DebateNight
Oh yeah, blame Hillary for all the things she has no control over. That'll show her. (Please note sarcasm) #Debates
idk man i dont agree with trump here when he says to bring back law and order like psych is the best procedural cop show #debates
@HillaryClinton you need to wake up...get a little angry at this jagoff #Debates2016
If I hear one more "no", "you're wrong", "no, it didn't" not followed by a coherent argument out of Trump's mouth…🙄 #DebateNight
@realDonaldTrump you said Hillary was out of control have you seen your twitter!!! #debatenight
#debatenight @realDonaldTrump Birther through and through and through. "I think I did a good job" as a Birther

#StongerTogether #debatenight #itsalie @realDonaldTrump Uh, we have laws against Stop and Frisk. Are all Judges a daddy issue for you?
I like how Trump always says "long time" whenever he has no clue how long ago something actually happened. #Debates2016
#Millenials are going to have a lot to clean up after a couple of years #Debates
How can Hillary bring up airstrikes so flagrantly? Why would we add gas to the flame. She may have the better rationality but no #debates
Despite the tweet deleting frenzy of his peeps, Trump still hasn't realized that the Internet is written in ink.  #debates #debatenight
I can't believe he's trying to perpetuate these lies about the unconstitutional 'stop &amp; frisk' tactics that stigmatize communities #debates
TRUMP ON EMAILS: "You have staff members taking the 5th?  That's disgraceful and this country thinks its disgraceful!" #debates
He don't care about use. He study showing shots at ppl #Debates

#Debates2016 NY had 2262 murders in 1990, 352 in 2015. Number of guns owned by Americans has increased by 10s of millions in that time.
"I get audited by the IRS, but other people don't!" Doesn't that sound good. #debatenight

Glad Trump built that nice hotel on Pennsylvania Ave, he'll have a great view when Hillary moves back into the White House #Debates2016
@realDonaldTrump is passionate because he believes in our country he is fighting like hell for us. #Debates
If you're having a bad night, think about Lester Holt right now #debates
The problem with someone who incessantly says "believe me" is that you start to wonder why they have to keep saying that 🤔 #Debates2016
I can't believe I'm saying this but I think @MittRomney would have wiped the floor with both of them. #debatenight
It always goes back to his businesses and investments. We get it @realDonaldTrump. Now answer the question. #debatenight #Debates2016

He's asking you why you changed your mind on your opinion on where he was actually born ... #DebateNight
Trump -- I thought it was loud breathing, but #sniffles is trending. So is he sick, or did he just do a line? #debatenight
These two dimwits have just made Gary Johnson the front-runner.  #Debates
He derides Clinton for using her 5th amendment right but beats the drum on the 2nd being sacrosanct #debatenight #hisownreality

The FOP endorsed Trump.  How do they feel about him thinking it's smart not to have to help pay our police? #debatenight
"I made a mistake". Martha Stewart made a mistake. Snowden made a mistake. The Rosen's made a mistake. #debatenight
Oh yeah because I definitely want a guy that says he'll disobey professionals and authority as president #debatenight
Trump will also be recruiting people who play Call of Duty to fight ISIS, since they're good at guns.  #debatenight
everytime Trump says Clinton take a shot. i'm gonna be wasted #Debates
I'm waiting for Lester to lose his shit and be like,   "Now look, damnit. I said it was Hilary's turn. Now shut the fuck up!" #debatenight
Way to go Lester Holt! Stop &amp; Frisk, unconstitutional, racial profiling. #Debates2016 #debatenight

How can Hillary for job when she do not support coal mining #debatenight @jstines3
Why should we hear either of their plans to fight Isis? Shouldn't that be a Military General's job? #debatenight
Trump just accidentally admitted he hasn't paid taxes! He didn't even realize it. 😂 #Debates2016 LoveTrumpsHate
"China should go into North Korea" China is FRIENDS with North Korea! RUSSIA is FRIENDS with North Korea! Dafuq u talkin' about?  #Debates

#Debates LMAO ALL THIS NIGGAS ARE BEHIND CLINTON ABOUT SAVING THERE LIFE'S,YOU WILL BE SO DISSAPOINTED I CANT WAIT
This is pretty much not even a fair fight. She doesn't need to go to another one, it's way beneath her. #debatenight #debates
@HowardStern was not on our Bingo card. Really didn't see that one coming. #debates
Did Trump just confirm he doesn't pay federal income tax? "That makes me smart." #Debates
Hillery is just letting him go. Dig his own hole. Deeper and deeper. #debatenight
.@CampbellForLA remind us again who you are supporting for POTUS? Like the Donald's logic, we can't seem to follow it. #lasen #debatenight
I don't think I ever laughed as hard in my life than I have tonight 😂#debatenight

@FoxNews @realDonaldTrump @HillaryClinton Trump admitting that FOX is not mainstream but Right of Attila the Hun #debates

SOS: 8% battery with 37 minutes remaining in the debate! 🙃🙃🙃 #Debates2016
he's like a child when you confront them with the truth but they insist that you're wrong #debates
Dammit everyone, this is where I went to escape the debates. Stop it
Only notable tax return issue re: Presidents was #Hillary getting deduction for Bill's dirty old underwear #Cheap #Debates2016 #NeverHillary
Clinton: "I feel like I'm going to be blamed for everything that ever happened." Trump: "Why not?" #debates #debatenight
Trump: I can write you a list of words I know. Does Hilary know that many words? I don't know...  #debatenight
Trump is like that girlfriend on Seinfeld who constantly talked over people and then asked why she was interrupted  #debatenight
#debatenight I've had sex with as many women as specific, actual answers @realDonaldTrump has given.  Zero. The answer is zero. By the way.
@GrahamKates @AdamWeinstein On Iraq: “Yeah, I guess so,” Trump responded. “I wish the first time it was done correctly.” #debatenight
Now we're going to talk about Googles, dangerous Skype funded Googles. #debatenight
What a damnable liar this Lester is. Terry v. Ohio was not declared unconstitutional. #debatenight
DT: I have common sense  Me: People let's start a search party!! We must find his common sense.  #debatenight
Our country is screwed no matter what way you vote  #debatenight
#debates  #debates2016 speaking of Stern, trump fans like to talk about those supposed Muslims Cheering on 9/11, now he was against the war?
#debates  #debates2016  "We can't support Japan" well now he is against anime, He lost my vote
Did Trump just admit to discrimination but say it was ok cuz others did it too #Debates2016 #msnbc
"That's for sure, " @LesterHoltNBC already admonished interruptions from the peanut gallery #debatenight
I was miffed when folk kept calling #obama "articulate." @realDonaldTrump proves how uncommon and laudable that is. #debatenight
Does anyone actually think Obama is going to leave the White House and just play golf for the rest of his life? #debatenight
#debatenight I guess I missed where Trump was a politician and had a say in the Iraq war.
He actin like he ain't gonna leave us in the dust if he wins (God Forbid 🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾) #debatenight
So if we're just unsatisfied with outcomes, we just ignore our end of the deal? @realDonaldTrump #Debates2016
At no point did Trump answer the question there. Just a rehash of his theories on Isis. And - we should have kept the oil?! #Debates2016
FACT CHECKERRRRRRRRRRS... TURN UP THE VOLUME! (Sounds like a football cheer, yes?) #debatenight
Oh for goodness sakes... stop the debate and stop sniffing @realDonaldTrump! Allergy medicine. #EMAC2k16 #debates #debatenight
I'm jumping out of my seat laughing and yelling too many times #debatenight
"Everyone should be respected by the law and everyone should respect the law." @HillaryClinton #Debates2016
#DonaldDeplorable is now rambling. I don't even know what he's talking about... #Debates2016
Trump says if he hasn't paid a single $1 in taxes, "that makes me smart." #Debates2016
"Was it Russia? We don't know it was Russia. Some of my best friend's are Russia!" #debatenight
Fun game: Take a shot every time Donald says wrong, China or excuse me #debatenight @HillaryClinton @realDonaldTrump
Did he just "meh" when she said Trump is ignoring the vibrancy of Black communities? #debatenight
I just ate a bunch of cookies while watching debates in horror
"I have much better judgement than she does. There's no question. I also have a much better temperament" shouts Trump #Debates2016
He actually said "that makes me smart" about paying no taxes #debatenight
"No admission of liability"-That's a stock standard condition when you settle any lawsuit! Doesn't mean you did nothing wrong! #debates
I just wanna say that Newark Airport is p good, OK thank you #debatenight
It's definitely #buyLesterADrink tonight! Maybe Lester and Hillary can go out and chat about this mess of a #debates
NATO countries aren't paying their fair share, like rich people in America. #debatenight
4 years of looking at one of these assholes, if I didn't already have RDF, the thought of this would put me well on my way... #debatenight
#snort count 15+ #trump looks like an iguana  “uggghhh” says donald.  #Debates2016 #debates
.@HillaryClinton "You can pick it up at a book store or at an airport near you!" #debatenight #debates #sorrynotsorry
@realDonaldTrump can you please make a point??? Please I want to see your brilliance but you make it so hard #Debates
#debatenight #debates #Debates2016 He said "We need to knock the hell out of Isis and quick!"
Prediction: Trump drops his taxes online tonight. That burn from Hillary was third-degree. #Debates
Democracy is just wrong. allows some stupid people to vote for another stupids. Just happened in México and now in the US #Debates2016
#Debates #Debates2016 Hillary just issued another cowardly diversion statement because she can't handle being exposed as incompetent!
Cyber warfare topic. Meaning China and Russia is the next topic of this debate.😂 Heads up Pres. Duterte!😂 #debatenight
Hillary, who by operating a private email server exposed our secrets to the world, wants to talk security. Fuck off, cunt. #Debates2016
This is a prime example of what is wrong with our country.  #debatenight
When Trump tries to attack HRC's character he sounds like a complainy whiny baby. I can't believe he didn't say "so there". #debates
I simply can't believe Lester Holt hasn't said STFU already. #WhyICantModerateADebate #debates  #debatenight
Is it me or is Trump's NATO policy modeled after the Gambino crime family?  #debatenight #debates
Nothing like the debates to remind you that everyone has a political degree and knows what they're talking about!
next debate, we need to get someone a little stronger than lester bc he just lets donald walk all over him #debatenight
Stood up on my couch &amp; applauded when @HillaryClinton brought up the fact that Trumps been sued for racist acts. #DebateNight #ImWithHer
rump: "Stop and frisk is great." Moderator: "Stop and frisk was ruled unconstitutional." Trump: "No, you're wrong."   #debatenight
If your too dangerous to fly you to dangerous to have a gun for those on restricted flying because terror watch  #debatenight
When trump gets called out he talks around the shit  #debatenight
@realDonaldTrump didn't your mother ever tell you that it's rude to interrupt people when they're speaking? #DebateNight
Trump doesn't give a toss about the questions, he's just here to say what he wants #debatenight
"Many countries of NATO aren't paying their share," says the man that just said not paying taxes makes him smart. #Debates2016 #duh
@kzolson19 if you really think that we may be watching different debates
#debatenight for someone who isn't a racist @realDonaldTrump definitely sounds like one when referencing President Obama
Has a point about the "typical politician" -- All talk, no action. #trump #Debates2016
Blow your fucking nose man. Can you imagine if she was up there sniffling. His people &amp; media would be calling for paramedics #debatenight
Clinton just stated Trump hasn't paid Federal income tax to which he replied "that makes me smart".... I don't even.... #debatenight
He is kind of amazing ... everything starts with either I or me ... #DebateNight
Sitting here wondering what percentage of these statements Donald is just completely making up #debatenight
hillary go ahead &amp; release the emails girl to shut this motherfucker up, we wont judge if you sent your nudes out #debatenight
"They talk good around election time" Unlike me; I talk bad all the time #Debates
"All talk, no action. Sounds good. Not going to work," Trump says of Clinton's approach to jobs and economy.#debatenight #Debates2016
Did Trump really call out dilapidated bridges? Hope Chris Christie isn't watching! #DebateNight #Debates2016 #PresidentialDebate #ImWithHer
Systemic racism affects all people of color, incl blacks, Hispanics, &amp; American Indians. #ImWithHer #Debates2016 #PresidentialDebate
#Debatenight - A Summary Trump: buzz words, "facts", interrupting, name dropping Hilary: full sentences, mic drops, serious side eye
#Debates2016 Trump: I've been under audit for 15 years, I should be complaining, it's almost become a way of life
#debatenight Trump: African Americans &amp; Hispanics living in hell, walk down the streets you get shot. Asks himself if it's a war zone
#debatenight Clinton: a man provoked by a tweet should not have his hands near nuclear launch codes
why do people in america think they're going to take out ISIS/ but can't take out gangs here at home.  #Debates2016
But @realDonaldTrump you pushed it for years after the birth certificate. Liar! #debates #debatenight
Ever concerned about the needs of the poor, @realDonaldTrump is unhappy that "our airports are like a 3rd world country"  #debates
"Hillary dressed in the blood of the men who underestimated her." #PresidentialDebate #debatenight 😂😂😂😂
Why has Donald been audited for 15 years? That probably means you're doing something sketchy. #Debates2016
Lester needs to figure out how to count.....the true meaning of 20 seconds #debatenight
Stop and frisk is unconstitutional. That's it. Stop trying to justify the harassment of Black and Brown people. #Debates2016
No matter who becomes president in November, we the people lose.  Hillary and Trump are both corrupt arrogant morons #debates
: This #Debates2016 has now turned into a bad variety show skit. I'm waiting for Donald to say, "Live from New York, it'sSaturday Night..."
"Our airports are, like, from a third world country...we've become a third world country" words of wisdom fr. @realDonaldTrump #debatenight
Is #Trump admitting he's not as rich as he has been saying? #debatenight
@funnyordie I'm gonna build a wall of computers and make Mexico pay for it #debatenight
Thank you Jesus for @Twitter. I couldn't make it through #Debates2016 without some of y'all tonight.
The "Whooooo, Okay!!!!!" gif is about to become a classic. Mark my words.  #Debates2016
#Trump: "We have not been updating from a new standpoint." Huh?  #Debates2016
It's not even about gangs anymore it's about the fucking police #debatenight 😤
Hillary says we need to be cooperative? not be alienated? and not pushed away? ironic? #debatenight
Trump has no idea what the current policy about nuclear first use is #debatenight
"You're wrong", duckface expressions, and hundreds of hand gestures. That sums up the debate. #debatenight #debates #Debates2016
Let a teacher tell you. Law and order only goes so far. You create a community? Law and order will follow and maintain itself. #debatenight
What does having Admirals, Generals, ICE and Border Agent endorsements have to do with Cyber Security??? #debatenight
Bruh if Hilary doesn't start answering questions this will not go well 😪 #Debates
What an utter idiot. He's a playground bully and so unpresidential. #debates #ImWithHer
Those killing was going to happen whether Obama was in the chair or not. #DebateNight
Donald Trump has started the tantrums or is it tantrumps! "You have been fighting ISIS all your adult life." #debatenight #Debates2016
And don't forget addressing police force's mental health issues as well. #debatenight to
#debates make him stop! Stop &amp; frisk is not unconstitutional - what r u talking about???
It's like watching an adult trying to have a conversation with a toddler. #debatenight
hi it's me. the guy tweeting normal stuff during the debates
#debatenight Loud and Rude is Donald Trump's understanding of debate. He is a crude bully who mistakes bellicosity for policy statements.
ANOTHER BURN BY HILLARY! BLAME EVERYTHING ON ME? THEN DONALD COMES IN WITH THE WHY NOT? MY GOD THIS IS SO HYPE! #debatenight
I'm so disgusted by the fact that people exist who will knowingly vote for tr*mp. Gross. #debatenight
#debatenight Seems to me Trump likes to brag more about his company+how successful he is rather than focusing on the problems at hand.
@realDonaldTrump why do you always bring up weight when you clearly haven't stepped on treadmill in the last 40 years? #debatenight
@realDonaldTrump won't be happy until @HillaryClinton personally choke slams the leader of Isis #debatenight
Trump says he will release his tax returns when Clinton releases the deleted emails #debatenight
We do need Law &amp; Order because we have to hear "their stories" #debatenight
@KieraGorden I think he's sniffing some of Bill &amp; Hillary's finest Arkansas blow. #debatenight
Where the shit is Sanders right now? He should be on stage. #realtalk #Debates2016
#Debates I can't stand all the stupid smug faces Trump makes while watching Hillary.
I think trump has a little bit of Vicks under his nose that he keeps sniffing so he doesn't smell his own bullshit.#snifflegate #debatenight
#Trump is on something. You can see it on him.  Probably wasn't included in the letter from his doctor.  #DebateNight #Debates #ImWithHer
Lester, you tried to get Trump to respond directly to a question. Don't you know that's not his thing? #debatenight
HRC's ready, relaxed, slow smile-pivot to Lester for next question is... everything.  She's a goddamn inspiration. #debatenight
This #debates has been gooood. And I tought it was going to be a waste of time watching this.
Remember he said he knew more about ISIS than the generals? but now they all besties? What is real anymore? #debatenight
Turns out that murder is bad, thanks @realDonaldTrump and @HillaryClinton for clearing that up #debatenight
I love Donald's little comments into the mic while she's trying to talk. #favs #hilarious #debatenight
Thanks for spitting out the stupid random garbage that doesn't matter you hoe bag #debatenight #NeverHillary
Good deal! Hilary releases her thousands of deleted emails; Trump releases his tax returns! You're both hiding something 🇺🇸#Debates2016
Agreed #DonaldTrump! We do need Law and Order restored in our country or we won't have on 🇺🇸🙌🏾🇺🇸🙌🏾 #DebateNight #Debates2016
Trump will come off as channelling the anger of Americans who feel left behind by pols. Very difficult to fight that. Sadly. #debatenight
Well...I think now we know for sure that Trump doesn't know anything about "The Fed".  #debatenight #Debates2016 #trumpfails
But, if we can't count on the support of people we opposed in the primary, then Trump literally has no ticket.  #debatenight #trumpFails
Why do I feel like Trump is being given ALL the time ??! #DebateNight
Her husband's Three Strike Law ensured slavery in prisons for the profits of her buddies that prisons are corrupted and inflated. #debates
Nuclear Weapons are the single greatest single threat. Should other countries pay for protection? #debatenight #Debates2016
Trump doesn't get the different between a nation and a state. #debatenight
Hillary needs to get a little more assertive here.  There's an opening b/c Trump is losing it. #debatenight #debates
It's 2016. We have the technology to turn off microphones when it isn't your turn to talk😂 #debatenight
Trying to count how many times I say "Oh my god, just shut your mouth, Donald!" at my tv screen. I think it's up to 15 by now. #debatenight
Another time tonight that Trump has said he can "keep naming" various things, but names only one? #debatenight #debates #Debates2016
Race. @realDonaldTrump is going to crash and burn in 10, 9, 8.... #debatenight #Debates2016
Did this nut just try to blame Obama for Chicago violence?? He supports stop and frisk. Told y'all he's crazy...#debatenight #Debates2016
@realDonaldTrump needs to stop blaming Obama. He kicked your GOP party's tail twice. Let it go!!! #debatenight #Debates2016
"There are things we can do &amp; we should find a way to do it"  "What do you suggest?"  "That's not my job, fuck you"  #debates #debates2016
"Everyone should be respected by the law and respect the law" - Hillary #debatenight
This woman supports the war on drugs and talks about respect for the law? #Debates
Wow. It just got heavy. Racist. I wonder about the racists comments that came out of the DNC hacks. #Debates
“We should have taken the oil” - Trump on Iraq’s natural resources that definitely don’t belong to the US. #debatenight
HRC needs to be balls to the wall with this topic if she wants to win votes. Neutrality is a myth. #blacklivesmatter #debatenight
"I have a much better temperament than her." -The only candidate that's been screeching like a wild bitch the entire debate #debatenight
NOBODY WAS CARING ABOUT IT BECAUSE IT WAS NOT A FUCKING POINT. EVER. #debatenight
#DebateNight. Trump you are lying.  There is ZERO reason you can't release your taxes. Liar!
Ppl are being shot in the streets and starving to death in the United States but ur complaining about airports #debatenight
the incredible amount trump has shown toward lester holt is sickening #debates
I'm missing this debate sitting here waiting for a CT scan 😳. #Debates #ImWithHer
Hmmm. Hillary has been fighting ISIS all her life? She's younger than I thought. #debatenight #MomsDemandHillary #ImWithHer
Ya Donald we saw your house full of gold while our is falling in parts and we pay taxes EVERY YEAR !!! #debatenight
Yes Hilary redirect back to the question Trump jumps off the question because he has NO plans just rhetoric #Debates2016
Trump: "I have much better temperament." Comedy hour at the debate. Holy shit. #debatenight #Debates2016
If he paid his taxes maybe we would have some money. He only cares about himself and people like him. #debatenight
I pray for this country I am becoming less intelligent the more I watch #debates
Trump tries to say racism is too high and has gotten out of hand, yet he's been quoting white supremacists and clan members. #debatenight
I feel like I'm at the bar and I can't leave because this dude won't shut up for 5 seconds so I can say goodbye. #debatenight
"I take advantage of the laws"   Yeah, no kidding. #debatenight
I keep forgetting the balls Trump has until he just flat out says, "Nope, you're wrong." #debatenight
Wait a minute. I'm not sure this is @realDonaldTrump. This man's skin tone is a hue that's found in nature. #debates
I love #Trump redirecting questions. It shows how bad he's getting burned tonight. #debatenight #HillaryClinton #Hillary
#Debates2016 do you see this airports from your private jets? Then jumping in your helicopter?
I just wish one of the questions could be "Donald, what the fuck are you talking about?" #debatenight
It’s really all about Trump’s properties &amp; what’s good for him, not us #Debates2016 #debatenight #PresidentialDebate
#debatenight when Trump speaks I hear passion. When Hilary speaks I hear a robot.
#Trump just admitted he takes advantage of laws to screw over people who work for him. What the hell are you thinking, #USA?! #Debates2016
Watching this #debate is giving me High Blood Pressure. I can't imagine how Hillary is dealing. #debatenight #Debates2016
I would laugh at this clown if he weren't chasing me in this nightmare that seemingly won't end. #debatenight
So much for my hopes that the debates would actually be moderated...sigh #Debates2016
Donald trump is like a living gif the way he keeps making goofy faces and sighing. #debatenight #debates #Debates2016
I'm scared for our #country! Both #candidates suck and I'm pretty sure the #StockMarketCrash will happen within the next week. #Debates2016
No, Trump we don't need to "brink back" Law &amp; Order! SVU already airs every Wednesday on NBC. #Debates2016 #debates
#Debates convinced Trump is related to Mr. Crocker off of fairly odd parents 😂😂
Is this entire campaign just an add for Trump's DC hotel? #debatenight
Trump is all BARK and NO BITE. Don't confuse NOISE with FACTS. #imwithher #trumpeduptrickledown #trumplivesinhisownreality #debates
It baffles me that people actually would trust Trump after these #Debates when the rest of the world wouldnt trust him with scissors
Hillary Clinton keeps saying "fact checker" and all I can hear is "fat checker" Annunciate, woman.  #debatenight
#Hillary knows #Trump is right, has a look on her face, how will I deal with these problems, now she is saying thing are great #debatenight
#Hillary looks exhausted.  Go home Mrs. Clinton. You're tired. #NeverHillary #debatenight  #debates  #Debates2016
You where there when #ISIS was an infant and your going to stop it now? I don't think so HILLARY! #debatenight #debate
Donald debating Is basically the living example of the poop emoji #Debates
Lester: "We're talking about racial healing.. what does this birther stuff have to do with that" Trump: sniffle. #Debates2016
Trump doesn't own property in a cyber community. Or Does he? Prepare to find out! #Debates2016
literally a presidential candidate just called chicago a "war torn country" WUT #debatenight
I've prepared to be President. And that's a good thing. OH I LOVE YOU @HillaryClinton #Debates2016
China. Business. Million. Trillion. China. Business. Million. Trillion. Beyoncé lyrics or Trump rhetoric? #debatenight
Why isn't @GovGaryJohnson not on stage, imagine facts being presented curtesy of true exec experience #TeamGov #LetGaryDebate #debates
I hope everyone does what I just did and change to channel #Debates2016 #LetGaryDebate those two are embarrassing #MomDadFight
Can you all please speak about Hempstead, NY? I feel like a forgotten life. #Debates2016
Trump wants to phone a friend. That's not how this works, buddy. #debatenight
Trump said you learn a lot from financial disclosure and not tax returns 🤔 Bye Trump 😂  #DebateNight
Hillary just held herself back like my mom used to right before she was about to slap me. #debatenight
OMG Trump just stop talking. You are all over the place. Better temperament? Seriously? #debatenight #voteforHillary
@TheRock #debates so far Hilary Is handling herself much better than Trump - he interrupts her quite a bit which is a bad no no
Trump's 10 year-old son has computerS.  I think I had a Game Boy SP at that age.  #Debates2016
On the one night I need a bottle of wine and I have NONE. #debatenight  #needwine
I just keep flinching every minute I watch this.  I'm not sure what to expect next lol !!! #Debates2016 #Debates2016
Trump just directly called LESTER HOLT wrong what is wrong with him #debatenight
hey Hillary guess what?? GUNS DONT KILL PEOPLE. it's the person pulling the trigger 🙃 #debates2016
HRC should pause, and turn to Donald. "Are you finished. Do you want some Spaghetti O's?" Pull the mom card and SHUT IT DOWN!! #debatenight
This a high school debate: popular douche shows up unprepared, nerdy know it all comes ready but nobody likes either one #debatenight
Unprovoked attack of another military force wouldn't start a war says Trump. #debatenight
Gosh Trump you have an amplifier in your chest? You're so loud!!! #debatenight
"I have a much better temperament" - @realDonaldTrump can't not lie can he? #debatenight
LOOOOOL someone get Trump out of here please. Presidential debate and he's talking about his temperament #Debates2016
"I prepared to be President and I think that's a good thing." - Clinton #debatenight
Tax return vs emails come on Trump release your tax return #debatenight
No one is going to call out Trump for sending jobs to China??? #debatenight
Trump says he's gonna bring jobs back... had golf courses across the globe. #debates
Donald trump talking about his taxes coming out is like me saying I'm gonna pay my car note on time. Sorry @Chase. #debates
HOW CAN YOU REFUTE A FUCKING FACT?!?! STOP AND FRISK IS UNCONSTITUTIONAL!!! #debates
*takes a break to make a bowl of mac and cheese* #debatenight
@realDonaldTrump Will release his tax returns against his laywers' advice, if #CrookedHillary released her 30K DELETED EMAILS!  #debates2016
Let's not forget how he stiffed the people in Scotland. So much for foreign policy. #Debates
Wtf is he talking about with all this airport talk and then he segued from how much money he has!? #debatenight #PresidentialDebate
Trump: "I'm great!" Lester: "But how will that fix the problem?" Trump: "Doesn't matter, because I'm so great!" #debatenight
#debatenight Those things are true because of YOUR husband!!! Which YOU supported!!!!
You've gone bankrupt several times and routinely refuse to pay people what you owe them. You know about money though. Right. #debatenight
I am quite amazed that Trump just made the argument that he takes advantage of laws to cheat people to make money. #Debates2016
It's crazy how Trump calls out Hillary on her "race relations" status and he's actually right. And she knows it. #debatenight
It's difficult for Trump to speak coherently with a personality disorder and coke drip. #DebateNight #TrumpSniff
@realDonaldTrump &amp; @HillaryClinton are hiding too much, but don't know how to. doesn't work that way.  #Debates2016
Hahahahaha! Fly lists? And back to stop and frisk? You are an idiot #Debates2016

I bet you won't hear Trump complaining about being up against MNF tomorrow. #debates
I applaud @realDonaldTrump for bringing up the 400 pound hacker in the room #NYDebate #debatenight #ImWithHer
Why do they say "restore trust with police and communities?" When was there ever trust? #Debates2016
Trump talking about cyberattacks sounds like someone who doesn't use a computer to do anything other than Tweet #Debates2016 #fb
A man who can be provoked with a Tweet should not have his finger on the nuclear codes.  #Debates2016 #fb
"I happen to think it's double that." - What you happen to think is really ridiculous. #debatenight #Debates2016
"If I don't get there, I'm going to get to Pennsylvania Avenue one way or another." Yeah, no shit, you can take a trip to DC. #debatenight

Who the hell is Sean Hannity and why does he want me to call him????? #debatenight
#debates There's no such thing as "trickle down." Never was. It was made up by a critic of Reaganomics.
#debatenight Mr. Poutylips Trump looks like he is ready to grab his marbles and go home. stop the sniffling. Must be his poor health.
DID HE FUCKING SIGH WHEN SHE SAID BLACK COMMUNITIES ARE VIBRANT??  #debatenight #whitesagainsttrump
Hillary laughing everything off is going to turn a lot of people off #Debates2016 @chucktodd
Welp, this debate is probably gonna run over unless @LesterHoltNBC throws a hail mary. You can do it!  #Debates2016
Is it just me or is this debate getting more and more ridiculous? Maybe it's because of my mug of not tea, but I doubt it #Debates2016
"I want to strangle Trump like Leia did to Jabba the Hut. I bet it would feel the same, too" - Housemate S #Debates2016
Kinda miss watching the debates 4 years ago in senior government where @kelseyrandolph_ and I stuck together with our unpopular opinions😅🇺🇸
Lmao Trump said when HC releases her emails, he'll release his audits. #debatenight
No matter how much #Trump rambles on, #Hillary is driving this #debatenight and he follows
Trump's profound solutions to gun crime &amp; police shootings:  "We need law &amp; order" "Stop and frisk" "These are bad people" #debatenight
I can't take either of these people seriously on matters of business #debatenight
#debatenight  @madmaxDonaldTrump His TEMPERAMENT is NOT fit for POTUS.  Period.  Full stop.
Oh you got Obama to produce his birth certificate? K got it. Who knew? #debatenight
Trump is blathering!!!! People are REALLY thinking about voting for nutjob???? #debatenight #VoteOutGOP #VoteBlue
Please. Please! Please, Hillary! Call him out or use the word "bigly!" #debatenight
Trump says Clinton doesn't want to use the words "law and order". I don't remember "order", but "law" she did. #debatenight
I wonder if Joe the Plumber was one of Trump's unpaid contractors #debatenight
A private email server is disgraceful but not paying your federal taxes isn’t??? #debatenight
#debates omg can anyone possibly vote for this Trump buffoon seriously? He doesn't answer the question - bait and switch is his forte
Bringing up "superpredators" a bold move from a man who called for the EXECUTIONS of the innocent Central Park 5. #DebateNight
Look how calm H is - you just know D is sweating like a pig under his ill-fitting suit! 🐷 #debates
He's backpedalling so fast!!! Is he even still in the building?!?!?! #debates
Trump say US look like a third world country ...he doesn't even know what a third world country look like #debatenight
what he doesn't understand is... it is not about him or his company... it is about an entire nation and its people.  #debates2016
HARAMBE DEAD, GANGS OF ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS IN THE STREETS, WHAT NEXT HILLARY?!?!?!? #debates2016
when you don't like either candidates but you have to vote for one of them, even though they're both full of crap. #debates
Why are his tax returns any more viable than the 33K deleted emails? #debatenight
@HillaryClinton Finally having the opportunity to listen to Sec Clinton-- the more she speaks, the more I like her #debatenight
"What do you say to the American people?"  "I say nothing."  top kek #debatenight
"A man who is provoked by a tweet should not have his fingers anywhere close to a nuclear weapon button." -- @HillaryClinton #Debates2016
Trump calling for a reboot of Law &amp; Order.  I miss that show, too.  #debatenight
STOP &amp; FRISK IS UNCONSTITUTIONAL. Honor their rights so they honor your rights. #Debates
It's fair to declare that who lost the debate was the American people. #debatenight
REPORT: Something terrible is happening to Lester Holt and no one knows what it is #debatenight
Saying someone's name over and over is an old trick to gain favor. Don't fall 4 it #debatenight @LesterHoltNBC
"We have to get guns out of the hands of people who should not have them" @HillaryClinton #debatenight #ImWithHer
You're telling me if we cut taxes on the wealthy that they're going to invest &amp; share w/us poor folk &amp; not line their pockets? #debatenight
Does anyone else think it's weird that Donald has on a blue tie and Hillary has on a red dress? Democratic blue and republican red🤔 #Debates
50 bucks to the first person in the room who yells "BABA BOOEY" #Debates2016
What's the deal with the club? He just reverted around the questions. #Debates2016
how DARE you talk about business in palm beach and ignore the painful racial schisms across the country #debatenight
Everyone should be respected by the law, and everyone should respect the law. Poised response from @HillaryClinton #debates
How do you propose we create Law and Order, Mr. Trump?  Martial law?  #debates
So far we know Trump doesn't pay taxes or pay contractors #debatenight
Steven Hill has passed, ok? Law and Order is not returning. #debates
HRC cited Michelle Obama's speech instead of plagiarizing him like Melania 😂😂 #debates
Lester asking about Russian hackings knowing very damn well that Trump and Putin are bffs 😂😂 #debates
Trump calls for Hillary's emails to be released but they were... and cleared by the FBI... Where are your taxes #Debates2016
Trump then goes onto to say Stop and Frisk isn't racial profiling while explaining how it's racial profiling. #DebateNight
@realDonaldTrump is losing this debate by blabbing instead of sticking it the topic #debatenight
Trump was 100% for the war in Iraq. End of discussion. Jesus Christ you goddam idiots. THIS IS NOT A DEBATABLE POINT. #debatenight
"Here's a fact"                                                      "No you're wrong"                                       #debatenight
This is the first debate where I actually don't understand what the Republican candidate is saying &amp; I have a master's degree. #debatenight
To paraphrase the brilliant @LilTunechi, Donald Trump is so beneath her cleats. #debatenight
Hillary sells books, Trump sells his businesses. He will make laws to help his businesses. There is no doubt. #debates
People get shot @realDonaldTrump because of our shitty gun laws. When you can buy guns with no background check. #debates
Im so upset that @BernieSanders withdrew from the presidential race right now. #debatenight #debates #Debates2016 #weareallscrewed
#Debates Does this man ever read a newspaper?  Or ASK questions or seek information?
Trump: very very jobs many many investments so so many shut up Hillary Obama bad china bad Mexico bad  #debatenight
"I'm relieved that my late father never did business with you." -@HillaryClinton is my hero #debatenight #ImWithHer
#Debates  What about the banks that failed, and Obama, and Clinton bailed them out?
Trump is suffering from a sinus problem not exposed in his doctor's letter. Noticeable since June 2015. #debates2016 #StrongerTogether
"@JamesUrbaniak: He's sniffing more than Bowie on Cavett in '74." Trump must have sinus trouble his doctor not reporting about. #debates2016
Now he's piggybacking on her eloquence. He's not a leader.  #debates
Hillary taxation is theft Paying taxes is not patriotic and will never be so #Debates
Dammit Hillary you were doing so well. And now you just assume all Muslims can bring forth information on terrorists. Great job #debatenight
This whore is talking about the law and police meanwhile how many people did the Clinton Foundation kill in the last year? #Debates
Sorry I don't believe either of them. Both are liars #JustSaying sorry just wanted to put that here #Debates
I feel like this election is the longest episode of Punk'd ever! #debatenight
Pretty sure I see a coughing fit coming up in the next few minutes...#debatenight #debates #Killary #MAGA
Hillary is running out of answers.  Hopes the fact checkers can cover for here.  #debatenight
Hillary is running out of answers.  Hopes the fact checkers can cover for her.  #debatenight
Shut her up.  Shut her up.  Shut her up.  Or lock her up!  Muslims want to kill us.  When have they helped?  #debatenight
Oh great trump thinks I weigh 400lbs.  Programmers are people too 😭 #debates #debatenight
"He's hiding his tax returns!" Says the person hiding 30K emails and health records.  #Debates
She called him a racist! I didn't think she would be so direct. Go Hillary! #debates
Birth certificate? Hah, he got owned! Les is doing great.  #debatenight
@realDonaldTrump, buddy, hit @HillaryClinton on war. She supports all of them. Wars not popular. Own the anti war platform. #debatenight
I think #debatenight is essentially another "Roast" special on Comedy Central. These two morons are walking contradictions.
I have two papers due and a exam tomorrow, but now I'm stuck watching the Hilary slay Trump. #debatenight
Raging heroin epidemic, streets on fire in major cities and the debate has to talk about birtherism. Clear win for HRC. #debatenight
"Get rid of things that look good but didn't work." Do you mean, like, gun control and gun free zones? #DebateNight
"This is the greatest mess i have ever seen" i don't know trump, my mom used to say that about my room when I was 16 #debatenight
Well this debate is going exactly as i figured it would #debatenight
"Take advantage of the laws of the nation." -Donald Trump. Taking advantage of our country and our working class? Real impressive.  #Debates
Bicker, bicker, bicker... I've seen schoolyard arguments more civilized than these two. #Debates
#debatenight #USElections2016 Hillary has a hard time to not to laugh and Donald trying too hard to be serious...absolutely hilarious 😂
Listening to Clinton and Trump argue over who the biggest corporate shill is. Sad. #debatenight
What are some opportunities to organize in these elections to organize? Can blacks and Latinos come together to fight this beast? #debates
"you shouldn't have a profit motivation to fill prison cells with young americans"   PREACH GIRL    #DebateNight
Trump shut up please oloshi 😂😂😂  he no sabi keep secret 😂😂😂 #Debates2016
The fact that Hillary is keeping her composure with Trump's constant screaming is so impressive. #debatenight
Uh, I hope the fact checkers are looking at you now Hillary.  Obama &amp; you didn't do anything 4 the Status of Forces Agreement. #debatenight
#Hillary, please stop smiling and laughing so much. I know you're trying to be cool and whatevs but it comes off smug and annoying #debates
These debates were a lot more enjoyable when Trump was stuffing Jeb Bush in a locker every 10 seconds.
Good to hear both candidates backing gun bans for people on terrorist watchlists and no-fly zones. Common sense. #debatenight
Trump's comments now make sense. We in the UK and Europe cannot freeload off America's military, we must contribute our fair share.#debates
"Charlotte, a city I love, a city I have investments in...". Riiiiight. #priorities #debatenight
So far this debate, both candidates have not agreed on one thing #debates
Trump says we need to catch the bad guys to stop violence. Why didn't anyone think of this before???? #debatenight
Extra yelly tonight. Hit up Millvale if you feel like getting punched. #debatenight
Didn't #DumbDonald accuse the innocent Central Park 5 of Super Predatory behavior, in full-page ads? #debatenight #Debates2016 #debate
I tough @HillaryClinton was recovering from a healthy issue, now she confessed she was preparing #DebateNight. Another LIE!
#Clinton says "we have to tackle the plague of gun violence" #Trump says "we need law and order and we don't have it" #debatenight
2 min answer is going to be at least 20 mins long I bet #Debates
I think America's black community doesn't only live in the inner cities. #debatenight
Audience chuckles at "I have a much better temperament than she does." #debates
You used certain laws in place....so you took advantage of tax loopholes, corruption, etc. Alright Donald #debatenight
Omg the reason I'm watching #debatenight is exactly for reasons like that. "We all have implicit biases."
If you can't pronounce "Muslims" or the "Quran" correctly, you shouldn't be president. #DebateNight
Let's see him lie out of his birther crusade that was the genesis of this present day farce. #debatenight
"You were the one who brought up super-predator about young black youth," Trump accuses Clinton during #debatenight.
#Debates2016 DEM politics suppresses &amp; oppresses further the poor thru pacification.welfare=free money to shut them up.but keeps them down
#debates Hillary-  YOU ARE THE CAUSE OF ISIS AND THE COMPLETE DESTABILIZATION OF THE MIDDLE EAST! #factcheckthat
Trump is excellent at rambling on about issues but never actually addressing what he will do to make changes. Lol #debatenight
Say what you want about #Debates2016 but I REALLY wish @RozRBentley's mom was on @twitter.
@reaIDonaldTrunp "knows about money" but thinks his dad's loan was very small? #debatenight #debate
Trump acts as if stopping ISIS will eliminate all current and future terrorism. #Debates2016
Just wanted to remind everyone that this #debatenight is for President of the United States.  President, everyone.  Okay, thanks.
They should pay what they agreed to. But I’m smart enough to avoid paying taxes #PresidentialDebate #DebateNight
Y am I even watching this???🙄 they keep interrupting each other like calm down. #Debates2016
Hillary calls for Terrorist List to be used to remove #2A rights without any opportunity for citizens to defend themselves. #DebateNight
The way she fake laughs makes me want to vomit.  #Debates
Mediator Man has a killer suit on - looking sharpe fella! #DebateNight
you're currently listening to two hypocrites who are feeding you lies to get your vote lol #debatenight
Trump without applause is like a sitcom w/o a laugh track. #debatenight
"If you land at LAX it looks like a third-world country."  And he just proved he's never been to a third world country. #debates
All of our kids and grandkids are doomed. That's all I have to say. #Debates2016
@RjHaddyofficial what is the drink of choice for the debates? Whiskey sour? Martini? PGA?
"DON'T WANT TO ENGAGE OTHER COUNTRIES IN A DIFFERENT KIND OF WARFARE... BUT IF THEY WANT IT––TELL THEM TO PULL UP" -Hillary #debatenight
@chancetherapper the truth is hidden under the rug brother. The debates are a sales pitch. He said she said. Why only two parties?!
Trust me, and my doctor, and my kids, and David Duke!  #debatenight
The “cyber” thing is very important, probably just as much as these “interwebs” #debates
You think they are going to go through the system to by a gun Hillary? Oh. Okay. #debatenight
I'm pretty sure @realDonaldTrump just said he wants to take your guns away!!  #debatenight
#debatenight #Debates2016   This is shaping up to be the longest 90 minutes of my life.
What took you so long to see he was black 😂 #Debates2016
Oh good Lord, China should invade North Korea.  Hold me people, hold me. #debatenight
Im so ashamed to share the tittle of human being with #Drumpf  #Debates
Idk why, I just think I'd like @realDonaldTrump more if he smiled more... #debatenight #Debates2016 #SmileMore #feminist #smilehoney
in all fairness the @realDonaldTrump  can't meet the people stiffed by you because they're dead @HillaryClinton  #Debates
This is non-linear logic. I'm not understanding the connections between the birther debate and combating ISIS #Debates2016
The #debatenight is on and people at work keep asking me about down pipes and toilets... priorities people!
I'm at dinner so I can't really watch the debate. Thank you twitter for keeping me &amp; @idkISAAC in the know 🙏🏼 #debatenight #ImWithHer
I'm doing pretty fine as an African American. 🙋 Anyone else? #Debates2016
Clinton accusing Trump of not being charitable. LOL. All of her charity giving goes to her!   #debatenight
If there is anything that we learn from tonight it is that we all need to VOTE! #Debates2016
Let's see a list of names of these "generals and admirals" please.  #Debates2016
Hillary Clinton is saying she's tough on espionage. She ran an illegal, unsecured email server filled with state secrets. #debates
Clinton's blather may delight some Dems, but #INDEPENDENTS &amp; common sense Dems shud be able to see thru her. #debatenight
Hillary - stop and frisk "does not work" - and now, when pressed by Trump "it has worked" OOOK #debatenight
With the america gun debate, taking the guns away won't stop the crimes. Guns are illegal in England, gun crimes still happen. #debatenight
#debatenight Fact Check: Trump is also in favor of "Stop and Sniff".
Sheesh! I'd rather be a San Jose Sharks fan than vote for Trump! #Debates2016 #GKG
Did trump just accidentally say we should have better gun control? #debatenight
@realDonaldTrump- stop falling for her purposeful distractions - don't waste time- just put out there the realities- period! #debatenight
All in all, aside from TPP and Trade, Trump has been both on the attack and the defense, and HRC has been sailing smoothly. #debatenight
OK, uh, Hillary, not a good thing to suggest the entire country is racist. I mean, I am, against Belgians, but everyone? Cmon. #debates
Meanwhile, 100 million Americans are like "who the fuck is Debbie Wasserman Schultz?" #debates
Your Mom is a mainstream media nonsense and various of scientists say so. #debates
#Debates2016 Lester Holt is letting Trump speak OVER Hillary's time. He must moderate.
"If you're too dangerous to fly, you're too dangerous to buy a gun" Hillary REASONABLE Clinton #DebateNight
#debates we the gloves off they throwing everything out there i see some presidential debates over but this is wild and nuts come on you all
Can you imagine Trump closing the divide in this nation??? Hell to the no no no. He furthers the distance. 👿 #debatenight #Debates2016
Just remember if anything bad is happening, law and order is all you need to know #debates
Okay!!RT @GypsyKya: But Donald! You said blacks are lazy. NOW you care? #debatenight
Donald wants China to start a war with North Korea. Wtf? #debatenight
Holy fuck I'd rather shove push pins in between my fingernails than listen to these debates
#Debates2016 Clinton is putting the hammer on the Donald about his business
Divide is worse now than when @potus took office. Leading by narrative made it worse. #neverhillary will continue that problem. #debatenight
Trump's "law and order" policy: No guns for bad people. No really, that's what he's got. #debatenight #gunsense
@EnemyWithinn They got you on tape, "I guess I'm for the war", but what's this #WINNINGtemperamentLOL ??? @RealDonaldTrump #DebateNight
HOW DO YOU HEAL THE RACIAL DIVIDE? all I hear is guns, criminals, law &amp; order...ALL PEOPLE OF COLOR ARE NOT CRIMINALS! #debatenight
why is hillary talking about national security make america great again # debatenight
honestly tho jfk bathrooms are dirty and dubai bathrooms are so nice i like eat off the floor... #debatenight
Clinton might have a more composed temperament, but that's not gonna make her the better president. #Debates
Clinton's tone/content now openly sanctimonious in this exchange. Now says she's glad her late dad didn't do biz with Trump. #debatenight
Please move on.  Just...don't let him speak anymore.  HE KEEPS CUTTING THE OTHER GUY OFF! SHUT UP!  #debatenight
Hillary literally just talks about fucking middle class and hasn't said anything else besides her book and how its our so.... #debatenight
#DonaldTrump is being flat out rude to #LesterHolt #debatenight We can't have such a person represent us as #POTUS #POTUS2016
Chicago was a problem before Obama and it'll be a problem after! #Debates
Trump"Shout out to my peeps at the NRA" really? I mean really #debatenight
So how many times is Trump going to defend a policy that was ruled unconstitutional? #debatenight
Tax returns &amp; @realDonaldTrump "As soon as she releases her emails i'll release my taxes" #TrumpVsHillary #taxreturns #debatenight
#Debates Russia has always played the long game, make friends then conquer
Could ABC not afford a little bell for when time is expired? #debates
Thinking about drinking wine, every time he drinks water.  Ha #debatenight #Debates2016
If he paid taxes it would have been squandered. So you didn't pay? #debates2016
It's 10:11pm no mention of securing our border or the WALL. #debatenight
Sadly, @realDonaldTrump lost tonight for 2 reasons: 1. U can't let liberals define the the argument.  2. The glass of water.  #debatenight
we have to look very strongly. Look Very Strongly. LOOK VERY STRONGLY. #debates #debatenight
Trump would rather list his endorsements than actual explain how he will be a good president #debates #DonaldTrump #Debates2016
If he don't shut the hell up tlaking about he just left Detroit. I ain't see you in the hood bro #debatenight
So impressed with @HillaryClinton for staying calm, I would have slapped this man already #debatenight #gbless #theleaderweneed
Clinton says Trump alienated Muslims, Trump says Clinton's admin created the mess in middle east.NATO should focus on terror #debatenight
I don't think I've ever seen a Presidential candidate not claiming to cater to the middle class #debates
What?!? U can release the tax return during an audit as lester stated...now theres strings attached? Doesnt bode well trump. #Debates2016
Trump may as well just call @LesterHoltNBC 'BOY' w his rude condescending disrespectful ass! Children have better manners! #debatenight
*Trump advisers, whispering into his earpiece*   "Just keep naming countries. That's presidential. You're killing it." #debatenight
I'm not convinced that either of these people survive on blood or oxygen. #PresidentialDebate #Debates2016
Can we get a @BuzzFeed article containing all the tweets @realDonaldTrump deleted tonight?? Please? #debatenight
@DrJillStein Occupy the Debates ...@Dr.Jill Stein  2016 only adult in this race people .
Donald Trump cant even answer a race question correctly without changing the subject #debatenight
#debatenight Trump keeps talking about how much he is endorsed ... 😨😵😳😟😒😒😒
If you can't learn that much from a tax return, then why not release them? #debatenight
I'm really enjoying the split screen as Trump twitches and smirks as HRC discussed his tax returns. #debatenight
This #debatenight is literally like watching a Monty Python sketch making fun of Americans.
"The record shows that I'm right." OH OK, WHEN YOU PUT IT THAT WAY. #debatenight
Trump thinks we should, "take the oil" like you just dig it up  and move it around. Or, and more so, like it was ours to take #Debates2016
@Entrepreneurs4H @realDonaldTrump Who said he's being truthful? He's doing his best to keep up his lying ways #Debates2016 #NeverTrump
"You are wrong. I did come prepared. And I also came prepared to be president." --@HillaryClinton #BAMF #debatenight
.@realDonaldTrump will work for America with a proven track record of tax evasion  #debatenight
You know what else I prepared for?  I prepared to be president!  #I'm with her #debatenight
Trump is just telling what's coming, stop and frisk will be routine in this country,  Muslim terrorists are already among us.  #debatenight
Obama was wearing traditional African clothing! Stop beating that dead horse #debatenight
"By the end of the night I think I'll be  blamed for everything that's ever happened." - HC "Why not." -  DT.  -  What?!?  #Debates2016
We shouldn't have a profit motive to put people in prison. Yes, HC! #Debates2016
Okay how bad is the sniffing? I feel like when he sniffs I am watching Pinocchio's nose grow. #NeverTrump #ImWithHer #debatenight
“Go my book at the airport…Go look at my website.” How about steaks? Got your own steaks? #Debate2016 #DebateNight
OH: This debate is like watching two psych patients debate before medication. #debates #Debates2016
Trump would be that kid that always brings up that one time you skinned your knee on the court. #Debates2016
No one can see that you have good relations with African Americans Trump #debatenight
Trump's acting like that kid that had to talk in front of class for 5 minutes and tried to BS the whole speech. #debatenight
The plans should have started when your husband was president!  #debatenight
My mom just referred to Trump as "Don" and idk why I find that so funny but 😂😂 #debatenight
#debatenight I was just telling myself man we have some shitty ass airports here in America
She should look and act pissed that she's even sharing a stage with this clown. #Debates
Is it me @HillaryClinton answer the questions and @realDonaldTrump just bullshits his way around it #Debates2016 #factcheck2016
Trump bragging that he was "smart" using tax loopholes to pay no tax some years. Talk about playing by different rules. #debatenight
I do think that the drone warfare is too slow in taking out ISIS and sometimes not reliable causing collateral damage. #DebateNight
@HillaryClinton oh, so you're not going to mention the emails at all, eh? #debatenight #Debates2016
Trump likens U.S airports to those of a third world country #Debates2016 #debatenight
@realDonaldTrump took advantage of the poor and made himself rich and he agrees #debatenight
I just want her to say, “What the hell are you talking about?!” #debates #soconfused
If you're voting or even supporting Trump! I'm praying for you!! Cause you're clearly aren't thinking straight!! #debatenight
If your going to speak on a sensitive topic, don't ruin your own credibility. #debatenight
He literally said he has a better temperament than Clinton. He's clearly not watching this debate. 😂😂 #debatenight
"They talk good around election time." Trump, on the other hand, doesn't talk so "good." #Debates2016
Clinton's rope-a-dope is working. He's so into it now, the sniffles are almost non existent. #debatenight
Yea, let's bring up the race card.. cause you know about all of that so well right Trump #debatenight
@LesterHoltNBC changes the subject to security challenges...@HillaryClinton comments on Russian cyber attacks, Putin #Debates2016
trump on "Cyber": "We need to build a wall. An internet wall to keep out the Ruskies." #debatenight
If Trump and Hillary don't need to cite sources than I don't either! #mmc3602 #debatenight
At least he is saying "please." Trump remembered his manners tonight. #Govyo @NazAPGovEcon #debatenight
More police Stop and frisk  Yea that will help community relations   #debatenight
GROSS. HOW DARE YOU. Our President has always been an American you TWIT. #debates
If you're gonna go there, you're opening up all the things you've said about your Republican opponents.  Fair game. #debates
YOU KNOW WHAT ELSE IS THE LEADING CAUSE OF DEATH OF AFRICAN AMERICAN MEN? 85 IQ #debates
I didn't think I could get this pissed off less than 30min into a debate. Holy shit. This has to be a prank.... right? #debatenight
W    r     o     n    g #debatenight #Debates2016 #debates
"I also have a much better temperament than she does." Donald Trump is yelling. Why is he yelling? Please make him stop. #debatenight
Trump's about to smack down this birther criticism once and for all. #debatenight
We've gotta get guns out of the hands of people who should not have them. #debatenight
Claim that @realDonaldTrump is paying 0 in taxes is ridiculous.  He has certainly paid tax! #debatenight
Institute stop and frisk when police relations are so sensitive? does he know what unconstitutional means🤔  @KevinWagnerPhD #debatenight
I'm confused, Don has talked more about China tonight than the US. Also, does he think that Ford Motor Co is running for president? #debates
Trump targeting Obama and Clinton: "President Obama and Hillary created a vacuum that created ISIS." #JMC3413 #LiveTweeting #debates

What a sideshow this #Debates2016 is, very low energy and no substance. #LetGaryDebate
#debatenight I settled that suit with no admission of guilt. And that's a good thing?
#debatenight answer the questions and we'll hear what you have to say.
"Maybe he's not as rich as he says he is."   You know that hurt him. #debatenight

Laughed so hard about Trump's "best asset" I sent myself into a coughing fit &amp; honestly sums up my feelings about the election #debatenight
I can't listen to Hillary's voice. It's worse than listening to alley cats in heat dragging their claws down a chalkboard. #debatenight
Clinton saying we *all* have implicit biases, but it's vital to do police retraining because for cops it's life or death. #debatenight
when Trump is screaming about heaven knows what and Hil is just standing there smirking cool as a cucumber my guuuuurl #debatenight
She's still smiling and looking presidential. Oh please, now Sean Hannity's been mentioned. #debatenight #Sniff
Just bc you settle a lawsuit with "no admission of guilt" doesn't mean you're not guilty.... #Debates2016
"Your president" Last i checked he was the president of everyone in the US you asshole. Dont try to undermine President Obama #Debates2016
#Trump extremely weak on the birth certificate thing. Looks wobbled in rnd 9. Still just ahead on points but for how long? #debatenight
.RT @BettyFckinWhite: If you stay in a Trump hotel, refuse to pay. Say that you weren't satisfied. He said that's cool. #debatenight
Temperament?? Really??!! Sick person wants to lead USA. He lost contact w reality. Go a way Trump #debates  #debatenight

Who's performing at #Halftime? There's no way we have to sit through 90 straight minutes of this clown show commercial-free. #debatenight
this is like when i audition against someone without a bfa #Debates2016
I get the feeling that #trump is living in a little #idealbusinessworld of his own, making money by working within the law #debatenight
Havnt wachd no CAMPAIGN, YO peeps are blind! As soon do, Y is Hillary wearing RED N Donald wearing BLUE..... IN FRNT OUR EYES!  #debatenight
How is Trump's son the same age as his wife??? 😳🙃😇  #robinvale #debatenight  #Debates2016 #F208Debate #B306
Hillary is telling Trump off like a parent telling off a teacher for saying that their child isn't smart enough #debatenight  #debates
Y do U feel U have better judgement than Clinton? "I have better judgement than her. there's no doubt about that" #notananswer #debatenight
Has @realDonaldTrump even seen an airport in a 3rd World Country? ARE YOU KIDDING ME? #debatenight
&gt; "I CARE ABOUT PEOPLE IN A CITY BECAUSE I HAVE PROPERTY THERE"   #ShitTrumpSays #debatenight
&gt; "WE HAVE SO MANY THINGS WE SHOULD BE DOING BETTER THAN THEM AND CYBER IS ONE OF THEM"  MAKE AMERICA GREAT AT CYBERING AGAIN   #debatenight
Don't know why some of y'all feeling some type of way about these #Debates2016.... y'all still waiting on the sitting President's promises 🤔
This looks more like satire of a debate rather than an actual debate... #DebateNight
Guys, Trump is sniffling. Is he not well? Is he seriously ill? Is he....LOW ENERGY? Does he have the stamina to be president? #debatenight
How many minutes are in a little while @realDonaldTrump  #NeverTrump  #Debates2016  #Hillary2016  #fyilive
This man couldn't manage a Olive Garden let alone our country and economy.  #NeverTrump  #Debates2016  #Hillary2016  #fyilive
Let's get debt-free college - @HillaryClinton Have you heard of Trump University? No? Great! - @realDonaldTrump  #Debates2016
Most of the gangs are not illegal immigrants. I'd like to know when Trump ever met a gang member. #debatenight
Hillary has prepared for the #debates and to become President. @realDonaldTrump  just polished his lies.
Trump loves throwing numbers &amp; countries around. He is like a teen magazine, has a lot of buzz words, but not alot of content #debatenight
You can literally see Hillary bracing herself for all of the racism. #debatenight
Mrs. Clinton!? She is former senator or former Secretary of State Clinton! #debatenight
This is the most intense episode of House of Cards yet. #debatenight
But why can't Trump release his tax returns from prior years?  #debatenight
I am not understanding his "best words" they just aren't coherent. And still more stiffing. 😳 #debatenight
"against my lawyer's advice"...Why would voters actually need T's tax information before election day? #debatenight
His nasty, cheap behavior with the people he stiffs is really essential -- it shows his character. #debatenight
D: Iraq pull out sucked H: pull out was Bush D: Hilary's pull out of Iraq sucked H: *her face: this shit again* #debatenight
Donald: as far as the nuclear is concerned...  Um, what? #debatenight
Ugh, yes we are updating our nuclear systems and we haven't used B-52s to deliver them for decades! #debatenight
This debate is more fun to watch than high school teenage drama. #Debates2016
@NoahCRothman In other news the sun was observed rising in the east this morning. #debatenight
#Debates2016 #debatenight Ok, guys, lets move on and talk about some new issues!!
#debatenight #Debates2016 Trump - my strongest asset is my temperament. His joking, surely.
Lord help the people who have to defend Trumps actions tonight. Speaking over everyone is just childish😒 #debatenight
That's his first two "Believe Mes of the night.  LIke the conspiranoia regarding the Fed. #debates #Debates2016
Trump cares about Hispanics as long as they stay behind the wall #debatenight
It's called being an adult @realDonaldTrump and putting aside your difference for the greater good. Ass hat! #debatenight
#Debates if She thinks Obama was great she could just continue with the same political ideals she's fake!
We should get guns out of the hands of people who should not hand them: #Clinton #Debates2016 #debatenight
"I prepared for this debate and I prepared to be President." @HillaryClinton #debatenight
#debatenight "I have a much better temperament than her." Um... Have you listened to this debate?
Someone get @LesterHoltNBC a #mutebutton a la @AroundtheHorn. Seems to work for @TonyReali when he needs people to stop talking. #debates
#DebateNight birther issue, what about her email, Benghazi, money lost at state department
@realDonaldTrump what does "law and order"even mean to you? Way to skirt around that question #debatenight
feel physically ill at the imminent prospect of Tr*mp discussing race #debatenight
Lol Hillary looks bored. That's what happens when you debate with a narcissistic hairpiece. #debatenight
Both kiddo 1 &amp;!2 are watching the debate for homework. I can only imagine what they are going to try and write down.... #debatenight
All the way I looking for Hillary Clinton success in the election for American #debatenight
#Debates both full of malarkey. not worth watching anymore of this my mind id made up.
Trump is the only one on the stage wearing an American flag pin. Did you just notice that? #Debates #Debates2016
Donald Trump's relationship to Chicago: "I know, I have property there." There's SO much in that statement, I can't. #Debates2016
@realDonaldTrump screaming like a nutjob doesnt make you right or what you say true #debatenight #NeverTrump #ImWithHer
#debatenight How's the shit show been on Twitter? My phone was charging so I forgot to Tweet. I don't know if that was good or bad.
@ThePatriot143 I think he sucks. All of the topics are about Trump, none of them are about Crooked Hillary! #debatenight
he really sounded like joanne prada just then i was waiting for him to say "honestly, truly" #debatenight
#debatenight where is Lester Holt. He is letting her say everything she wants to
Oh for heaven sake, the emails have been seen. Release your taxes @realDonaldTrump. Only losers hide information. #debates
@LesterHoltNBC ... E.T. Phone home.... can you take control of the debate??? #debates
I think Donald Trump is stuck in his own personal Mandela effect #debatenight
#debates @realDonaldTrump @HillaryClinton He sounds like a 4th grader, OH YEAH??? well you're a doody head
Trump reminds me of someone drunk trying to argue. They make no sense, but they've gone too far so they have to keep on yelling. #debates
Trump's soon going to interrupt Hillary by sticking his tongue out and going myaa mya yayayaya yadadada pfffft. #debatenight
Get him Lester. He did all that gum popping about the birth certificate for years, but now he's done talking about it #Debates2016
No admission of guilt, doesn't mean your innocent you jack arse #Debates2016
What world is @hillaryclinton living in? So out of touch with the struggles and violence in our nation’s cities. #debates
Trump Orders Entire Tyler Perry Collection on Amazon Prime Last Week #debatenight
Oh wow did anybody guess he would talk about the emails? #DebateNight
Don-Don's not doing a great job of looking presidential. Started out okay in the first 90 seconds... #debatenight #imwithher
Let me predict Donald's response: "Putin's semen tastes great. He really has a great dick. I love sucking it. Tremendous." #debatenight
I believe all of this is ridiculous and they're both trash. #Debates
If anyone is playing drink when we says 'we're losing' TAKE THIER KEYS #drunktweetthedebate #PresidentialDebate #debatenight
Donald's going round and round with his various sound bites on this...what's his actual plan? Does he have one? #debatenight
Trump asking what's the time on Hillary speech like it's a Battle Rap 😂 #debatenight @urltv
Why is it seen as "mean" when Trump question's a Mexican judge's impartiality towards him? He's 100% correct. #debatenight
Release 33K emails and Goldman Sachs transcript Hillary, &amp; Trump will release tax return. Slam dunk Trump! #debatenight
20 pages of tax return and 33 thousand emails? Release both, fair deal. #debatenight
Shocking, Trump supporters in the audience choose to be disrespectful while the other side is trying to be fair. #DebateNight
"I take advantage of the laws of the nation" - this ladies&amp;gentlemen of the USA could be your next #president #trump #debates #godhelpus
Glad Hillary is calling out trump on being a con man #debatenight
If @realDonaldTrump and @HillaryClinton don't shut up when @LesterHoltNBC says to stop, he should be able to cut their mics! #Debates2016
"It's about time someone who knows about money runs this country." I agree completely! Vote @GovGaryJohnson #Debates2016 #LetGaryDebate
You must be hiding something if you dont share tax returns OR emails #neverTrump #neverHillary @paupodcast #Debates2016
I think Donald just bragged about not paying taxes and being smart for that... #DebateNight #trump
Honestly, Donald is going to get us killed. That's my take on that. #debatenight
So I've learned tonight that #Trump has properties in Charlotte, Chicago,  palm beach, DC, Bronx, and Queens. #Debates2016
If you want to know if Donald cares about your town, see if he owns property there. That's how he proves he cares. #Debates
Fifth time for Hillary giving a complex answer, and for the seventh time Donald changes the subject. #Debates
HRC Stop and Frisk was found to be unconstitutional - i believe in community policing. Violent crime is 1/2 of what it was in '91 #debates
The blacks and Hispanics are the only ones to commit crime in America if you let Donald Trump tell it. #debatenight #debates #Debates2016
Where's Anderson Cooper? We would be on schedule if he were moderating. Sorry, Les. #debatenight
1/2 We must address terror attacks based on evidence, not single out an entire group of people based on their faith. #debatenight
"That makes me smart." - @realDonaldTrump straight-up bragging about not contributing to our federal government/society. #debatenight
Why won't Hillary release her speech transcripts? How do we know she made the income on her tax returns legitimately?  #debatenight
#debatenight this is real life people it's insane to think that parties VAST membership NO ONE WANTS TO RUN
He gets audited every year?  And we haven't asked WHY? #debatenight
Trumpets are like those clowns in the woods. Laughing at everything Trump says and SUPER SCARY #debatenight
#debatenight Drinking game: Shot ever time HRC says Trumped up Trickle down.
I would also like to announce my baby was sleeping before #debatenight started. That made the wine possible
Now Hillary is playing down Black violence, what a horrid hypocrite #debatenight
Donald Trump hands down is not qualified to be our next President. Period.  #debatenight
Yes, HRC, we know what we NEED...but what are you going to DO? #moneywhereyourmouthis #enoughlipservice #Debates2016
Both of these mfs lost in the sauce if you ask me. #debatenight
Hillary's think cloud - "This is can't be my life...I'm really up against him?  Where did I go wrong? #debatenight
Anyone who votes for Donald Trump needs to have their head examined. Hillary has exposed him the fraud that he is. #DebateNight
.@HillaryClinton says Russia is using cyber attacks to attack America. While Trump praises Putin. #truth #debates2016 #debatenight
He couldn't even lead Kevin McCallister to the lobby - yet people want him to lead this country? #Debates2016
The Debate should be run like a WWE promo, maybe then I could stand to watch it. @TheRock for president! #DebateNight
Trump is taking advantage of the laws of the nation. That's why he doesn't pay taxes. Genius. #Debates2016
"Plague of gun violence" is definitely the best description I've heard so far #Debates2016
Listen man... this man is bullshitting his supporters and they deserve better.  Just listen to this rambling nonsense.   #Debates2016 #fb
Trump courageously defends Reagan style trickle down economics, debunked numerous time. #debatenight
Trump thinks ISIS has been around since Hillary was a teenager? #debatenight
Millennials: let's watch this debate and add snapchat filters to the presidential candidates. #debatenight
@HillaryClinton do you know that police officers started out capturing "slaves" that escaped #Debates2016
If @realDonaldTrump gets elected, many of you black folks are going to loose your white privilege #Debates2016
@realDonaldTrump doesnt pay taxes because he is smart,  I guess the Middle Class is a bunch of dumb asses.  #debates #Debates2016
Let her talk Trump we want to hear her lie too damn. #debatenight
@teresacalhoun @HillaryClinton I use what is given in the tax laws to save as much as I can! So you don't? You give extra? #debatenight
Can't believe I'm a few months one for these idiots is gonna be the leader of the free world. We are fucked. #DebateNight #FUBAR #USA
#debatenight Could have slipped with the profiling question but she's treading lightly
@jenniferweiner What we did was not illegal...in the countries we committed those acts in #debatenight #halftrue
I feel bad for Lester... The people at NBC probably played rock, paper, scissors on who had to host this and he lost so hard #debatenight
Donald, invents his own truth.  Will never be forthright  #debatenight
He's gonna have to pee soon, he's drinking so much water,  just like Marco Rubio. #debatenight
Woof. Was not prepared for that level of open racism in a debate for THE LEADER OF THE FREE WORLD #Debates2016
#debatenight ??? I haven't heard a damn bit of policy from #Trump. Way to go @Reince @GOP...Real genius.
'That made me smart' Nope it made you a frigging con #Debates2016
.@realDonaldTrump hasn't changed tactics. Still arguing with the moderator for the sake of more airtime. #Debates2016 #debatenight
@FrankLuntz @realdonaldtrump is at his core a complainer and a narcissist, beginning, middle and end. That will not change. #debatenight
He just talking out of his ASS.  Over and over. Has NO stream of consciousness. #debatenight
DONALD TRUMP I HAVE ALWAYS LOVED YOU BUT NEVER HAVE I LOVED YOU MORE THAN TONIGHT  THANK YOU FOR FIGHTING FOR US! YOU ARE 4 US  #debatenight
#Debates2016 This starting point has been debunked so many times that it's a joke.
Lmfao he sound like a real Caucasian talking bout we shoulda stole the oil #debatenight #StopTheTrumpTrain #Debates2016
It's like we are still living in the 90's when we have come along way. #debates
Did @realDonaldTrump just advocate taking away guns to curb violence after he defended stop and frisk? #debatenight -J
Oh boy backs of the little guys.. Just great more for the poor.. #debatenight #Trump #Hillary is a socialist hater
ok so Trump's plan on cyber security is that his 10 year old son will take care of it, right?! #debates
Trump wants "the money" to be brought back in here to be put in to the inner cities and its the Secretary of State's fault???? #debatenight
I haven't even been listening to the past 15 minutes of #debatenight, I've just been re-reading my best tweets from the summer.
@PolitiFact and sooo in conclusion trump lies biggest surprise of the night-NOT! #DebateNight #ImWithHer
He just fact checked the moderator. I think my head might explode #ImWithHer #DebateNight
is this debate even real? He's just coming up with excuses to make fun of her and not answering anything #Debates2016
Instead of his tax returns, why aren't we demanding @realDonaldTrump's birth certificate? #birther #debate #debates2016
So I'm going to sleep because it's the same shit over and over again. Goodnight fam ✌🏼️ #Debatenight
Hey Clinton it was YOU that raised the birther lie against Obama in YOUR campaign #hypocrite #clintonvstrump #debatenight #debates2016
@realDonaldTrump has fallen in2 the trap of debating on @HillaryClinton 's issues. She's setting them up &amp; he's following #debatenight
"A man that can be provoked by a tweet should not be anywhere near nuclear weapons." -@HillaryClinton #debatenight
trump: "... not in a braggadocious way..." me: "yeah because it was in a bragga-DOUCHE-ious way" dad: "I've taught you well" #DebateNight
come live in canada! we have free health care and a hot prime minister #debatenight
Donald, so do gangs shoot up elementary schools, theaters and nightclubs? #debatenight
"I settled that lawsuit with no admission of guilt" should totally put the "@realDonaldTrump is a racist" thing to bed, right? #debatenight
"I haven't given much thought to NATO"  What HAS @realDonaldTrump given thought to?  #debatenight
Free tuition for you, your pets, and your houseplants will make the economy explode, or something, says @HillaryClinton #debatenight
This orange oompa loompa is talking about making America great again yet he made a casino go bankrupt. You degenerate inbred. #debates
Hillary should have brought her fact checkers to her FBI interview #debatenight
Trump keeps saying "excuse me" as if the moderator is being rude.  No, Donald, you're being rude. #debatenight
Someone needs to take Obama's birth certificate and shove it up Trump's ass. #Debates2016
Why does Trump hate this country so much?  True, we need some work, but jeez. . . .  #debatenight
So Trump is sort of arguing that racism doesn't exist, but use a racist policy to combat crime . . . #debatenight
Sorry it's #MNF for me. Can't watch the debate. I get highlights later. #DebateNight #ifeelforourcountry
T: 4000 ppl have been killed since Obama took office!   Yep. You caught him. He killed all of them. It was his master plan. #Debates2016
Am I the only one annoyed at Trump's pronunciation of "terror" as "terra"? #Debates2016
#Debates2016 Trump didn't answer how he would make businesses that have already moved abroad return to America.
Did Hillary prep? This is putting this moron in the White House. #DebateNight
Finally this opportunity to see these 2 side by side. No media commentary, he said, she said. Are you listening, America? #debatenight #vote
"Democrats are controlling and abusing the minorities for votes" literally who is letting him open his face #debates
She's just called him racist.  Say goodnight folks. Hilary is disrespectful. #debatenight
Nope. You're wrong. I'm right.   I'm gonna try @realDonaldTrump's tactics on my college professors and see if that works  #debatenight
Skyrocketing murder rate is an unintended consequence of an otherwise successful economy in urban area? Hillary, are u high??!! #Debates2016
How can Hillary fix race relations when she thinks young black males are "Super Predators?" #Trump #Hillary #Debates2016
Not really impressed with the #debates questions. Feels like they printed off the questions off of #Yahoo. Need better questions.
@realDonaldTrump is killing it! We are watching our next #POTUS call out the mess #CrookedHillary is a part of &amp; to blame! #debatenight
Trump how about you pay all the people you hired for jobs first instead of threatening to deport them so you can save a few bucks. #debates
Trump is so self centered I can't believe he has to add in that he's smart for tax evasion, hoping for people's homes to be lost. #debates
My Wife: "Sean Hannity couldn't be reached because there's poor reception in your colon." ❤ #Debates2016
YOU ARE BEING RUDE BY NOT LETTING HER SPEAK AND HAVE HER TURN YOU ZESTY LYING ORANGE.   #debatenight
Wow, Trump missed that one. All he had to mention in rebuttal to cyber security was Hillary's email server. #debates #PresidentialDebate
If you aren't at home listening to Trump saying WHAT? The DEA owes you a visit #Debates2016 #Debates2016 #justsayno
Hillary just said some neighborhoods do not abide by the law. Haha true but still. Not helpful. #debatenight #Debates2016
Gangs are kind of... hard to take down. And they also don't hand over guns willingly. #Debates
If you're watching these debates than you should be voting in November. #noexcuse #Vote #Election2016
Re Hilary's "Broadbased inclusive growth", will require broadbased access to ownership of productive assets.  #debatenight @HillaryClinton
There it is... "I'm somewhat relieved that my late father didn't do business for you..." #Clinton to #DontheCon #debatenight #Debates2016
He just has to mention the NRA... and how proud he is... of the NRA... and their blood money... #debates #debatenight #Debates2016
Deflection &amp; not answering the questions that are being asked sums up #debatenight. #SoDisappointing
Trump's only point of reference for cities in the US: "I have property there" #readabook #Debates2016
Donald trump is talking a lot but not saying anything 😔 #debatenight
But settling out of court I'd say, could be thought of as an admission of guilt... #Debates2016
Get yourself someone who looks at you like trump looks at Hillary #debatenight #Debates
Out there, there are some bars with the #debates on and and some angry football fan is yelling put the game on. #debatenight
It's called business Hilary. Don't get mad at a man who is living the American dream when you are not. #debatenight
"I have a much better temperament than her...I have a better temperament, a winning temperament."   I...what. #debatenight
"The city where I have investments" senseless bastard. That wasn't the time for that when my black brothers are being killed #debatenight
GIVE US THE RETURNS not your adjectives, not the names of your banks, not a summary... #debatenight
Did @realDonaldTrump teally just insult overweight people? OMG just when I thought it couldn't get worse. #debatenight
Problem is that people r referred to as BLACK Americans &amp; WHITE Americans. Those terms are the problem. We are ALL Americans. #Debates2016
Trump: You called young black super predators. It's horrible to call them that. #Debates2016
That's true, too. I'm NEVER forgetting - or forgiving - HRC for her treatment toward, then, Senator Obama. #debatenight
Hillary didn't you work with Osama bin laden in the late 1980's and early 1990's? That worked#debatenight #hillaryforprison @HillaryClinton
She got a laugh by saying "just listen to what you heard" wow   #debatenight
@realDonaldTrump: "We have to get NATO to go into the middle east with us...and knock the hell out of ISIS." #Debates2016
Trump wants america to become like him, hopefully it wont ^^  #debatenight
Enough said: if you are too dangerous to fly, you are too dangerous to buy a gun. #ImWithHer #MomsDemandHillary #Debates2016
HRC schooling Trump on nuclear proliferation, but he's still trying to figure out what the "triad" is... #debatenight
Trump says Clinton's emails are "disgraceful, and believe me this country thinks it's disgraceful also" #DebateNight
Trump: "African Americans and Hispanics are living in hell.. if you walk down the street you get shot" #Debates2016
@realDonaldTrump on @POTUS and birth certificate: "He should've produced it a long time before." #debatenight
@realDonaldTrump: "@POTUS and Sec. Clinton created a vacuum the way they got out of Iraq." #debatenight #debates
"and you know what else i prepared for, being PRESIDENT of the united states..." BAMM!!!!! #debatenight
"Stop and frisk is unconstitutional" Trump "you're wrong" BRUH!! The audacity!! #Debates2016
I'm tweeting on the cyber right now. This cyber is so cool. 😎 #Debates2016
I am literally watching a man #peeping a customer's #laptop screen. He's looking more and more #pissed. Must be the presidential #debates.
Donald's answers to questions about people he stiffed on business dealings says a lot. He's out for Trump and only Trump. #debates
If the whole president thing doesn't pan out, Trump could easily headline the Gathering of the Juggalos next year. #debatenight
It'd be hard to explain your opinions in the 2 min.cIt'll be interesting to see how their ideas develop in the upcoming debates as well.
When are we getting the tax returns now? After the 15 year audit? After the emails? After the lawyers say so? #Debates2016
I cannot take anything off the table aka I'm gonna use nukes cause I can #debatenight
Trump "Very lightly" was for the war in Iraq.  Lol.  #DebateNight #TrumpOnCOKE #debatenight
Don't let him off the hook, the IRS said nothing was stopping him because of an audit.  #debatenight
Trump: I have better temperament than Hillary. Fact Check: THIS ENTIRE DEBATE. #debatenight
Love that Hillary isn't sinking to Trump's level. Keep that poker face! #debatenight #HillaryClinton
#ImWithHer but I’m actually feeling sorry for Trump he’s doing so poorly. “$650 million is not a lot of money” #DebateNight
I really don't think any American can take Hillary seriously when she talks about foreign policy... #Benghazi #debates
OMG Hillary is lecturing us on cyber security after not knowing what the c meant or "wiping" the server "with a cloth?" #debatenight
NOOOO! She should have calmly talked down to him!!!!!!!!! No "Whoo! OK!" @latimesopinion @jedshug @DavidLat @CBHessick #debatenight
In answering a question on race, Trump touts his endorsement by the Fraternal Order of Police #debates
Trump cannot talk about disrespecting anyone you literally disrespect entire ethnicities every time you open your mouth #debatenight
None of these two give a shit about the legions of people in the inner city to struggle every day to stop #blackonblackcrime #debatenight
Trump's subcontractors built a hotel so let's make him President? Help me or with this one @GOP... #debatenight
It's was ruled unconstitutional.  No it wasn't.   Well, that's that! #debatenight
Trump clearly hasn't seen The Italian Job, James Bond, Live Free Or Die Hard, or The Matrix #400Pounds #debatenight #debates #Debates2016
My Snapchat feed is full of faceswaps and filters on the candidates 😂😂 #debatenight
He just doesn't have an off button...it's just the same bullshit over and over #debatenight
I'm confused. What has Donald actually said in the past 15 minutes? #debatenight
"Maybe he didn't do a good job" is a reason to not pay someone for their work now? Okay. #debates2016
"I have a tremendous income" YET AT ZERO% HE'S NOT WILLING TO PAY HIS FAIR SHARE IN TAXES! Trump is a world class FlimFlam Man.#debatenight
#debatenight - Trump such a child, boiling down his argument on tax returns to SHOW ME YOURS AND ILL SHOW YOU MINE
Trump "they talk good" why is this man running for president?? #DebateNight
"I will release my tax returns when she releases her 33 thousand emails."  BOOM HEADSHOT!!!  #debatenight
Actually, Hillary, it's been proven over and over that he didn't support invading Iraq. But yea, "listen and believe". #debatenight #debates
Trump can turn this cyber security issue onto to Clinton by focusing on her own security failures... #debatenight
Smile Donald, smile!  And please stop yelling. It may help you recover. #debatenight #imwithher
"You single out hispanic and black people" called trump on his shit #debatenight
But what about the Oxford Comma? These are the questions we need answered! #debatenight
All Trump talks about is where he owns property &amp; all the investments he has made. Glad that is his focus in this debate #debatenight
#debatenight Trump is out of breath! Many more rounds coming! Hope he doesn't have a heart attack before this ends!
Have either of them ever done a police ride along?  #doubtit #Debates2016
I don't even want to know what they have to say about race. #Debates2016
Clinton destroyed Trump on Libya. Wow. He looks like a fool  #debatenight #debate2016 #debates
"Gun free" Chicago has had 4K deaths from guns. That hasn't been solved. #Debates2016 #debatenight
Hey Killary, how about an apology to the families of the 4 killed in Bengazhi? #debatenight
Does Donald know that he can't debate with Lester when he fact checks him?? #debates
There's a reason why the mainstream media exist.  Credibility.  Fox "News" is not news.  #Debates2016 Don't Know needs vocabulary lessons.
Are we all going to receive the counseling &amp; support we need following this debate? #debatenight #Debates2016 #PresidentialDebate
All this arguing. This kind of feels like Thanksgiving dinner. Mostly because Hillary is wearing my outfit from last year. #debatenight
I can't BELIEVE that Obama is the one behind three thousand or four thousand shootings in Chicago. How does he have the time?? #debatenight
Those guns just walk around shooting people on their own, right Hillary?#Debates
Who pays 73% of the cost of NATO?  Not @realDonaldTrump #debates. Doesn't Pay federal taxes "because he smart"
Hmm criminal justice...does this mean you'll exonerate the black folk you put in prison in the 90s?? 👀#DebateNight
Original law and order, or SVU, or CI? Remember that Olivia is only in one. #debatenight #LawAndOrderSVU #lawandorder
Take guns away from blacks because again white people dont shoot up schools or mom and dad   #debatenight
This is landslide victory for Clinton. However, she was facing an idiot so it wasn't too difficult for her #debatenight
The Donald is wearing her out on what we learned from the DNC hack #debatenight
@tjholmes ummm no good time 4 Lester to take his belt off &amp; whoop DT's behind!! All over the place  #debatenight #attheplayground #foolish
trump has great temperament. didnt think  i'd be hearing jokes tonight #Debates2016 #debatenight #DebateNight #cats
Is "interpretive dance of rage" a thing? Because I'm fucking Twyla Tharp right now. #debatenight
Two 1%rs masquerading as public servants on a 1%owned propaganda station masquerading as journalism #sheep #debatenight
Can someone please call Hillary &amp; Trump out on the fact that they're both okay with drone strikes?! No one?! Ight #debatenight
Trying to watch #MNF and #debatenight at the same time is harder than my physics homework
Donald Trump will not let go of this. He is lying. He supported the war in Iraq. #debatenight

Ummmm, for the record, Palm Beach is a neighborhood that is for SUPER rich white people. Yes, Trump is VERY proud to be there. #Debates2016
Could you imagine Trump if he had to deal for foreign diplomats? Would he bully and talk over them too? #debates
What does this palm beach club have to do with anything? What in the entire FUCK?!? #debatenight
He did a great job for the president by those birther lies?! #debatenight
Guys, he's been all over! He's been all over! Can I get a vote for travel mileage? #debatenight

@Chaosxsilencer  Hillary winning... he's just bluster and interrupting her during HER two minutes. #debatenight
No fly list is extrajudicial. Use it to deny a constitutional right! Fuck you @HillaryClinton #debates
Bleached Muskrat Man practicing racism on the daily, he's getting pretty good at it. #Debates2016 #DebateNight
"I talk to Sean Hannity" = I talk to the voices in my head that totally confirm all my racism and bigotry #debatenight
Him: MY TEMPERAMENT IS THE GREATEST Her: here's a specific example of how mine is actually better for this job #debatenight
"Why am I feeling this way?" Because prejudices are inherited through example and experience. #StopAssuming #Debates
can't wait for SNL to use this as an opener in their next episode #Debates2016
Ra Ra Sis Boom Bah. Both are right and should work together. Both are good and bad. Make them team up   #Debates
We should have left 10k troops or something like that in Iraq #makeitupasigoalong #Debates2016 @realDonaldTrump
"You know what else I've prepared for? Being president of the United States," says Clinton. "Eyeroll," says Trump's face #debatenight
I don't remember consenting to an extended scene with a couple a doms who don't know what a safe word is. #debates
Meanwhile, @PortlandPolice is asking people not to consume too much alcohol or marijuana as a result of this debate. 😂😂😂 #debatenight
#SecondChance @HillaryClinton? Have you not seen the domestic abuse in the news?  Murderers getting out and killing more. Wtf #Debates2016
Yelling over her does nothing. He got ugly fast. #Debates2016 She's staying so calm. "This is Secretary Clinton's 2 min" Keep him in check!
Yes, you better call out his birther lying as racist @HillaryClinton Thank you! #debatenight
I wish Trump was like Pinocchio. His nose would be so long. #CallSeanHanity #debatenight
#debatenight You walk down a street in the inner city and you get shot? How is anyone still alive? #Trumpsucks
Take so far: Trump is rattled and nervous, Clinton remains calm and collected.  She knows the game. #MCdb8 #debatenight #Decision2016
#debates As much as you may hate him, Donald Trump is still a savage. "Wrong, wrong , wrong"
Trump says he's developed a good relationship with the black community over "the last little while" #debates
Stop and frisk always hurts minorities. Always.  When we start stop and frisking people who look like him, then I'm in #debatenight
Is "no admission of guilt" the same as innocent?  Just curious. #Debates2016
FACT CHECK. Did @realDonaldTrump just claim America invented the internet?#debatenight Astounding international relations as always!!
"I take responsibility." That's what leaders do. Hillary is a leader! #debatenight
He's losing his temper about how much money he has.  His hands are tiny too.  #debatenight
CLINTON: "I have met a lot of the people who were stiffed by you and your businesses..."  Boom.  #debatenight
Donald has repeated the same things for this entire debate like what #debates
@abbeyrolled @HillaryClinton @WhitfordBradley Bring me the finest muffins and bagels in all the land! #ImWithHer #debatenight
I wonder what hole @BarackObama will live on when he leaves the White House. He seems like a 9th hole kind of guy. 😂😂😂 #golfcourse #debates
Everyone outside of the US must be laughing their asses off right now. This is a train wreck. #debatenight #debates
"police brutality, tax invasion, you're denial of obama being a US citizen??" NIGGA ISIS!!! #Debates
Debate Dictonary: "Essentially financial statement of sorts" = what a con artist calls a tax return. #debatenight
"I opened a club and nobody sued for discrimination! Gimme a cookie!" #debatenight
Hey @realDonaldTrump you should smile. You look less angry when you smile. #Debates
"A man that can be provoked by a tweet, should not have his fingers anywhere near the nuclear codes." #preach #debatenight
Hillary on the emails: "I take responsibility for that.." Mr Trump: "ummmm" #debatenight
Not paying federal income taxes "makes me smart" says the guy wanting to be a public servant paid through federal taxes #debatenight
Hey @NBCNews, the fluctuations in the volume on the @YouTube feed are very distracting #debatenight
Is he really bragging about opening a club that doesn't discriminate? #Debates2016
Trump: "Nuclears are the single greatest threat of this time - not #ClimateChange or #GlobalWarming." #debatenight   He cannot win!!
How exciting is it that our first female presidential candidate and first moron candidate are on stage together debating? #debatenight
NATO countries should pay their fair share, but to avoid paying your fair share of taxes makes you smart. #debatenight
Oh shit son, were into the race part, let's see how fast Trump pivots away #debatenight #Debates2016
According to trump, Obama caused 4000 gun deaths in Chicago 🙄🤔😳 #debatenight
The problem is that you cannot stop criminals from getting guns no matter what.  #Debates

A vote to make commercials in this debate bc lord I need a break #Debates2016
I believe cyber privacy-.. Cyber security.." Oops. Kinda slipped there eh Hilary? Her earpiece malfunctioning? #debates
Getting the support of the police force isn't a good thing right now, Donald. How are you that stupid?! #debatenight
If Trump don't shut the hell up and let Hillary talk. Didn't you hear the announcer? It's HER turn! #debatenight
Hillary has command of the facts and policy. Trump can barely stand still. #debatenight
Donald makes the black and Latino communities sound like the worst places ever #debatenight
I laughed VERY MUCH OUT LOUD when he said "Sidney Blumenthal" LOVE HOW HE'S STILL NEWS #debates

Please shut the fuck up about the debates. hillary is a piece of shit, and trump is a piece of shit as well.
I have a winning temperament &lt;as I'm yelling and cutting the moderator off&gt; #debatenight #debate #IStandWithHer
"I opened a club that let people of color in and I deserve credit for it." -@realDonaldTrump #debatenight #racism
#Debates resume: Trump yelling and making up facts, and Hilary trying very hard to not call him a super asshole
Hillary made it clear that she doesn't agree with the way African Americans are treated. Yet trump avoids the conversation. 🤔 #debatenight
Trump supporters demonize HRC for being ill. Isn't that him sniffling and snorting? #debatenight #debates
Debate winner? The alcohol companies as a result of all the #debatedrininkinggames #debates #debatenight
This is a debacle for Trump. He is embarrassing himself. He will not show for the 2nd debate. #debatenight #debates
I like how Clinton just used the word "caviler" and Trump 2 minutes had to use it. #Debates
.@realDonaldTrump wants other countries to pay for things, but he won't pay his federal taxes. #Debates2016
She talks on his tax returns to take the heat of her emails come on Hillary we the deplorables are not as dumb as you think #debatenight
Tax cuts for the wealthy YES!! That's what the middle class needs!! #debates
He said he has a much better temperament than her. And the whole crowd laughed 😂😂😂😂😂 #debatenight
Clinton takes too much joy in attacking Trump. She needs to rise above and push him on details. #wonkout #debatenight
You keep mentioning UR "694 million" to help, since Ur talking about "change" donate some of yours!! #debatenight
Trump has a 10 year old son? i dont pay attention to him but this is news #debatenight
has anyone else noticed how much Trump brings dollar amounts into his answers #debatenight
Both made good points about the other's character problems. Yet we have no other choice? @GovGaryJohnson @CNN #debatenight #debates
@KellyannePolls must have used an entire stick of deodorant in the last 75 minutes. #debatenight
"My company is the shit, people love me, and I'm building my own White House" @realDonaldTrump #debatenight #PresidentialDebate #wut
So we have like 30 minutes left...I feel like I'm in detention. Almost done, everyone.   #debates
I appreciate everyone pointing out lies in the #debatenight, but that's not enough to win. Sad we live in a society that doesn't value truth
There are actual adults watching this debate, hanging on every word like it's the Super Bowl. #WeAreFucked #Debates2016
@brentdougherty called for Les Miles to be the moderator and I agree. Lester lost control in the first segment. #letsYell #Debates2016
Who does Clinton owe money to? She's no cleaner than Trump! #DebateNight
Hillary's dress is dyed red with the blood of her enemies #Debates2016 #Trump
Another thing I know about Internet people: they don't like being called 400 pnd bed sitters. Good luck getting your site back up. #debates
Blah blah blah @HillaryClinton ...laugh n do whatever but @realDonaldTrump will be the next President of The United States #debatenight
"We need to cooperate with Muslim communities in America and abroad" What? #debates
The #debatenight picture looks kinda like a toilet and it totes appropriate
What her emails have to do with your Tax returns ?? #Debates2016
Is there a mercy rule in presidential debates? Seems like @realDonaldTrump could really use one #debatenight
@LesterHoltNBC why do you keep asking why he supported war when he didn't?  Trying to save @HillaryClinton #Debates2016
Lester: Hillary, what do u think of racism? Hillary: Racism is wrong! Lester: Trump, explain Malinowski's Theorem in detail. 🙄 #Debates2016
@HillaryClinton facial expressions of disgust everytime Trump opens his blowhole are giving me life. #Debates2016
Please stop using the black community as a scapegoat to make your deplorable supporters feel comfortable @realDonaldTrump #debatenight
#debatenight @realDonaldTrump you are taking credit for business decisions managers and employees made. You didn't make this decisions!
I am seriously concerned for my students, who may be dead—or at least gravely ill—after debate drinking games. #debates
Cyber warfare: "It could also be somebody sitting on his bed weighing 400 pounds . . . "  Hey, HEY!  Fat jokes?? Really?  debatenight
all trump does is attack her n be immature meanwhile shes remaining calm n being respectful. That tells you all you need to kno #debatenight
The question is about how to combat terrorism at home, why do they both keep gravitating to what's going on overseas? #debatenight
Donald Trump saying the US is a "third world country" shows just how fucking out of touch with the rest of the world he is #Debates2016
What does the birther issue that Hillary started have to do with racism? I'm confused.  #Debates
I wonder why he haven't cut her off yet🤔 he probably thinking what he gonna say.. you betta be careful📍 #debatenight
"A man who can be provoked by a tweet should not have his fingers near the nuclear codes." - Hillary Clinton #debates #boom
"I prepared to be president, and I think that's a good thing." Fuckin' right. #ImWithHer #debatenight
another old white man speaking on behalf of african-american people everywhere, that's rich #debatenight
"Woooh okay" -Hillary Clinton. I want this engrave in my tombstone. #debatenight
I did an interview w/ Howard Stern. Very lightly. Maybe a little. Indirectly. Eh. Maybe not...I SPOKE TO SEAN HANNITY! #Debate #Debates2016
Trump says he's going to bring jobs back. Can he bring his golf courses back??? #Debates2016
Wah Wah Wah  I get audited nobody else does  #debatenight
'I settled that lawsuit with no admission of guilt.' (But I was guilty as fuuuuuuck) - @realDonaldTrump #debate #debatenight
oh my god he wants to stop and frisk BLACK PEOPLE #Debates2016
How can someone who says that not paying tax is smart make any pretension to care about public welfare? #debatenight #Trump
#Debates @realDonaldTrump to Clinton "You don't know you broke into DNC."  Cyber security is a problem. US should be better than anyone else
Now Trump fat shames hackers 😆😭😂. Anonymous, y'all better get him! #debatenight
I wonder if trump is physically able to shut his mouth for more than 10 seconds #debatenight
Two blue-eyed, blonde, rich white Americans gonna talk about race relations in America ☕️🐸#DebateNight
YOURE A FUCKING CRIMINAL TRUMP. You shift admitted you're smart for not paying your taxes #debatenight
Stop &amp; frisk is not racial profiling. It's criminal profiling. Period. #debatenight
Lester stand up for yourself! Put the bully in his place!! #debates
'I think implicit bias is inherent to more than the police,' #HillaryClinton #debatenight
I wish this debate would talk about the real facts: the US government silenced Harambe #Debates2016
wait. you didn't support the war, but you said we should've taken all their oil?#debates
NO, DUMBALD. For the LAST TIME, taking Iraq's oil would constitute a war crime!!! #factcheck2016 #debates #debatenight #Debates2016
Saturday Night Live (@nbcsnl), you are welome. Your shows are written for the rest of the year #somuchmaterial #debatenight
I'm so comforted that Trump knows who the "bad people" are #debatenight
#Debates Who is "we" @HillaryClinton.  Are you flying down to each of these cities and calling meetings?
Hillary Clinton baiting Trump at every opportunity and it seems to be working #debatenight
Yes! @HillaryClinton goes to da hood all the time, yo! She's down with you #SuperPredators. -mao #debatenight #Debates2016 #MAGA #Trump
Wasn't one of the goals to get the millennial vote? They are the internet users.#debatenight
Yeah, I prepared for this debate AND I'm prepared to be president!   GIVE @HillaryClinton a mic to drop, yo!!!  #Debates2016 #debates
Hey, America, Donald Trump wants to move on from the conspiracy he helped start and fan because he can blame Hillary now.  #Debates
Wait, Donald, you trust the generals you know more about?!?!?  #Debates #Debates2016
#PresidentialDebate watchers should switch to #RAW where talking actually leads to punching and kicking. #debatenight
The choice is clear. @HillaryClinton is thoughtful, smart, cogent, kind. She is a leader. @realDonaldTrump is not. #ImWithHer #Debates2016
Oh shit it just hit me #Trumps sniffles remind me of them old coke heads in the bars downtown. #debatenight #debates
Thank God it's my bed time I have had enough of this #debatenight
Not paying taxes "makes you smart"?!?  Who wouldn't want this man in control? 🙄#DebateNight
Lets ask two rich white people about race... ready... go  #debatenight
Ok back to me not watching the debates like I've never done before!
But then again you think climate change is a hoax, Donald ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ #debatenight
Oh he did NOT just describe Charlotte as “a city in which [he] has investments.” #debatenight
I didn't think I could hate Trump anymore than I already do, this debate has proven me wrong. #debates
And why are you doubting that Obama is even a citizen to begin with..? #Debatenight #We'reScrewed
If you have to raise your voice, you already lost the argument #debates
It's too bad you can't run this country like your horrible businesses... #debatenight
Where does this guy get his damn info???.....I need to know even more #Confused #ByHisToupee #Debates
Did Hilary just say that everybody is in someway racist? The fuck!? #Debates2016
He didnt even answer the question about race and police brutality 😒#debatenight
How many times is Trump going to say "Believe me?" We're not going to believe in your b.s. just because you tell us to. #debatenight
Trump keeps focusing on Clinton's e-mail scandal because he doesn't have any plans to present to the American people😒🙄 #debatenight
"We have to bring back law and order," Trump says repeatedly without detailing specific plans. #debatenight
I want to live in a world where Obama's birth certificate is no longer a point of discussion. #debatenight
I would bet a small loan that @realDonaldTrump is the worst Taboo player in the history of words. #Election2016 #Debates2016
Obama is HALF black, his father was absent and NOT American so... #debatenight
Y'all remember when Trump said Obama the founder of Isis and Hillary the co founder 😭😂 #debatenight
Both candidates couldn't be more out of touch with Americans. It's embarassing. #NeverTrump #NeverHillary #debatenight
Trump is flustered. He is turning a darker shade of orange.  It matches Hillary's sausage casing suit #NeverTrump #NeverHillary #debatenight
"You know what else I've prepared for? I've prepared to be the President of the United States." -H   What a moment! #debatenight
my dissertation is going to be on mass incarceration in America vs U.K so my girlie is giving me notes #debatenight
Any progress that was made on anything was because @realDonaldTrump suggested it. #thingsilearned from #debatenight
Not sure that "shimmy" move is gonna do it lady!  #WTFWasThat #Debates2016 #LesserOfTwoEvils 😑
The fact he calls her secretary Clinton 😂😂😂 #Debates2016 he damn near calling her a janitor
Holt questions Trump &amp; Clinton about domestic terrorism &amp; homegrown attacks #debatenight #NovIsComing #ypempowered @ypnulem
#Debates Are they paying Trump to be @ the debate ...He does nothing for free including charities ...
The IRS has clearly stated that he can release his tax returns despite the audit. Jesus Christ. #debatenight
Now hit him with a good Putin line and he's done. #debatenight
Trump is just using his answers to let the American people know where the fuck he has property #DebateNight
The best sign I saw during the @ChicagoHalf If trump can run so can you #debatenight
"I have a much better temperament than her" says the man who can't stop interrupting people #debatenight
Can someone find out where Hillary got her outfit from? We can guarantee it's not middle class affordable. #debates2016 #YRWatchParty #YRNF
#debatenight Trump just said he is for stop &amp; frisk. I am for that 2 as long as you stop &amp; frisk everybody &amp; not 1 specific group.
"I'm being audited" "The IRS says you can release them while being audited" "But I'm being audited" #debates
Trump is 100% that drunk family member at Thanksgiving we're all embarrassed by. #debates
#FACT: @realDonaldTrump DISRESPECTS women. He said it himself in a TV commercial. #debatenight #Debates2016   #Debates
Donald Trump: "Under President Obama, we've lost control of thing we used to have control of." #debatenight
This debate is great and all but can we meet the real candidates now? #debatenight
"no they were taunting us" who cares. you're trying to become president, effectively controlling the world, why would you care? #debatenight
#debatenight I had an economy teacher who told us to "take advantage of the laws of the country."  He would point out his own business!
"Yes, I prepared for this debate. You know what else I prepared for? Being President." Yeah!  #debates
If gangsters stopped shooting each other for quick cash, the world would be a better place. #debatenight
Wtf is he even saying? I cannot understand one word of stupidity. #NeverTrump #debatenight
Wow. Trump wants "Stop and Frisk" federally. I thought he was Republican? #debatenight
End private prisons at the state level nationwide. Nobody should have a profit motive to put our neighbors in cages. #imwithher #debatenight
Lester, my dear. Sit up straight and take control of this. #debatenight
Ohhhh crap Hillary is laying the smack down. "Or MAYBE he isn't as charitable as he says he is?????" #Debates
"You decided to stay Home and that's okay." Trump on Hillary preparing for the debates. #DebateNight #whitesagainsttrump
Are we really playing the same game as ISIS, or is it just Trump's kid? #debatenight
#debatenight Man, this is like listening to a debate between an encyclopedia and a hyena with rabies.
Clinton talks about working with the police and cracking down on guns, and Trump accuses her of not caring about Law and Order #debates
"fighting isis your entire adult life" I'm sorry since she was EIGHTEEN? FOR FIFTY YEARS?? Um… no? #debatenight
Honestly trump says so many crazy things no one would bat an eye if he used a private email #debatenight
OMG he says his temperament is his best asset. Holy cow! #debatenight #debates
Did Trump just say not paying taxes makes him smart!!! #debatenight    This guy is beyond big ego #debates
"I'm taking advantage of the laws of the nation." @realDonaldTrump says in response to paying low wages #DebateNight #MIMConnect
What the? Did he just blame @POTUS for thousands of people being killed? The main is insane #debatenight
"You may be endorsed by the police but you've also been endorsed by the KKK" #Debates2016 #StopInterrupting2k16 #OHHillYes @XUdems
Can the next debate be a Battle Rap please. Pretty please #debatenight
Trump clearly came in with a plan to be subdued and presidential. And that plan clearly fell apart after about 1 exchange #debates
All I can think when trump speaks is that 41% of Americans believe his lies! #debates2016 #debatenight
But I thought ISIS has been around for all of Clinton's adult life? #Debates2016
steal their oil donald? THEIR OIL? that's gunna take a pretty big bowl...it's ok, we'll make isis pay for it. #debatenight #tyt
Man, if I was @realDonaldTrump I would've punched this BITCH in the face by now lol #ShutUp! #Debates
"Stop and frisk is illegal" "but Nah" is the equivalent of "Jackson u can't kill all those native Americans" "but Nah" #debatenight
are you seriously bitching about airports? what's next, AIRLINE FOOD? mother. fucker. A THIRD WORLD COUNTRY?!??!! Oh my god. #debatenight
#debates  How many times did he say Sean Hannity in his excuse about war in Iraq? New bromance?
Should we take a shot every time Hilary says, "Let's start the clock again Lester..."? #debates
THIS WOMAN IS A FUCKING QUEEN. I would've lit the stage on fire like 30 minutes and 45 mansplainings ago. #debatenight
We don't know what his tax records are BUT we absolutely know that her decisions cost the lives of brave Americans!!!! #Debates2016
Up next: Donald takes on race in America. This should be good. #debatenight #debates
#debatenight Russia,China,Dubai,Qatar,Iran,Iraq,Afghanistan et al is the central theme . Isn't this  is an American election. debate!
Clinton needs to address that "and the country thinks [the email deletions] are a disgrace" moment. It'll be a soundbyte. #debatenight
#debates Hillary was thinking about holding the rich accountable (while on Goldman board, housing crisis)
So Trump chose to flat out lie in a Presidential debate about his support for the Iraq war.  #debatenight
OHMIGOD WE GET IT YOU OWN PROPERTY EVERYWHERE JESUS TRUMP WE KNOW #debatenight
African Americans: RT if Trump has "developed a really good relationship" with you. #Debatenight
Hillary is coming w facts not assumptions of African American youth .. or as DTrump refers "Black Youth"   #debatenight
hearing trumps views on some of these topics just baffles me #PresidentialDebate #debatenight
funnyordie: The American people demanded it: two 70 year olds talking about cyber security. #debates
More gun laws are only going to increase incarceration rates, Hillary #debatenight
My drinking game is to take a drink every time Clinton or Trump begins speaking...because one of them is going to be president. #debatenight
imagine being mature and not yelling "wrong" at every statement or opinion that you dislike........trump can't relate. #debatenight
Trump, given YOUR performance in debates, you have NO right to talk about others being disrespectful and holier-than-thou.#debatenight
How Trump didn't crush her on emails there, I have no idea. #DebateNight
| Trump is being misleading. Tax experts say that tax returns provide insight about a person’s finances in several key areas.#debatenight
Trump is unhinged, Hillary is calm.  I like this.  #Debates2016
#Trump is #TrumpedUp he's busting at the seems but #Lester is not pressing 4 real answers #debatenight
Hillary's a robot with an earpiece.  Trump's talking without one.  #debates
Idk man, the @MTA managed to finish the R Train/Montague tunnel under budget and ahead of schedule. You're not that special, Trump. #debates
I refuse to cast my vote for anyone who thinks stop and frisk is a good idea. #debatenight
Lester is treating trump with kid gloves..."stop and frisk was a good thing"???? .... Really ??!! #PresidentialDebate #debatenight
"A man who gets provoked by a tweet, should not be anywhere near nuclear weapons." - Hillary Clinton on Trump. #Debates2016
Man, I feel so bad for Lester 😂😂 . It like a parent trying to defuse an argument between siblings. #debatenight
Trump could have excoriated Her on email scandal, left it on the table. #trumpfail #debates
this debate is actually hilarious until you realize that one of them is going to be president #DebateNight
I did the math and Trump literally makes 50 times my annual salary in one day... #Debates2016
Apparently, it's smart not to pay federal income tax. Hmm, I may never file again. My IQ is 167, what's yours? #debatenight #nomoretaxes
The crowd at Debate Bingo is silent when Hillary speaks. I love Portland! #debatenight #Portland
Trump's routine audit has been going for over a year now. Wonder if the I.R.S. even knows it's happening? #debatenight
If you say it loud enough, you'll always sound precocious - I don't release my tax returns but I'm not bragadocious! #debatenight
"That makes me smart": Donald Trump, ladies and gentlemen, calling us all chumps for paying taxes. #Debates2016
So tell us Trump, what experience do you have in THAT? #debatenight
These #debates aren't going to change anything  Anyone who is still following Trump up to this point isn't gonna be swayed by anything
#debates2016 - the audacity! We should have taken their Oil? Donald Trump
#Trump honestly believes he has the better #temperament than #Hillary to be president. He is so egomaniacal that he BELIEVES it #debatenight
Oh shit, fam — Hillary got this foo Trump shook rn!   #debatenight
Is @realDonaldTrump wearing a diaper? I hope so. His bladder won't be able take so much water. #Debates2016
So he just said he's worried about HIM and HIS family, not the country. #debatenight
I just feel like everyone in this race has no clue what they want to do with themselves. This is a race to be the most shadiest🌚#debatenight
you have a great relationship with African Americans but you loosing the black vote by 98% #Debates2016
We're a third world country? Does Donald know what a real third world country looks like? #debatenight
Still waiting on Donald's answer for how to stop cyber attacks... #debatenight
New drinking game: take a shot every time Trump answers w nothing but "Wrong" #debatenight
"I settled the lawsuit with no admission of guilt" is perhaps not quite the get-out-of-racist-jail phrase Donald thinks it is #debatenight
Our country will never be able to afford the pretenses that Donald Trump's affluence has afforded him. #debatenight #ItisAMERICA #NOTMERICA
At some point are we going to talk about actual issues??? #Debates
"You know what I did prepare for? Being president of the United States"  I AM SO HYPE RIGHT NOW I COULD DEADLIFT MY BODY WEIGHT #debatenight
It's conflicting when @realDonaldTrump says he's against something but makes the "ok" hand gesture. #debatenight #TinyHandProbs
This debate is like watching a teacher (whose patience is wearing thin) argue with an unruly student in the principal's office. #debatenight
Did he just tell her he knows what she thinks? I AM A BALL OF RAGE. #DebateNight #mansplaining
And now we've reached the "Trump talks down to the moderator while LYING" portion of the evening. #debatenight
Have you noticed Hillary hadn't taken a sip? This clone is killing Trump w/o getting thirtsy! #Debate #debatenight
#debates2016 you want to see a birth certificate, we want to see tax records 😱 Let’s Go Ya’ll!!!!!™
"I prepared to be President and that's a good thing" - Hillary Clinton ..boom! Go girl! #debates
He basically said he gettin over on WHOEVER and he don't give AF #debatenight
Paying no taxes doesn't make you smart, Mr. Trump. It makes you selfish. Thanks for supporting America. #debatenight
Trump acts and speaks the way we teach children not to. #debatenight
Are they going to ask about creepy clown in this debate? No? *switches channel* #Debates2016
If Trump's doing improv all night, he needs 3 other ppl to tag him out now and then. At least then this would be funny. #debatenight
Uhhh Hillary, your husbands signature brought about mandatory sentencing or am I mistaken? #Debates2016
Super classy to promote his new hotel at a presidential debate, BTW. Just like Lincoln would have wanted. #debatenight
Somewhere in Brussels, the Supreme Commander on NATO is yelling at the television. #debatenight
Not paying income tax might make you smart @realDonaldTrump, but that would make me a felon.. you asshole..#debates #Debates2016
#DonaldTrump: There are bad people out there, very bad people, terrible people. He may come up with "I thot I thaw a purry cat" #debatenight
Is it me or is Trump just being a GOAT like always.     #debatenight
His hand motions remind me of when Mariah Carey is hitting her whistle tones😂😂 #debatenight
I would bet money @realDonaldTrump doesn't know what first use policy is #debatenight #Debates2016
Trump has no international security knowledge.  We need specific details #ImWithHer #Debates2016
YES! I knew @realDonaldTrump would bring up Hillary's disgusting "Super Predators" comment  He is on his A Game. #debates #debatenight
Hillary is so incredibly ineffective, she's hoping Lester Holt will take her place #debatenight #Debates2016
"They say don't release tax returns till audit is over" "The IRS says you can release them" "Yep i can't release them"  #debatenight
Stop &amp; frisk - take the guns away from criminals. #Debates2016 #debatenight #debates #TrumpTrain   @realDonaldTrump @DanScavino
Trump is the reason NATO started dealing with terrorism. #Debates2016 #debatenight #debates #TrumpTrain   @realDonaldTrump @DanScavino
I was gonna watch the debates but hot tea and the princess bride sounded like the better option...
Nah. He's "our" President and yours too Trump! What a bum #debatenight
Hillary's incredulous laugh gasp might have been my favorite moment of this whole damned thing. #debates
This man literally just said he stiffed tons of works because he could..... #DebateNight
Prediction: That @HillaryClinton "Whew! Ok" shimmy just became the gif that broke the internet. #debatenight #Debates2016
If you didn't think Trump was ignorant before listen to his entire speech in which he uses Stop and Frisk as a positive example #debates
LAX == Guadalajara bus station in 1976, but not as pretty RT @TLCplMax: He's right LAX is like a third world country. #debatenight

I really miss @BernieSanders wish he was there as a third party during #debatenight I miss his fluffy hair and his no Nonsense arguments.
In talking about nuclear threats, did Donald Trump really just start with "we defend Japan?" Really? #debates
Our leader has great hair, the American candidates are either tumbleweed hair or coconut head with a swoop.  Canada: 1 America: 0 #debates
How did we get on trade deals when the question was about your tax return, Mr. Trump? #DebateNight #cbsnreax
let's not pretend "take the guns from the people" means legal owners. let's be honest. or nah. #debatenight
Yea @realDonaldTrump - who do you owe money to? What are you hiding? Let's see those tax returns. #debatenight
All in all. US politics, much like elsewhere is a complete and utter shambles. Goodnight #debatenight
SOOO WTF told @realDonaldTrump that he was the spokesperson for the African American community??? #debatenight
Ok Trump has made this entire debate about himself. #debatenight #Debates2016 A vote for trump is a vote for the end of american leadership
Trump started his entire political career on the racist lie that our first Black president was not a citizen - HRC #debatenight #Debates2016
Ah, time for Trumpski to talk about how cool the motherland is. #debatenight
What does the snorting mean? He wants to take advantage of the American people. Don't let him.#ImWithHer#Debates
White people only can talk about stuff they see on the news . Being n a minority's shoes is another story...#Debates2016
This #debatenight is to damn funny it's like two 5 years olds arguing #KANYEFORPRESIDENT2020
Trump shows leadership w/ outreach to black community while Hillary &amp; co. uses them as fuel for Dem vote machine. #mindset #Debates2016
If you've been audited every year of your life then he's never going to release them. #debatenight
#blathering trump We left Iraq too soon! ISIS is selling our oil!  #debatenight
I'm going to watch "Head of State" after this.  "God Bless America. And No Place Else" #debatenight
Clinton's reaction to Trump saying he has a good temperament lol. #debates
Race also determined if you got an apartment from Donald Trump's father #debates
Donald seems to think they need to be "put to heel" too. #debates
Why is that all I can think about is a @BadLipReading of this debate... Please make this happen! #debatenight
DT: No regs for my peeps,  but we must have law and order when dealing with *heavy sigh* African Americans #debatenight
It's true. Both candidates were pro-Iraq before they were against it. @JohnKerry shoulda waited to run! #debates
So, @realDonaldTrump supports sending troops into Syria? You heard it here first, America! #ImWithHer #Debates2016
@frangeladuo so if we fix the airports, they'll all have jobs making taco bowls #whatMoreDoTheyWant #debatenight
Is Hillary smiling enough for you people now? She can barely contain laughing at the crazy. #debates #debatenight
"What do you think of NATO?" "I loved sharkNATO!" - Trump, probably. #debates #debatenight #NoNeedToFactCheck
trump we really could careless about ur investments and how successful they are.. pls stop #Debates2016
Security aspect of cyber sounds like either an awesome band or a terrible tabletop setting. #debatenight
You know where only GOOD guys have guns? The fabulous Trump International Hotel. #debatenight
Oooohhhh boy so all African Americans walk out of their houses and just get shot. #trumplogic #debatenight
Who cares about #Trump's tax returns when #Hillary has deleted 30000+ emails that belong to the American public! #debates #debatenight
This whole election season is like a never ending SNL skit #Debates2016
"You've been badly treated," Donald Trump tells Black voters, after saying for years that the first Black POTUS was illegitimate. #Debates
"I have a much better temperament" than Hillary, Donald Trump says.  The audience laughs. THEY ACTUALLY LAUGHED  #Debates #DebateNight
Trump: we need Law and Order in our country...... It's a great show. It's the best show. I would know, I watch it every night. #debatenight
Bruh, building a club that people of all races party at does NOT repair the damage your rhetoric has done for race relations. #debatenight
Donald Trump's DNC hack suspects:  3. Russia 2. China 1. Fat Doug from Nashville  #debatenight
NATO members: jerks for not paying your share. People named Trump: smart not to pay your share. #debatenight
I take advantage of the laws - Donald J Drumpf - 2016 #debatenight #debates
#debatenight Real talk USA: THIS IS OUR BEST? 320M AND THESE TWO ARE OUR BEST?  We've become the joke of the world.
@HillaryClinton little advice for you in the future "People who live in glass houses shouldn't throw stones" #debatenight
@realDonaldTrump criticizes federal deficit that his tax plan will add $4 trillion to over 10 years. #debatenight
Praying that I wake up from this nightmare and @BernieSanders walks on stage saying we've been punkd right now #debates
This debate is a joke just like most people expected to be lmao #debates
really enjoying watching @SamSeder and @_michaelbrooks eat pizza nonstop during the debates #rivetingcommentary 👌🍕 #debatenight
Did he just admit to not paying taxes? "It would be squandered, too" --his response to accusation of not paying taxes #debatenight
I can't believe some of the stuff coming out of Trump's mouth #debatenight
"We have something in this country that need to be handled now" - @realDonaldTrump #GNEWSAPP #debatenight
The insane part of this is that Trump will win this debate based on his aggression &amp; Hillary will lose it because of her poise #debatenight
"Politicians are letting bad things happen to the inner cities" "Well I'm a politician so I blame the police." #debates #debatenight
If Hillary Clinton were the one sniffing it would be the biggest story in tomorrow's news about the debate.   #JustSayin   #debatenight
Hillary admitting that she made a mistake just won her the election. Standing next to a human(?) who is incapable of doing so. #debatenight
If "Baghdaddy" isn't the name of the most successful Middle Eastern #rapper of all time then I'm not sure which way is up. #debatenight
"I have a much better temperament."  The crowd vocally disagrees. #debatenight
When's the last time you landed in a third world country, Trump? #debatenight
~trump talking about committing a war crime, again (should've taken oil), in a Presidential Debate. no biggie. #DebateNight
Trump on paying no federal income tax - "That makes me smart." Hmm... I think that seems crooked. #debates
It's truly a good thing I had Jameson in the cabinet. #debatenight
Clinton apologizing &amp; taking responsibility for her mistake! Wow.  Public for 100+million to see/hear it.  #Debates2016
@JoelGodett lowering the bar? It's a fact. Career politician with several one on one debates versus an outsider. It makes things interesting
Damn it. I'm flying into LaGuardia this week. I thought I was going to New York, not the Third World.   #DebateNight  #USPresidentialDebate
Trump is losing ground. He's on a blind attack trying to reach something. Even it was his campain #Debates2016
Attacking Hillary for something she was a victim of. Way to go after the female vote Trump. #MonicasDress #Debates2016
Donald Trump stairing Hillary as he want to say 'You still sleep with Clinton in bed?' #debatenight #debates
Trump is pretty much saying "if you're rich and can pay for settlements, you can be racist." #debatenight #PresidentialDebate
#debatenight  "you can't just say law and order-" "special victims unit?"
Christ! Flinging crap now on this #debatenight  No substance to see here folks #NeverHillary #NeverTrump #JillNotHill #Debates #PresDebate
Thanks go out to the Washington Post for their investigative work on Trump's charities #debatenight
someone plz come to my place and stop me from face-swapping this entire debate  #Debates2016
NO DONALD - WE CANNOT TAKE THE OIL - FOR THE 200th TIME THAT IS A WAR CRIME PERIOD  #DebateNight #Debates
sniffling. tax evasion. bluster. is there a mercy rule for these debates? #debatenight
So @realDonaldTrump is that fed rate a threat from rich people to the middle class? #Debates #debatenight
Senator Clinton is speaking some solid sense on the race issue #debates #debates2016
@HillaryClinton: "if you're too dangerous to fly, you're too dangerous to own a gun." #DebateNight
"Computers are magic. You should be very afraid." - Trump (basically) #debates
@wikileaks I don't know but I do know that everyone else is losing #debates
Not releasing returns gives Hillary free reign to speculate on Trump #DebateNight
It's like Trump is vaguely remembering his one fact about gun violence in Chicago. Hundreds, no thousands, yes four thousands #debatenight
Who's Tara and why does Donald Trump want to stop her? #debates
Donald “Law &amp; Order” Trump honestly can I please abstain from this election #debatenight
"We're opening up Pennsylvania Ave right near the White House."  *GW students that live 4 blocks away from the WH groan* #debatenight
He has no idea how oil works... ..how exactly does one "Take all the Oil" Do we get US troops to suck it out with straws? #Debates
#Debates "I have something to say, I have a new endorsement." - DJT
#debatenight #pointTrump WHY NOT! @HillaryClinton has had a hand in everything for decades and its gone to crap. #HofDebate16 #Hannity
I don't think the audience is what Lester needs to worry about. #debatenight
Answering questions about not releasing your tax returns by not answering questions about not releasing your tax returns. #debatenight
If @realDonaldTrump treats his opponents and foreign dignitaries the way he debates @HillaryClinton, the US is fucked.  #Debates2016
Don't hate her; her policies &amp; attitude bad for every American @YuriyATL404 #debatenight #Debates2016
DID TRUMP 'my fingers aren't small' JUST CALL CLINTON OUT ON HER TEMPERAMENT?? #debatenight
Donald Trump must be a fucking oracle with all the things he's predicted for our government, economy etc. #debatenight #debates
#Debates"Law and Order"! Will same law applied in communities created out of segregation improve he situation. Isn't #Segregation the cause
"The gun epidemic is the leading cause of death of young African American men."  Not gonna please 2A nuts but need to be said. #debatenight
"The record shows that I'm right" - Trump . I'm not even sure what that means! #debatenight
why won't the orange murder man believe that racial profiling was found unconstitutional? my pupils are dilating #debatenight
#Trump says he made $694 Million in income.. nah, he don't need to be President - his money already runs the world! SMH #debatenight
"taxes" are always such a boogeyman. Good on HRC tying taxes to military, vets, schools - tools needed to make Am great again #debatenight
Blah blah blah...my dad this my dad that.  This election isn't about your dad, it's about removing corruption! #DebateNight
Police don't need reform, they need compliance when they give an order to stop or drop a weapon.  #DebateNight
Trump's main points: "I own property there."  "[] endorsed me." [insertattackonHillary]  No actual policy points. #debates #imwithher
I wouldn't mind if Cuba Gooding, Jr. ran on stage and screamed "Show me the audit!" at this point. #debatenight
A guy who says "believe me" as much as @realDonaldTrump is most certainly a liar. That's a tell. #debatenight
My one takeaway from this debate: why are they wearing the opposite colors of their parties? #debatenight
Now's as good as a time as any that we're in a twitter bubble - what matters is post-debate spin #Debates2016
Awesome to see these two white folks fight about who's the better friend of black folks. #Debates2016
The question was how to fix it. Both never gave a reason how to fix it. Typical. #debatenight #LetGaryDebate  #debates2016
"when they go low, we go high!" – @FLOTUS one of my favorite quotes! yes Hillary! #debates
"Stop and frisk was ruled unconstitutional." "Mmm, you're wrong."  I'm sorry, does this man have any idea of anything? #Debates2016
These two are NOT equally bad- stop saying it. One is business as usual and the other is a man where the truth is what HE believes #debates
If the candidates were Harry Potter characters, Trump = Felch and Hillary = Dolores Umbridge. #makeithappen #Debates2016
Why and how is the northern issue racist?! God save us from Hillary prez! #debatenight
How the hell can you answer a question you did not hear? #DebateNight
Our mental health system is one of many roots to the problems America is facing #debatenight
"Law &amp; Order" = Stop &amp; Frisk = Illegals &amp; Blacks #debatenight
That feel when you study all night for an exam and it ends up being a piece of cake #debatenight
it is the number one threat in the world, so lets talk about NKorea #WhereIsGary #Debates
How many times has trump said "tremendous" and "billions of billions" his whole campaign? #debatenight
We need Law and Order. WE NEED JACK MCCOY AND WE NEED HIM NOW MORE THAN EVER. #debatenight
Trump moves from roaming gangs of dangerous African Americans to roving gangs of dangerous immigrants like a Law &amp; Order candidate #debates
Oh you BIG MAD huh? 😂😂 RT @TomiLahren: Hillary is holier than thou. She's also a lying sack of crap. #debatenight
Clinton: "Implicit Bias is a problem for all of us." She's on point tonight! #debates
"We need to move on"  Lester Holt is all of us #debates
The way to avoid taxes in business is, for one, to keep manufacturing jobs overseas in China like Apple and him.#debates
"I think implicit bias is a problem for everyone, not just police."@HillaryClinton #preach #debatenight
I just want to know who hacked my Yahoo account and changed my password to "Rod5ucksDix." #Debates2016
"I have a much better temperament than her." She can't contain it any more. The comic relief. Love it. #ImWithHer #Debates2016
It's like he's just promoting his businesses and not answering the questions #debatenight #debates #Debates2016
Is trump arguing with himself about how much money he has/owes? #debatenight
Nevermind that the reason our infrastructure is so shitty rests on the shoulders of HIS party. #debatenight
I vote Lester for president. He's dealing with the two worst things in American history #debatenight #debates
Wow- he’s just lost the 400lb person sitting on their bed vote. #debatenight
#DebateNight stop and frisk is more like just stop all brown people
Ooo don't fall shame hackers trump! Just lost the fat vote! #debatenight
People already had their minds made up with who each candidate is. These debates don't matter no matter what they say
H - You pay no tax D - That makes me smart  Bloody hell! It's like fish in a barrel, shooting themselves. #DebateNight
"I got Obama to show his birth certificate and prove I was talking bullshit. Well done me" 😂 #DebateNight
I'm so stressed out about this! IT HURTS! I JUST HATE EVERYTHING! #debates
FOR THE LOVE OF GOD LESTER HOLT, LET THEM MAN BLOW HIS NOSE!!! #debatenight #sniffles
I can't take either seriously until Lester Holt asks the real question in this debate: is a hot dog a sandwich? #debatenight #teachthetruth
Dear Mr. Trump, I've never killed anyone and don't plan to. Believe it or not, I'm also black. #trump #debates #debatenight
You know you need a break from the US presidential #Debatenight? More nuclear fallout on @ABCClassic at midday with the history of Maralinga
It's funny that Clinton said that Trump has something to hide... :) #Debates
I'm thinking Carson Wentz may get a ton of write in votes in PA. #debatenight
#debatenight honestly I'm ashamed that we've let @realDonaldTrump become our GOP nominee. 😵
The court jester just made the crowd laugh @realDonaldTrump   The topic. Temperament. #Debates2016
Hillary's dad would be privileged to deal with a professional, successful businessman like Trump. Better than a two-faced daughter #debates
But seriously though...... can someone tell her about the lipstick on her teeth? #debatenight
So, what are you going to do about the race relations? Right now, I'm not hearing shit! #Debates2016
i know my boo @StephenAtHome is going to come through tonight with the post-debate jokes. #debatenight
I've had some lolz but I was hoping for proper meltdowns and a collapse @PwnySlaystation #debatenight #TheyreBothShit
Yes. Let's talk about Trump's businesses. AND goes back to the father thing. SHE IS BETTER AT THIS THAN YOU. #debatenight
Trump admits that he "hasn't given a lot of thought to NATO." Anyone else catch that? #debatenight
"His cavalier attitude toward nuclear weapons is Trump's most troubling aspect." #debates2016
"Sometimes there's not a direct transfer of business from business to politics" #debatenight #trumpeduptrickledown
HAHAHA THIS CANNOT BE REAL LIFE #Debates2016 we are so screwed 😂 Congress &amp; Supreme Court get ready for your checks &amp; balances
Let's add how many times Hilary mentions her father to the drinking games #Debates2016
Ooohh, #debatenight I should go log-on to my personal account. I follow a lot of fictional political accounts there, hahaha.
OOOOOOH I CANT WAIT TO HEAR THIS! D AND H ABOUT TO TALK ABOUT POLICE BRUTALITY SHOOTING BLACKS! #debatenight #Debates2016
"Trump has a long history of racism." SO DO YOU HILLARY STFU #debatenight
Somebody ask Hilary and Trump what they're going to do about eradicating CM Punk chants in 2016. #debatenight
'Believe me' was a trigger in my #debatenight drinking game - supper drunk nowe!:'
Huge props to Industrial Light &amp; Magic on their sentient movie puppet that broke free. #Debates2016
Imma act like my dad telling me how to play basket ball. "Hillary, square up and get in the paint!" #Debates2016
Straight for the amygdala. Trump understands that fear of "savages" is the root of white identity in America. #debatenight #Debates2016
I don't really know who's turn it is because Trump keeps interrupting lmao #debatenight
Sigh... can't watch #BlueJays or #debates  - both are depressing... 1 pitch one out... and then the gas can came out...
"Yeah, but you're a fucking lizard person" - Trump's retaliation receives standing ovation from crowd   #debatenight
#HillaryClinton is sounding oh so presidential. I'm tired of #DonaldTrump and all his tap dancing! #debatenight
"I prepared to be president. And I think that's a good thing." YASS KWEEN!!! #PresidentialDebate2016 #ImWithHer #NeverTrump #Debates2016
@realDonaldTrump keeps sniffing. Is he ok? Is this a body double? Are they replacing him? Is he dying? #debatenight  #Debates2016  #debates
"I take advantage of the laws".. this man is the most selfish motherfucker ever. Ignorant ass! #debatenight
Poor Sweet Lester. Not his Fault. You knew these two would probably ignore him #Debates
"I have property there." Donald Trump is that douche bag boss that invites you over for dinner and shows off his golf trophies. #DebateNight
The NRA...likely reconsidering their endorsement of Trump as they hear him talk about taking guns away from gang members! #debatenight
#LesterHolt how much is the #Clinton camp paying you?  When will you ask Hillary even one tough question? #MediaBias #debatenight
Look. Sometimes you accidentally systemically discriminate against blacks. Could happen to anyone. #debatenight
Uh oh - Trump mentioned gun control. Gun nuts hate that. Dude is off the rails! *sniff* #Debates2016
Interrupting repeatedly with "wrong" "wrong" "wrong" really makes him look presidential. #Debates2016
Trump pays no tax - response - "that makes me smart" because, I mean, screw the country #debates
gorram it, I can't anymore. I just can't. good night internet. #debates
Trumps love is directly related to whether or not he has investments there. Fact #debatenight
Someone please get a camera crew on my parents as they watch this debate. I'm demanding. #debatenight
Democrats got me to loathe the people who started the Iraq War and now they want me to vote for people who voted for it. #debates
Son just said he took a donald dump- it was the biggest, the best, anyone's ever taken #debates
Referring to @HillaryClinton @realDonaldTrump says: 'I have a winning temprament, she doesn't know how to win' #debates #debatenight
I opened a business and let black people give me their money. - Trump #debatenight
Good strategy: make him so mad that he just continues to seem unhinged and will try to punch the air. #debates #thisislikerockyiv
YOUR SWING STATE?! THE ENTIRE EFF IS GOING ON. HE WILL PUT YOU IN JAIL IF YOU STEAL FROM HIM BUT HE HAS NOT PAID A DIME IN TAXES. #debates
All this time and details that are connected to nothing. He's treading water right now bc he knows this is bad news. #debates
"We've become a third world country" this clown sounds like a teenage girl who just lost her wifi signal. #Debates2016
Hang on, is Donald trying to close another deal in Palm Beach? #Debates2016
A list of things I care more about than fancy airports: institutional racism, public education, healthcare, military spending. #debates2016
HRC: We need thoughtful solutions to terrorism; we should engage with NATO to do this. DJT: Terrah bad. Nato never pays mah bills. #debates
You don't even manage your own damn money. I'm sure you have many financial advisors. @realDonaldTrump #DebateNight
@realDonaldTrump you can't even own up to the horrible things you have said about Muslims. A horrible person. #Debates2016 #racist #liar
Stop and frisk is racist garbage that's why it was deemed unconstitutional #debatenight
What I've learned so far: maybe Donald Trump should do my taxes next year... #DebateNight
This debate is a prime example as to why @realDonaldTrump should never be allowed anywhere near the White House #debatenight
CLINTON: yeah i know you just said we're talking about race but GUNS #debatenight
Hillary's elitist attitude is intolerable. They think they're beyond questioning.  #debates
"The very nasty commercials you do on me," says the very very sensitive man baby. #debatenight
Lester Holt has officially lost control, welcome to how the rest of the country feels #debates #debatenight
Donald was that a totally gratuitous shot at overweight people?  Just thrown in for fun in cyber security answer? #DebateNight
#debatenight Police need to be better vetted. There needs to be training for mental health training, and deseculation. How about that folks?
#debatenight Stop and Frisk was deamed unconstitutional in a court. It was racial profiling.
Thanks for the name dropping, asshole. Why aren't we hearing about actual issues?  #Debates2016#fuckingnarcicist
I feel like both candidates are that kid in class who is trying to give a book report-but they clearly didn't read the book.#debatenight
Is Lester Holt still there? Wasn't this supposed to be two minutes each? #debates
When you get your news and sources from buzzfeed and cosmo @realDonaldTrump #debatenight
IF Trump was Rubio, ask yourself if you consider this a good debate performance. #dontlie #Debates #DebateNight #MSNBC
Hillary asked about race, says we need to "get communities together" (whatever that means), but also wants guns off the street. #debatenight
Trump makes sure to kiss the NRA's butt when talking about gun violence. #debatenight
The Hil shoulder shake that means I'm about to go in AND come correct. Here for it #Debates2016
"listen to what you just heard...the racist lie" history has its eyes on you #ImWithHer #debatenight
if i was hillary, it would be about now i would start reeling out every racist thing trump has ever said #debatenight
ok, well at least the moderator's bringing up birtherism if hillary won't #debatenight
The differences between Donald and Hillary are so stark. Trump is dog whistling and gaslighting. #debatenight
"I get intimidated by words like "cognizant," makes me feel dumb"   "Well, you could always use "bigly"" #husbandandwife  #debatenight
if you are experiencing this event sober, i am so sorry. #debatenight
Trump has spent half his time defending the dumb comments he's made throughout his moronic existence. Nice job, Hillary. #debatenight
Glad I'm not drinking every time he says Law and Order! #debates
@hillaryclinton sponsors ISIS. Why didn't she fight ISIS as secretary of state? Because they own her.  #Debates2016
Would you stop and frisk LeBron James? Would you stop and frisk LESTER HOLT!? #debatenight #ImWithHer
Moderator is admonishing the audience for not remaining silent, warns that they won't get ice cream before bed if they play up. #debatenight
Palm Beach, Florida is apparently the wealthiest community in the world. Interesting. #debatenight
I don't think he knows the difference between people laughing with him and laughing at him...but he seems VERY proud of both   #Debates
Ooooooo.  Trump diving in to emails looks mean.    #debates
Im totally loving Hillary’s evil genius smile right now.  She’s ready to pounce. #debatenight
At least Hillary has class and acts like an actual adult #debatenight
#debatenight This is hilarious! Where is Jill Stein! I'm being entertained! 😂😂😂
Hillary gonna slide in that he husband and her contributed to those jailed 👀 #debatenight
HRC's performance/strategy is like when Ali fought Foreman. She's just watching as he exhausts himself. #ropeadope #debatenight
HRC just essentially called Trump "twitter-fingers." Y'all this debate is over. #debatenight
She's honestly doing so much better than I had even hoped #debates
I was going to get a glass of water, but I can't. There's no running water in this third world country that is America.  #debatenight
"A judge who is a very against police judge." Almost a complete sentence there, I'm really impressed #Debates
Trump thinks that by cutting taxes the wealthy ceo's are gonna create more jobs instead of more offshore accounts. #debatenight #debate
We have to weed out the nonsense tweets and opinions on here, who really has something real to say about the debate? #debatenight
@HillaryClinton is too smart, and too qualified to share a stage with Trump. #debates  #debatenight #Debates2016
Did you catch it?! He basically admitted he pays no tax! #debatenight
I don't know how people can listen to Trumps answer to that last question and still say they want to vote for him 😐 #Debates
I did a great service for hte US by making someone show a piece of paper proving their loc of birth! Cause that's what we needed. #debates
HOW DOES HE EXPECT US TO JUST "TAKE" OIL!? OIL ISN'T PACKAGED WITH A BOW, EASY TO "TAKE." Oh my lawd. #debatenight
Steven Hayes was on no fly list he said it was a nightmare to get off @realDonaldTrump #debatenight
@KalaRamaTV @PIX11News @LesterHoltNBC @realDonaldTrump reality is more guns in ghettos. Just the way it is! # truth #debates
Wonder if killary  got a better ear piece ?  #debatenight #debates
If I had a buck for every time Trump said "you're wrong" so far tonight, I could refuse to release my taxes &amp; get a comb-over. #DebateNight
"I did really well, I have common sense!"  In you own words Mr. Trump; (as we've heard a million times tonight) You're wrong. #debatenight
#debatenight #Debates2016 his temperament is better than hers? WTF, is he really this delusional?
This is good popcorn television... But the world should be scared.  Trump is delusional. #debatenight
Sean Hannity's mom doesn't even want to talk to Sean Hannity #debatenight
H.Clinton: "You know what else I prepared for? I prepared for the presidency." _BOOM!_ #presidential_debate #debatenight #Debates2016
Word of the day ... “BRAGGADOCIOS” #debates I gotta be a little aggy during this debate. Lol
Started a drinking game:do a shot every time @LesterHoltNBC takes control of the #Debates2016. 70min in, can still legally drive
@RockyRo0 I hope they fact check Trump and Hillary's hairdos - nobody believes that's their real hair. #Debates
"The way that I say that is not in a braggadocious way." I'm LOLing to infinity at that one. #debatenight #imwithher #bigmouthtinyhands
Can anyone tell me what the debate is about sounds like a bar argument #debatenight
The largest police organization endorsing Trump is the scariest fucking thing ever tbh #debatenight
"I did a great job" getting Obama to produce birth certificate. Since when did Obama need to produce it in the first place? #Debates2016
How can anyone be attracted to a man who literally spends 3/4 of his defense bragging about himself? Are you sane? #debatenight
Can we get some stills on hillarys amazing smirks tonight please !? #debatenight 😂😂👏🏼👏🏼
Y'all ppl that talking about not voting better really sit and process your future actions #DebateNight
Of COURSE no one wants to call Sean Hannity. Sean Hannity doesn't want to call Sean Hannity. #debates
Donald Trump had the stupidest faces. He never knows how to display a poker face. #debatenight
At least she knows how to fake it though. Her temperament isn't so bad that she behaves like an 8 year old #debatenight
Hillary reading the hell out of Trump, calling him out for pandering to racists #debatenight #Debates2016
Taking shots when Trump says "Tara" but means "terror". Also, now Trump wants NATO to launch a military campaign? #debatenight #Debates2016
Every one should be respect by the law, and every one should respect the law: #clinton  #debates
Theory: #Trump sniffs every time he lies. Also, he is DYING to go to war with China. #Debates2016 #NeverTrump
You can't tell me Lester isn't going straight to the bar after this. #debatenight #debates
Note to myself: check how many jobs Mr. Trump created as a businessman #debatenight #debates
I think he’s shouting and acting so antsy because he’s getting zero reaction from the crowd.#debatenight
Questioning Hillary's temperament? "I have a winning temperament" literally as he talks over the moderator lol #debatenight #okay
This shit is a hoax, I have not seen Donald Tump write 1 damn note or rebuttal when she talks. #debatenight
Hilary, just say it. Mandatory sentencing has put away too many PEOPLE OF COLOR. Just say those three words, please. #debates
Answer the damn questions Donald and stop hiding behind your "investments" #debatenight
I'm watching the debates right now and when Donald Trump talked about defeating ISIS, I laughed so hard Red Bull came through my nose
Trump brags about not paying taxes then complains about the national debt #Debates
"I got him to prove I was spouting a load of horseshit for five years. I think I did a very good thing there!" #Debates2016
Okay.  Donald is happy that Obama released his birth certificate because we couldn’t fight ISIS until it was released?  #debatenight
Hillary:  Reminder, folks, Obama has not been president forever. We have had other presidents.  #debatenight
Well, if he is happy with the result, then he did do a good job. #Debates
#debatenight that Bernie thing was the only thing he's said all night that didn't sound like a garbage disposal to me
"We need to do cyber better" Trump loves to brag about his wealth but I bet he couldn't create a simple macro on excel #debatenight
Donald Trump speaking is basically the "below basic" rubric score for a standardized writing test #debates
Conspiracy theory! Hillary is Donald's less hot daughter that he TOTALLY hates but fits in the glass slipper better than Ivanka#debatenight
Trump is a real joke I really can't take him serious #debatenight
@HillaryClinton: "You know what else I prepared for? I prepared to be President?" Game. Over. #DebateNight
Trump just admitted to scamming people within the law . Lol. #debatenight
Trump's investments are more important to him than the lives of people. #blacklivesmatter #Debates
Trump is UNHINGED. Not in control. Not alpha. Not strong. This man represents toxic white masculinity in full. #debatenight #Debates2016
Here we go with the fucking emails.  THAT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH THE DAMN TAX RETURNS.  People are really voting for this fool?  #debates
tbh i feel my chakras misaligning just listening to #debatenight where the sage at
"When they go low, we go high" Take the high road! @FLOTUS #debatenight
"He's willing to say it, but nobody wants to call him!" Call my friend! He'll back me up!! Call him up now! #debatenight
“We need Stop and Frisk.” &lt;— That’s your nominee, y’all.  #debatenight
Moans. Sniffles. Sighs. All from Trump. Remember when Gore's sighs killed him? #debatenight
Did Trump kinda blame Obama for being in Iraq in the first place? #debatenight
Trump giving his Tony Soprano foreign policy plan -- NATO needs to pay protection money.  #debatenight
Not sure how @HillaryClinton isn't laughing her ass off with this clown!! #DebateNight #Hilary2016 #ImWithHer
Ok. New rule. Moderator gets to shut off microphone of person not to be talking. #debatenight
Will someone please keep Trump under control? He can't keep his mouth shut #debatenight
What the heck does law and order have to do with anything. This is about racism. #Debates
So basically, this whole #debates is nothing more than he did, she did .. nothing new #EpicFail
Once Donald is asked to stop or relax, he raises his voice or says "Listen". I'd hate to have this man "lead" me in anything. #Debates2016
#debatenight let's hope @realDonaldTrump's brain was microchipped so animal control can return it when it gets picked up
Debates are pretty meaningless, both candidates have been studying for weeks on how to answer the toughest questions
She really wants to roll her eyes so badly. But she needs to stop looking at him.#Debates2016
#debatenight Blowing up Iranian boats won't start a war? Are you kidding me Trump?   Lord help the US.
#debatenight #DonaldTrump BWAH.....  YOUR TEMPERAMENT?! #HillaryClinton holds herself w/dignity and respect in this debate &amp; holding strong
We were talking about police brutality and somehow this became about gun control #debates
He has just ended the whole campaign. And Hillary's silent smile is her best shot tonight. She just won. #debatenight
#debatenight Answer the damn question Donald! I'm tired of you diverting from the issue!
I hate both candidates but I would prefer Hillary as our next president over that old, racist, incestuous, sack of bullshit. #debatenight
Hillary can't even write a successful book and she wants to be President... #debatenight
The fact I have to put up with hearing one of these clowns speak for 4 years in a position of power is painful 😩🔫 #debates
Trump is being ridiculous. The IRS already has his returns. Releasing them does nothing. #debatenight
Comedy night with @realDonaldTrump: "I got Obama to produce his birth certificate. I think I did a good job." Oh, boy. #debatenight
DONALD WAS BLOWING COCAIYEENA BEFORE THE DEBATES. HE KEEP SNIFFLIN' 😂😂😭😭
Doesn't Trump understand that our investment in NATO is an investment in our own security? #debatenight
Why are Trump and Hilary wearing the opposing parties colors ? Trump is in blue and Hilary in Red. #debatenight
"Who was a very against police judge.." -Trump   WHAT AM I WATCHING, LORD PLS. #debatenight
Hillary: "He hasn't paid any income tax" Trump: "That makes me smart." Wow, this guy just bragged about not paying any taxes. #debatenight
He said he has a better temperament and the masses laughed... Dude... What are you smoking #debatenight
Stop &amp; frisk is the extent of DJTs knowledge of crime policy #debates
Debbie Wasserman Schulz and that unknown 400 lb man are the cybersecurity problems? #debates
Wildest party of the night probably being hosted by Putin rn. Rough night for America. #debatenight 🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸
Trump will release his tax returns after he is elected. NEVER. #debatenight
If more than 6 black people live in Palm Beach Florida I'd be surprised. #debates #debates2016
Trump is great at stating the obvious but never gets to a solution.  #debatenight
If you had a drink for every time he said endorse you would have alcohol poisoning by now.. #debatenight #debates #Debates2016
I'm not watching the debate for my own sanity but honestly how on earth did we get ourselves into this situation.  #debatenight
Only Hilary has a manifesto, Donald Trump is busy trying to give low blows to Clinton. #DebateNight
Trump: "They don't pay us what they should be paying us"  Also Trump: "I don't pay the people I hire and I'm proud of that" #debatenight
Why does he cuss so much?? This is not a reality tv show.. How are you gonna run the county and you are not humble. #debates
Tonight is literally White man talking over a woman and Black man over and over again. #debates
Hannity, Howard Stern, and Cavuto have become the real arbiters of truth, says @realDonaldTrump. Don't forget @AnnCoulter! #debatenight
#debatenight omg a @HowardStern mention by @realDonaldTrump ahahahaha this is the best debate ever 🍿😂🍿😂🍿😂🍿😂🍿😂
donald trump is mentally ill and unstable..  his temperment? insane.  He should be commited not voted for #debatenight
First of all I.C.E. Endorsing you is not impressive they ain't shit either if you know the truth about this world foh Trump #debatenight
Trump keeps bringing up stopandfrisk, which has been deemed unconstitutional. He's all for it as long as we're stopping brown ppl.#debates
if Trump interrupts Hillary one more time. I'll snatch his toupee #debatenight
WE ALL HEARD HIM SAY "I WAS JUST ENDORSED BY ISIS" #debatenight
This debate seems more like a “pointing finger blame game” than an actual debate about the worlds problems.. #debatenight
Trump wants to take the guns away from the "African Americans" sniff sniff #debatenight
Okay so Trump just said we need to take guns from bad people, but according to him only minorities are bad ppl #debatenight
He has been defending Stop and Frisk for 5 solid minutes. #Debates2016
So you want to bring law and order back-then what're you going to do to help end police brutality? 👀🐸☕️ #debatenight
he wouldn't know "good temperament" if it hit him in the face, are you kidding me #debates
Can we disqualify both of these 2 and pick 2 others, OUR CHOICE? #debatenight
#Debates2016 somewhere Bill and his girlfriend are watching the debate eating cracklins drinking light beer. No they switched to porn.
#Debates2016 listen y'all ol mr trump is pooping on gun rights. He wants lists &amp; guns taken away from "people that use em" wtf??
Settling a lawsuit without admission of guilt doesn't mean it didn't happen #debatenight
Hillary is full of shit but Trump is so thick it's making her look good. USA are screwed whoever wins hahahaha #debates
Mao would be proud of @HillaryClinton and her little red commie outfit #debatenight
People still shocked by #DonaldTrump statement that not paying taxes makes him "smart" 😳😳😳 #Debates2016 #Decision2016
@realDonaldTrump on birthism is the worst yet &amp; profoundly disgusting 2 suggest he helped @POTUS by pushing the racist lie. #debatenight
If you want to see Trump's handy work when he claims he can turn an area around, by all means, just go to Atlantic City. #debatenight
I've recently been to all 4 US airports he mentioned &amp; all are pretty nice now. Less so maybe 8 years ago. Whoops! #DebateNight
fun drinking game: take a shot every time trump gives himself credit for something #Debates2016
Audience can react to Hillary but when they do to trump Holt admonishes them??? #debatenight
You can pay some of that dept off with your small loan of a million dollars. #debatenight
@Sohinki i got a game for you; take a shot every time trump says something stupid. you'll be dead in 30 seconds. #debatenight
"Braggadocious"  means I have to drink my entire beer cellar tonight, yes? #DebateNight
A strong, eloquent enunciation of a host of issues related to race and crime. #debatenight
Wait wait wait --- the answer is stop and frisk? Isn't that the definition of white privilege?! #Debates2016
We have to accept and change the systemic racism in our prison systems- Clinton #Debates2016 #debatenight
Trump says "terror" like Scarlett O'Hara talking about her plantation.  #Debates2016
@realDonaldTrump is simply laughable. I'm waiting for the joke to be over. #debatenight #Debates2016
"Clinton: It was my mistake using a private email server." Trump: "That's for sure." lol #PresidentialDebate #debatenight #GameChangers
Between a 400 lb man and his 10 yr old son, I'm not sure exactly what Trump's stance on cyber security is. #debates
#debatenight Lester Holt: "How would you stem the flow of cocaine to America, Mr. Trump?"   @realDonaldTrump : "Are you fucking nuts?"
just because u have companies in a country doesn't mean u are emotionally invested in the area, only economically #debatenight
I'm going to say something very scary... #Trump doesn't look absolutely shit right now #debatenight
#debatenight why would we trust you, Hillary, with any codes when you can't control your own phone or emails #ImNotWithHer
Does he really think that all blacks and Hispanics live in these places? #debatenight
Gonna go through #debatenight and reply to everyone in favor of the turd sandwich and call them a fucking idiot
Fun game: hold your hand up to cover the half of the screen your nominee is in. Imagine a different nominee there, winning. #debatenight
Do you guys think Nelly is still shouting out to Donald Trump when he preforms Country Grammar? #Debates2016 #debatenight
"We pay too much for our military. I know a guy in Chinatown who can get us tanks and bombs for like half the price." - Trump #debatenight
In my opinion debate is equal so far. Trump is starting to ramble.. Probably won't cause much of a swing in the polls #debatenight
This one is going the full 90, not 3 rounds like Hearns v Hagler #debatenight
"Trickle down has NEVER worked." -HRC  BOOM. Bingo. Amen. Yes, yes, and yes!  #debatenight
"mexicans are stealing our jobs" trump says the same generic shit every time. i don't see any original ideas, hillary meanwhile #debates
In case you've ever wondered what a toddler with narcissistic personality disorder looks like, I present to you #debates
With all that's facing this Country and the world, they're going on about the Presidents birth certificate. Switch off. #debatenight
"I love black people. I have the best black people." Better be the first thing he says.  #Debates2016
Absolutely wrong, he made comments regarding potential support in 2002 when it had 70%+ public support. #debatenight
Too busy slamming and not enough time laying out plans. It's like a spat in the playground.  #Debates2016
Trump has said nothing about terrorist attacks in America by Americans which was the question #Debates
Trump got everybody nodding with the "Laguardia is terrible" comment. I mean, it's true. #debates
"...when I was an infant..." Dude. You're pretty much the same age as her. With that toupee you ain't younger than 45. #Debates2016 #
My Black ass IS NOT living in hell. Thank you 3 headed monster! I stand with fire wolf on this one ✊🏿#DebateNight
Saying "Wrong" doesn't change the facts, as much as you "feel" like it does #debatenight
Have #wweraw and #debates on at same time, couldn't tell which audience was about to break into a "this is awesome" chant
TIL "Yeah I dunno maybe" is the same as "Yes, I do" #debates
Carries on racist birther lie for almost a decade, wants us to forget it in 30 seconds. Attention span of a toddler. #debatenight
PS Guys - ISIS has been around for over 40 Years! #WhoKnew #Debates #FuckingOrangePopsicle
''If you've ever said this: I like Trump because he's a straight talker! You're as dumb as shit.'' Jim Jefferies #debatenight
So obvious that Trump speaks from the heart. I trust that. Hillary is so rehearsed &amp; can't think on her own. Can't trust her. #debatenight
Race relations -- maybe this is a topic Clinton can own on, because shes been getting owned the last 45 minutes #debatenight
"I have a son. He is ten. He is very very good with computers. Cyber is a problem. Cyber cyber cyber cyber.." Dude, what? #debatenight
Donald trump: "typical politicians.."  *proceeds to say everything that describes himself*  #Debates2016
DEAR LORD PLEASE HAVE MERCY! END THE TORTURE AND SHUT THEM UP! #Debates2016 #rednationrising @andrewklavan #PJNET #HillaryForPrison
How is Obama's birth certificate even a topic in this debate? This is dumb people, move on! #debatenight #debate2016
What I will say is Hillary Clinton is really going at this debate with grace.   #Debates2016
omg why don't I watch more #debates ? this is HQ entertainment
Donald. You don't have to debate Lester. That's not how this works. #debatenight
I'm going to Make America Great Again &amp; Make Tremendous Jobs Again &amp; It Wiill be Beautiful Again. Unlike Hillary  #DebateNight
You make nasty commercials about me. But I'm nice to women, Mexicans, Muslims and .. I'm successful. So tremendous #DebateNight
BLACK MEN DOING THE SAME THINGS AS WHITE MEN ARE MORE LIKELY TO B SHOT! #debatenight
Donald Trump surely started off his campaign as a joke. He clearly never knew he was coming this far.  #Debates2016
Damn Russia.  Yall on that type of stuff now?  #debatenight
He got all his talking points from internet trolls. Oh, right...they're running his campaign #Debates2016
This #debate has been @realDonaldTrump &amp; @HillaryClinton whining about what the other posted about them on #Twitter. #debatenight
I broke my promise to myself...I can't watch this without alcohol. #debatenight #nevertrump
@dorisssmantley you do agree we are watching the heralding of the apocalypse , yeah? #debatenight
Trump can't answer the 'racial divide' question. He is pushing Authoritarian dictatorship. .  #Debates2016
Hillary strikes deep. Trumps racism oozes all over the stage.  #Debates2016
My prediction:  HRC wins the election rather handily. Trump ends up not with a new tv show, but an entire channel. #Debates
I'm still on that small loan...how is 14 million dollars....a SMALL LOAN ??? #debatenight
When black and hispanic people make up 59% of the prison population you can't argue against systemic racism. #debatenight
Clinton: No one should disagree about respecting the rights of young men who live in those neighborhoods... #debatenight @wdet
"We have to bring back law &amp; order" finally something I agree with! That was a great show! Would ice-tea be down? #debatenight
I can't stand how smug she is...  she's debating an idiot.  she doesn't have to be so fucking smug.   #Debates
Hillary is talking about HIDING something the American people have a right to see? #ClintonCash #ClintonsMemory #debatenight
"That makes me smart" should be as damning as the Nixon tapes. Fuck outta here, Cheeto #debatenight
Shill Barack Obama and his democrat cronies caused the racial tension. #Debates2016 #DebateNight
So you can defeat ISIS, but you can't defeat this nasal drip? #debatenight
#DebateNight Before you get to the criminal justice system, race affects how we are dealt with in our day-to-day lives.
#Debates Trump is a terrible person , what has this world come to
Trump keeps interrupting Hillary. I hate that. She keeps on fighting though. My champion @HillaryforCA @HFA #Debates2016 #ImWithHer
.@realDonaldTrump agrees with @HillaryClinton that in many places there needs to be better community-police relations #Debates2016
.@realDonaldTrump says he was totally against the war in Iraq. Repeatedly says to ask @seanhannity #Debates2016
Someone please fact check white men getting a more fair trail then white men. #debatenight
Stop and Frisk - bro that put so many of my homies in prison for no reason - you know NOTHING! #Debates2016 #debatenight
YES LESTER ASK HIM ABOUT BEING A BIRTHER FORCE HIM TO ADMIT HIS RACISM #USPresidentialDebate #Debates2016
I'm not drinking for a while so instead of alcohol, aspartame is my drug of choice. @DietCoke will always make me feel better. #debates
I said I wasn't going to tweet about the debate night... but I just did 😏 #debatenight
I like cyber. I've got a huge cyber. I'm the best cyber. We did the cyber #Debates
Clinton came up w/ the Birther movement. Trump ran with it for political opportunities. Both are incredibly racist candidates. #debatenight
She said she the word "law", @realDonaldTrump She also said respect. Stop and frisk is the opposite of respect, of trust. #debatenight
Anyone else watching Donald trump's beck belly dancing on tv rn?? #debatenight
"African Americans are 62 quadrillion times more likely to eat shellfish." -- Trump pulls whatever random "facts" in his head.  #debatenight
"a very against police judge"  my nine year old has a better vocabulary than this whackamole #debates  I'd pay to see that debate
Trump just rambles and makes no sense jumping from one thing to another #debates
The moderator needs to regain control otherwise it will devolve into a mud-throwing bonanza... #debatenight
I have a lot of respect for @HillaryClinton How has this woman not rolled her eyes once?! That is one strong female! #debatenight
I procrastinate my homework at the same level Trump procrastinates answering the actual question #Debates
Jill is trying to do her own debates and I mean it's interesting and admirable but like you're standing behind a green screen wtf lol
NOW THT I UNDERSTAND ECONOMY BETTER TRUMP MAKES ME SO FUCKIN ANGRY #debatenight USELESSCUNT
I can't watch this no more I am going to bed #Debates
We must respect the lives of young African American and Latino men, especially in their own communities. #DebateNight #NYDebate
Am I crazy, or does Trump talk for two minutes and somehow give no information? #DebateNight
#DebateNight  I know politics bore you But I feel like a hypocrite talking to you And your racist friend
#Debates2016 It's like watching my neighbor yell at kids to get off his lawn.
Trump continues to get the yells and applause. When Hillary talks...crickets.  #debates
His only perspective on the economy is jobs leaving the country, regulations, and lower taxes. Specifics? #DebateNight
I get not citing qualitative data in debates, but citing quantitative data should be mandatory. #debatenight
.@yinzersosmart fuck the fucking NRA.  Some people should not own guns. Period. #DebateNight
I thought SNL was an NBC show. How come it's on every network right now? #debatenight
someone needs to write that trump answer down as beat poetry.  typical politician talks a lot never gonna happen  #debates
Cmon! There are REAL problems in the world. When are we hearing ISIS? Healthcare? Immigration? The earth MELTING?! #debatenight
If all of us watching, tweeting, lamenting debates spent the last 90 minutes volunteering...WOW. What impact we could have had #Debates2016
Why do they let him keep rambling? Fuck the Donald  #Debates
So, who did Lester tick off to have to do this job? #debatenight
Who was a very against police judge. He's so good with words! #Debates2016
I'm old and don't hear so well... Did he say he's endorsed by ISIS? The first endorsement ever? #debatenight
That was the best email answer she's given. But we won't move on from it, I'm sure. #Debates2016
I think I know what he's trying to say, but he doesn't seem to be stringing words into sentences. #Debates2016
We are and hour and 7 minutes in and I don't believe Trump mentioned the wall. #Debates2016
The single greatest danger to America is mass immigration from the third world. #debatenight #ImmigrationMoratorium
Donald Trump sure is drinking a lot of water. And I mean, a lot of water. #debatenight
Drink everytime trump sniffles &amp;'you'll be on the floor in 20 minutes #Debates2016
I have the feeling that Hillary is trying her best not to laugh out loud. #debatenight
Trump.  You will NEVER be a positive rep for African Americans.  N.E,V.E.R. #debates
It's easy to settle with no admission of guilt if you pay to do so #debates
Hmmmm a 400lb bed sitter did it.  That wasn't derogatory #debates
#debatenight this is a farce neither has much to say on improving domestic policy next time invite @DrJillStein
Question: What time is it? Trump: I know you are, but what am I" #debates2016
Clinton: We need more second-chance programs. End private prisons. There are positive ways we can work on this. #debatenight
"I have a much better temperament than her" *audience laughs* There ya go. #debatenight
It's not hard to bring a project under budget and ahead of schedule. That's basic CM 101 #Debates2016
"I have a much better temperament than she does." QUICK! Someone get the fact checkers on that. #debates
"We have to knock the hell out of ISIS and we've got to do it fast." -DT #debates
Now he is just yelling out "wrong"??   Sir.   #Debates2016
Donald is sniffing in his LIES like Noo Noo sucks up Tubby Custard! #debatenight #Teletubbies
#trump is really good at restating what everyone already knows - AND reminding us he owns property there. #debates
#debates - I am desperately hoping #trump says "liar, liar, pants are on fire!" Before this night is over......
When I'm president, there will be more ice cream trucks, cheaper books, and fewer clowns. And more shade in football stadiums. #debatenight
"your president things?" seriously? can someone tell this guy to use proper language!! #debatenight
#Debates2016 Trump go blow your nose or quit snorting before you hit he stage!!!
I'll bet Howard Stern just threw his phone in the trash.  #debatenight
Contrary 2 what @HillaryClinton &amp; @realDonaldTrump think, #racism &amp; community policing aren't mutually exclusive. #2016election #debatenight
"A man who can be provoked by a tweet shouldn't have his fingers on the nuclear codes..." #sheslays #ImWithHer #debatenight
Trump is not afraid to tell it like it is...Hillary likes to sugarcoat shit. #Debates2016
He only cares about a place if he has a property (financial interest) there? The fuck? #debates
Is this really a presidential debate? WTF? He said. She said. #imwithher #Debates2016 #debates
So far, this debate looks like a draw, although Trump looks a little over-eager. #debates #debatenight #Debates2016
"U walk down the street you get shot!" Fear mongering and no plan on how to fix anything. Not to mention offensive it is. #Debates2016
Of the 1624 people I follow, only 2 appear to openly support Trump, @piersmorgan and @RealJamesWoods #DebateNight #ImWithHer
I haven't even figured out what Trump is saying . At All . #likeachild #debatenight #debates2016 #2016debates
I'm not sure what this guy is talking about. Why would I vote for this guy? Oh it's because the other one is Hillary. #Debates2016
Omg it's a miracle trump actual waited for Clinton to finish speaking before responding #debatenight
Someone tell trump that us Hispanics &amp; Black people don't like Law and order🙋 #debatenight
I figured out why @realDonaldTrump is sniffing his way through #debatenight he's allergic to the truth.
"Hillary pays for attacking ads and I don't"- the man who paid for a snapchat filter that said "crooked Hillary" #debatenight #apgovlove
#vcusmclass #debatenight Trump says he will release tax returns after he's audited by the IRS.
#vcusmclass #debatenight Do you feel the Debate monitor is doing an efficient job keeping control of the debate?
Hillary taking the high road &amp; getting back to serious issue of NATO.  Letting Donald make a fool of himself. #DebateNight
There is more sniffing coming from @realDonaldTrump than a 1980s porn den in Simi Valley. #Debates2016
Not paying Federal income tax makes you "smart" according to @realDonaldTrump. I guess we poor people are stupid. #debatenight #ImWithHer
#debatenight Mod: that was ruled unconstitutional. Trump: nah, you're wrong. Ok, douchebag. Sure.
Trump: Emails! Hillary: Tax returns!! Lester: I want to go home now plz. #debatenight
this guy is worse than the children i nanny. you need a time out, Mr. Trump. #debate #debates2016  #debatenight  #ImWithHer
George W. Bush invaded and occupied, Iraq. Why is Donald such an idiot? #debatenight
Donald looks confused.  He doesn't know the definition of the word "coalition."  #debatenight
Trump was SUED in the 70s since he would mark any african-american person's application with a "C" for colored. disgusting #debates2016
YOU'RE NOT EVEN MAKING AN ARGUMENT AND YOU JUST BLAMED OBAMA FOR MURDER IN CHICAGO, WHAT EVEN ARE YOU DOING?! #debatenight
This #debates won't change anyone's mind. So I'm going to relax, drink a beer, and watch #MNF instead. #realism #footballisbetter
Can Trump answer ONE question that doesn't end with him talking about himself and him patting himself on the back? #debatenight
He's also advocating stealing the only resource Iraq has to keep itself together. That's illegal. #debatenight
The Iran deal saved a ground war and nuclear war between Iran and Israel w/i a decade. #DebateNight
Trump thinks America is a loser. How can someone expect to be President if his campaign slogan is insulting the country? #debatenight
China should solve the NK problem.   They won't because it's a buffer state   WELCOME TO INT'L DIPLOMACY #debates
Y'all, I love Lester Holt. Someone buy him all the drinks after this #debatenight
@Tomyboiz @shyna_r Pretty awful for your own petty submissions too..FACTS CHECK shows @realDonaldTrump has really FUMBLED.. #debatenight
#TrumpVsClinton matchup looks like #Kasparov vs #karpov  #Hillary is waiting for #trump to commit a mistake.  #debatenight
Not renting to black Americans, was ok because everyone else was doing it #WTF #debatenight #Fightnight
"I'll release my returns when she releases her 33,000 deleted emails" TRUMP TRUMP TRUMP #debatenight
I think he has lied as much as he has sniffed #debatenight
hillary: facts trump: actually you may be right but I strongly believe you're wrong  #debatenight
We went from 1,000 gun-related deaths in Chicago to 3,000 since January 1st according to Trump. #debatenight
I think it's really weird that their spending as much time as they are by talking about obama's birth certificate #debates
All Isis would need to do to beat Clinton in cyberwar fare is to send her pictures of frogs #debates #Clinton #Isis
"A little behind schedule" -- @LesterHoltNBC is the only one who knows the power of an understatement.  #Debates2016
Plutocrats hoarding money: not an economy.  Many participants actively exchanging goods and services: economy. #debatenight #fundamentals
I certainly wouldn't have the discipline to stifle my laughter, let alone give a coherent, thorough, detailed response. #debates
@realDonaldTrump drop your advisors. Recruit supporters not on payroll. Then you will win debates. Regroup -change your approach.
Donald is continuing to show his thin skin and how easy it is to have him shout and continually interupr #Debates
"It doesn't work that way."  -Donald Trump, who was once a Democrat.  #debatenight
Yay! It's trumped up "tickled" down time again. Whose gonna win the tickle war? #debates
Trump is not in good control. He's used the word 'thousands' too much. #DebateNight
Hillary looking at the camera like "my ears are getting cancer"   #debatenight
Did my dog fart or is the stink from the tv? #Debates
Of course #HillaryClinton didn't treat #Obama well in 2008...SHE WAS TRYING TO WIN THE WHITE HOUSE! #Understandable #debatenight
Ah. We're talking Russia now.   Putin would eat the Talking Orange Cheetoh for breakfast.  #debatenight
Trump loophole is valid... Trumped up trickle down economics no thank you #debatenight
#debatenight please please please god let @HillaryClinton say, "I just can't talk to you when you're this emotional, Donald." Amen.
#debatenight lol @ obviously morbidly obese @realDonaldTrump talking shit abt "400lb" hacker "sitting on the bed." #projecting much, asshat?
Yelling and talking out of turn doesn't make you right dude uh, temperament? #outclassed #debatenight
#debatenight trump claims that he's never shown discrimination towards black, hispanic or muslim people... sure jan
@jsnshep shows how entrenched our nation is in this broken system when we can't have 3rd party independents in the debates
#Trump bashes Hillary on deleted emails, #Hillary bashes Trump on not releasing tax returns! #debatenight #TrumpVsClinton
#Debates @realDonaldTrump is talking policy and winning. @HillaryClinton is doing personal attacks. Its reverse land.
I admire Hillary's restraint in not overreacting to this crazy shit. #debatenight
"A man who can be provoked by a tweet should not have his hands anywhere near the nuclear codes". #DebateNight Let @HillaryClinton!
Not all Hispanics are living in hell @realDonaldTrump. Learn how the majority live. Idiot. #debates
Trump just called out HRC: you've been at this for 30 years. Why are you just thinking about this NOW?  She turned RED.  Boom. #debatenight
Stop &amp; Frisk was not "ineffective," HillaryClinton. Stop &amp; Frisk was stopped bec those targeted were largely Afr Am &amp; Hispanic #debatenight
Donald Trump is basically saying he's the POS that everyone of his supporters are complaining about!  Too bad they don't get it. #debates
Alright Hillary. Stop and frisk is what Donald said. And what info can the Muslim community give us? #Debates2016
Wow, Trump just made a huge mistake on Terrorist Watch Lists. #debatenight
Very proud that Clinton said everyone needs to always question their feelings as she referred to implicit bias. #debatenight
One of the few times I can share a look w/ #HRC, that #sideeye when #Trump denies racial profiling in #StopAndFrisk #debates #RacialJustice
Correct, we should have a profit motivated prison system to put away politicians like you Hillary.  #debatenight
Clinton has an actual record with Muslim nations. It's really, really bad. She still knows Holt won't push back. #debatenight
The screen is cropped but when Clinton said "profit from prisons" I swear I saw a lightbulb lit up above trumps head #debatenight
Trump: "I haven't given much thought to NATO"....I don't think that's the only thing you haven given much thought to tbh #Debates2016
I'm not even watching #DebateNight #Debates2016 , but Twitter commentary is amazing. Thank you, folks.  #HillaryVsTrump #PresidentialDebate
5 minutes into the debate: "wow they're actually being somewhat civil." 30 seconds later: "...just kidding, spoke too soon." #debatenight
y'all.. I know we're laughing at the pure fuckery of all this.. but please.. please register to vote. it's in our hands. #debatenight
"Look at the hacks leading our country now" LITERALLY NOTHING BUT SHADE IN THIS DEBATE #debatenight
"I have a much better temperament than she does" SERIOUSLY, HOW IS THIS NOT SATIRE #debatenight
Clinton: "Actually, I've been thinking a lot about that..." Trump: "Yeah, for 30 years."  😂😂😂  #debatenight
He's lost this debate... Congratulations... The bitch from hell will be the POTUS ... Beam me up Scotty#Debates2016
Liberal American twitter should remember it is mostly tweeting to itself. #debatenight
I'm guessing Trump just lost the vote of all 400 pound voters... #Debate2016 #PresidentialDebate #Debates2016
That was a softball over home plate. Hit for the Green Monster on his temperament, Hilz. #debatenight
#debatenight  #trump #selfproclaimed idiot,  he needs to be admitted to asylum- as soon as possible #somebodytakehimout #wakeupamerica
I'm ready for this to be over because his voice is annoying!  #debatenight
#debates Guess what, those buildings may have your name on them, but they are NOT yours
#debates why is Hillary keep asking for bailout from the liberal fact checkers?  "Go to my website because I don't recall"
you guys, this guy is being seriously considered to run the whole show. this guy. this is real. #Debates2016
Trump's law &amp; order focus vs. Hillary's careful tiptoeing around race relations.  Trump wins this point HUGE #Debates2016
@DebateNight This is the funniest damned debate I have ever seen... Tragic for USA, but funny for the rest of the world nevertheless
Trump is being a disrespectful motherfucker. He keeps interrupting, chill the fuck down man. #Debates
DT looking &amp; sounding more in control. He is scoring points by pounding HRC. Holt not asking specifics fr DT or HRC. AWFUL. #debates2016
Please someone pass Lester a note,you're the moderator not part of the audience TAKE CONTROL !!!#Debates2016
retrain those racist cops not to ever arrest an oppressed black man. Prison is slavery! #debatenight
this is like watching #pac12refs trying to stop a fight from breaking out. #debates
Trump has insulted mentally disabled people ,minorities ,Fat people  &amp; just anyone that isn't a Wealthy white male or females . #debatenight
This would be good if it wasn't a verbal slapping match. Hillary, talk about what's important &amp; ignore him... #debatenight #debate2016
Is Hillary smiling enough for y'all tonight? Cuz she's catching all of Trump's jokes. #debatenight
It's getting rowdy in this bar. All of us polisci nerds are drinking and watching #debatenight
#debates Global warming is a problem, but a nuclear apocalypse is a MUCH bigger one.
Apparently Trump isn't aware that NATO has been fighting al Qaeda and the Taliban in Afghanistan since 2001 #debatenight
Trumps personality is just so incredibly fucking funny. I can't take either of these fools  #debates
njdotcom: Donald Trump blames Hillary Clinton and POTUS for the formation of ISIS #debatenight #debates
Trump defends stop and frisk...and then goes on to say that politicians have failed African Americans? #confused #debates #debatenight
So is @realDonaldTrump saying we all just need to relax and go watch Law and Order? Finally something I can get behind #debatenight
Is it @HillaryClinton 's job to lie to the American people on live t.v.? #debatenight #TrumpTrain #trump2016
Trump is talking about money coming back but TBH I don't think a single person can follow this word salad. Anyway, populismism #debates
The only reason why I'm watching the #debatenight is bc is my government homework
"I prepared to be president - and that's a good thing." #ImWithHer #HillYes #debatenight
How is your being endorsed by whoever doing any good for the people of this country, Trump? No one cares! #DebateNight
THE TRUMP AUTON ALSO FAVORS EXPANDING USE OF OUR DUE PROCESS FREE WATCHLISTS. A RARE BIPARTISAN MOMENT IN THIS EVENING! #debates
And now for a short break, meanwhile... Bernie Sanders with some sick vape tricks! #debatenight
If Trump wins I'm not paying my taxes. They'll just be squandered. Everyone cool with that? #Debates2016 #ImWithHer
A "Financial Statement of sorts" is NOT a tax return release #Debates2016
"I also have a much better temperament than she does--LET ME FINISH!" #Debates2016
@HillaryClinton is cheesing because Trump literally just digs himself deeper and deeper into a hole #DebateNight
"We need law and order." Donald Trump : Hillary Clinton :: Trial by Jury : SVU #debatenight
How Trump gonna say "excuse me" to the man in control of the debates lol
Those incredible airports are state funded - so you want to nationalize our airlines now? #Debates2016
I have a feeling that I will be blamed for everything tonight. Trump: why not? 😂 #Debates2016
Yes Hill bring up G Dub made the agreement to leave Iraq War #Debates2016
I'm hearing too many shots being thrown and not enough plans on change for the better of the country 💯 #DebateNight
Donald Trump: "Law &amp; Order: my favorite show. And all I know about policing." #debatenight
Did he just groan when she basically pointed out what he exactly said? What in the shit #debates
Again, with the facts and knowledge. And all he can say is 'Wrong,' because he is in so far over his head. #Debates2016 #ImWithHer
Its funny how Trump talks as though he isn't a politician...bruh...you're a candidate. You're not Farmer Joe. #debates #debatenight
#Trump - It's irrelevant that the Bush Administration let Baghdadi go from Abu-Ghraib after he saw the worst torture. Irrelevant. #debates
Love that Clinton just ignored what the DNC leaks revealed and the Bernie stuff #debatenight
We have to restore trust between communities and police, says Hillary Clinton  #Debates2016 #HillaryVsTrump #debatenight #debates
Trump must be sniffing because he's allergic to strong, powerful women. #debatenight
Way to call him out on those Iraq &amp; Libya lies, @HillaryClinton! #Debates2016
Did Trump just admit that he didn't pay taxes? "It would be squandered [if I paid] #Debates2016 #ReleaseTheReturns
Trump just said we should take guns away from some people! Does the @NRA know? Who picks and chooses what "criminals" lose 'em #Debates2016
The airports in Qatar, Dubai &amp; China are better than the US because they essentially use slave labor to build them #DebateNight #Debates2016
I have never flown in from Qatar. I have no idea what you're talking about. Please stop.  #Debates
"I have property in Chicago"...I can see inequality from my house #Debates
Your best attribute is your temperament...nah playa your temperament is embarrassing! U taunt people #DonaldTrumpisdilussional #debatenight
Great DT's 10yr old son might be out next cyber security secretary #Debates
Wow how big a contrast in style, temperament, global understanding and intelligence #Debates
Say what??? We need more second chances for criminals? I'm super scared of Satanas Clinton. #Debates
@Hillary remain proud of your performance tonight..."I prepared to be president. And I think that's a good thing." #Debates2016
Lester Holt:  "For the next 15 minutes, you must both speak in verse, rhyming all of your statements."  #debates
#Trump, history has not shown that tax cuts for the rich creates jobs #debatenight
trump is bringing up guns in gangs but not guns in the hands of police that just shows who he's blaming #Debates
Did he say somebody sitting on their bed weighing 400 pounds?! 😳🙊 #Debates2016
"You're wrong. Murders are up." - @realDonaldTrump that's all he's got left #Debates2016
Was it foolish to think this debate might move beyond personal insults and defensiveness at some point? #debatenight
Hey @realDonaldTrump , do you know what a Califate is and how it is relevant to IraqAnd Syria? #debatenight
giggle giggle wiggle wiggle oh look I'm a cute girl vote for my vagina #debatenight
Trump calls out Hillary's criminals on taking the 5th on her lying. #debates
How much of HRC's brain power goes into thinking about not coughing. If you start thinking about it, you might cough. #debatenight
Trump's temperament is so good that he keeps telling Lester Holt to stfu. What a classy guy. #DebateNight
If law and order was wrong, we would be fucked under Donald Trump. #Debates2016
Wikileaks hacked the DNC and exposed their bullshit amid the conventions. #BernieBetter #HillarySucks #Debates2016
"Stop and Frisk had a tremendous effect..." No. It didn't. The rate of violent crimes continue to decline in New York.#Debates
#debatenight Hey Hillary, there is no law that is racial in intent.   Right @benshapiro ??
This debate and possibly the whole presidential contest is surely over. Trump is obviously unfit to he president #debatenight
"We've become a third world country" in relation to the state of airports says trump #Debates
"Cyber warfare will be one of the biggest challenges for the next president" - Clinton #Debates
Why can't Donald Trump release old audits? You can see decades of returns, as Clinton rebuts. #debates #debatenight
#debatenight #Debates2016 #debate  Trump is so ridiculous and petty and plastic. That isn't how you win, Hillary.
#debatenight #Debates2016 #debate "That is The True Way I feel."  Yeah, I believe him.
"Listen to what you just heard" could be Hillary's response to every question and she would win this debate handily. #Debates2016
What's the point of having a twitter account if you aren't live tweeting this debate? @POTUS #Debates
#debatenight so the problem with ISIS is basically that our leaders couldn't negotiate well?  Is that a good defense w/Trump opposite you?
Stop stalling and answer the fucking race question. Ooommggg. She's saying common sense but not HOW.  #Debates
Woah Trump with a fat people joke. Took him long enough #Debates2016
Lester.  You can tell trump no.  You do know that right?  #debatenight
Trump just said that 'stop and frisk' wasn't found unconstitutional?!? Where has he been? #debatenight #Debates2016
@GavinSchall @realDonaldTrump @LesterHoltNBC more awkward when the crowd is silent. Easier to get away with during primary debates
Did trump really just say the fed is doing political things? Well...yeah...thats what federal government does... #Debates
Clinton and Trump  consistently derailing on every single question.  #Debates
Do Americans even want the jobs that are getting sent overseas? #debatenight
For the 1,998,678th time in this election, just saying "Wrong", doesn't make it wrong, Donald Trump. We all have Google now. #debatenight
I need a meme for Donald trump's "We had to take the oil" #debatenight
Also, not liking the job done doesn't mean you shouldn't pay for the work. Dickhead. @realDonaldTrump  #debatenight
I'm so confused... is #Trump just making wild accussation after accussation expecting one to stick? #debatenight
Donald Trump cannot talk about anything other than himself and his own wealth for more than 90 seconds at a time. #debatenight
"they sued many real estate firms" so you don't need to take responsibility just because you werent alone in ur discrimination? #debatenight
@realDonaldTrump wow what a child!  And come on Lester do your job. You are a journalist right? #debates
how many times is he going yo repeat the same rhetoric, and not answer the questions #Debates
40 mins in &amp; if I was an American .. #Trump would be getting my vote.. absolutely! #debatenight
I dont care what color you are, but if you commit a crime you should face consequences.  #Debates
I'm surprised @Snowden hasn't been brought up in the security section of the debates yet. #debatenight
#Trump "I'm gonna cut regulations." Translation: Make America Polluted Again Big League  #Debates
Maybe I was saving money not making ADs about you. Hilarity ensues in my living room #debatenight #Debates2016 #HillaryVsTrump
Cool he just said immigrants have guns and kill people cool cool cool #Debates
#StartingUnder greatest ever... It's true. It's not true? Trust me #ItsTrue cause I said it was #true  #Debates
“If you are too dangerous to fly, you are too dangerous to buy a gun.” - Hillary #debates #yass
If you're not following @ChuckTingle live tweeting the debates you're doing it wrong.
I agree with Trump in one thing. Are we sure it was Russia? #debatenight
Lol "Call my buddy Sean Hannity. He'll vouch for me". Look what it's come to 😂😂😂 #debatenight
When I was very young, I didn't want black people in my buildings. But I've totally changed. Pinky swear. #debatenight
Re: My support for the Iraq war. When you get caught lying, lie. Then lie again. And keep lying. #debatenight
This is more of a bloodbath than whatever football game is on right now. #debatenight
He should have made more of the emails, missed opportunity. Lied to congress, FBI and the American people.  #debatenight
#debatenight  I declare the winner of this presidential debate to be the Canadian housing market
Trump said we need more police!?!? Why would we want more cops killing innocent people #debatenight #Debates
Does Trump only know about places because of the fact he has properties there? #debatenight
This debate is just funny to me 😂 Trump is a joke! #debatenight
I don't care if you guys don't like Hilary but she's better than this idiot who doesn't know what's really know what's going on #debatenight
"Stop and Frisk" moment recalls the Commander in Chief Forum where Trump inaccurately "corrected" a Veteran on suicide. #debatenight
Clinton just admitted to wrongdoing better than anyone I've ever seen TBH. This is a big stage for owning up to a fuck up #debatenight
America is paying a high price for #freespeech tonight with Donald "Braggadocious" Trump. #Debates2016 #debatenight #taketheoil
Don: "we need to take guns away from people who shouldn't have them" BRO. Go say that in rural Kentucky and see what happens #debatenight
Maybe Bc I'm a COMM student that I catching all of this running around/dodging/evading of the question that he is doing. #debatenight
all he had to say for race issues.... "we need Law &amp; Order". #Debatenight
Hillary: I think that by the end of the night, I'm gonna be blamed for everything! Trump: Why not?   LOL, this man, yo. #Debates2016
So @realDonaldTrump's platform is "I have no political experience so I haven't officially fucked anything up yet." #debates #howdidwegethere
I am convinced every time @realDonaldTrump drinks water it is his way to keep himself in check #debatenight #PresidentialDebate
How many times can a person use bad in one sentence?? #debatenight
Where's Nancy Grace when you need her? "That's it cut his mic, cut it now" #shutupDonald #Debates
Everything he says comes back to his money, his holdings and his bullshit. #debatenight
Haha Trump just made democrat party by reminding world they screwed Bernie! #debatenight
Trump debates like a kid running for class president in middle school. #debates
You haven't released your tax returns and btw let's talk about the child rape case against you in the court system right now. #debatenight
So how Donald Trump gone show us how to run a bidness and he doesn't run his own? #debatenight
#Debates OK everyone, let's all restart our devices at the same time; maybe Trump will be gone on reboot. 📱🖥💻⌚️
Idk whether to laugh or cry that one of these two candidates is our future president #DebateNight
Very suprised @realDonaldTrump said we need to keep guns out of criminals. Usually that's a Democrat thing. #Debates2016
Another country does slightly better in infrastructure because they built it later Trump: WE'RE A 3rd WORLD COUNTRY  #debatenight
"Take guns away from these people, these are bad people,these are felons"-Trump's genius idea to have white only 2nd amendment #debatenight
"And that's the way I feel, that is the true way I feel." -Trump #Debates2016
Lemme know when there's a real question in the next 5 minutes #debatenight
@HillaryClinton "@BarackObama is a man of great dignity!" Her tone sure was different 8 years ago with the 3am phone call bit! #debatenight
A new drinking game on #debatenight and that's take a shot every time @realDonaldTrump says #seanhannity!!
If you hate our country, move away! Go now! It's not too late! #Debates2016
So Trump's platform is built on the fact that he isn't a "lying" politician and instead he's an everyday man? Gotcha. #debatenight
So...does Trump think that talking louder is gonna "win" a debate vs ANY female? 😂😂 name a guy who won an argument vs a woman. #Debates2016
Nixon used "law and order" rhetoric to justify the expansion of mass incarceration and the continued oppression of Black people #DebateNight
This is what happens when you nominate a man who's never read a book #Debates2016
Stop &amp; Frisk is unconstitutional. No you are wrong. DT Lawd help us. #debatenight
I can't do memes or gifs but can someone please do that for all of Trump's hand gestures? They're my favorite. #debatenight
#Trump has the biggest bigly and best Temperament Ever in the world, but the smallest hands #debatenight
@robertherjavec In your expert opinion is keeping classified material on a bathroom server a good idea? #debatenight

HRC: I think Donald just criticized me for preparing for this debate....and yes I did. #debates
Trump, just fucking admit that you were for the Iraq War. #Debates2016
Just because idiots call you a racist doesn't make you one.  #debatenight #neverhillary #HillaryLies #TrumpPence #clintonlies
Why do we care about tax returns? That's not going to solve any problem America has. Period.  #debatenight #MakeAmericaGreatAgain
All the yelling. Like listening to divorced parents argue. Cut the baby in half, Lester. Sigh. Let's see what happens. #Debates2016

For a man who is all about capitalism, I don't think Trump knows how capitalism works #youdontpaypeople?? #fortheirservices?? #debatenight
Just saying, but radically limited government sounds pretty good right now, right? #debatenight
Trump's syntax is god-awful atrocious. I dunno if I can make it through this debate. #DebateNight

One person is so smart, poised, and collected &amp; the other is just a messy bitch that loves drama. #debatenight
So... umm.... when are they gonna start throwing hands at each other? #debates
I'm not even old enough to vote but this shit gets me soooooo hyped #debatenight
Obama's libertarian enemies, like myself, treat Obama with more respect than Shillery and the Democrat cabals do #Debates2016
And for that matter, better to see enemies and treat 'em with wisdom, than to treat your frenemies with treachery #Debates2016
Hillary straight up looks like the Joker every time Trump says something she could potentially tear apart #debatenight
"He paints such a dire, negative picture of black communities in our country." - Trump #debatenight
"We've got to address the systemic racism in our criminal justice system." - Clinton #debatenight
Trump: "Stop and Frisk was great!" Moderator: "It was declared unconstitutional." Trump: "NO IT WASN'T." #Debates2016
It did not even occur to Trump even to go around the fact that he refused to pay the workers their right.  #debates

I was laughing and then I realized this is real life. Good gracious, America. #debatenight
Trump team should have had a Monica look-alike sit in the front row in a blue dress.  #DebateNight   #justsayin
#NATO is out of control &amp;not fighting terrorism..  ex: Paris attacks, Charlie Hebdo, Minnesota, New York, Brussels etc etc etc. #debatenight
Whenever someone says, "you can look it up," no one looks it up. #Debates2016
What you are saying is... it is okay for some to have guns but others not to? That's not racist at all 😒#debatenight #Debates2016
Was that Trump scoffing when Hil said we need to restore trust?!!  #DebateNight #justicereform #ImWithHer
Somewhere Fred Schneider just stood up and yelled “But I *feel* 23 years old!” #debatenight #debates
Yes look at the mess we're in. Now take a look at the mess we will be further in if you control our government #debatenight
Trump lying his ass off. He mad af. Stop lying wwhyyyyy youuu aalwaayyss lllyyyiiinnnnn #debatenight

Trump: “I have a winning temperament. I know how to win.” WTF??? #debates2016 #debatenight
It's only been 50 minutes? I don't know how much more I can take... #Debates2016
Should we expect @cologop &amp; #coleg GOP to just say "Wrong!" over &amp; over again every time they can't win a debate? #debatenight  #copolitics
So what happens when you need to take guns from police officers ? #Debates2016
😣 did he just say illegal #immigrants are gang members who shoot people? #debatenight #NYDebate  I squirmed
Settled with no admission of guilt ?? Soo does that mean not guilty?? He never answered the question😴 #NYDebate #debatenight
@deray 😂 y'all know Lester eating popcorn, trying not to laugh on the microphone! #Debates2016
WTF is this man talking about! In response to a question abt cyberterrorist he talks abt 400 lbs hackers &amp; his 10yr old son?!? #Debates2016
Hillary's programmers think smug, dismissive laughter look is a winner for her. She's losing voters in droves. #debatenight #Debates2016
Trump has big ideas, but can’t pay contractors and employees. Action speaks louder than words. #presidentialdebate #debate2016 #debatenight
What is she looking down at? Are her answers written down? #debate2016 #debatenight
Someone who sold out a great portion of our uranium to the Russians shouldn't talk about nuclear material in the wrong hands  #debatenight
Hillary is desperately trying to hold it together. I love her for that #ImWithHer #debatenight
Donald Trump is every bit as awful as expected; aggressive, boastful, uninformed - &amp; sniffing constantly too for some reason. #debatenight
#debatenight is what it was like talking to my dad every week.
Did Donald just support stop and frisk? Did Hillary just call us ALL racist? What is happening!? #debatenight
Somebody better have a GIF of Hillary shimmying to "Uptown Funk" by the end of the night OR ELSE! #debatenight
Hilary thinks she can delete America's financial issues just like she deleted them emails 😶 #debatenight
If mental health is such a big deal, let's get a senate vote on s.2680 #NAMI #debatenight
As a communications professional, I'm infuriated watching Trump because he's incapable of directly answering a single #debatenight question.
“We've become a third-world country.”  —A man who has never experienced a third-world problem  #Debates
According to Trump, it is not possible for people to get along after having a debate?  #Debates
"It's all soundbites."  No, Donald. You're all soundbites. Please drop out.  #debatenight
I put on #debatenight for some comic relief from the #MLB #ALWildcardRace ... failing to disappoint so far
LOL of the night: @realDonaldTrump "My strongest asset is my temperament"  ...Bahahahaha!!! 😂😂😂😂  #debatenight
I haven't given a lot of thought to NATO... (sadly, or to much else)  Donald Trump  #debates
donald can talk over anyone but if someone even makes a peep when he speaks he goes off #debatenight
My #debatenight must haves: a plate of meat and a beer. Possibly some aspirin after these people are done talking ...
Never realized that Trump wears his tie outside of his jacket. Weird. #debates #Debates2016 #debatenight
Turned on the debate and within two seconds I was angry. #debatenight
You can't talk about our national debt while you want to build a wall that will cost millions and millions of dollars #debatenight
also nobody who is not engaging in suspicious activity is audited every year for 15 years ok #debatenight
"I have a much better temperament than she does." - Trump LOLZ #debatenight
"Why were you still arguing it after 2011?" "... Yeah, I got nothing." #debatenight @debates
"No wonder you've been fighting ISIS your entire adult life!" Dude, ISIS hasn't EXISTED her entire adult life. #Debates2016 #debatenight
Why is Trump practically screaming? If Hillary yelled like this, she'd be called a bossy bitch. Misogyny, I see you. #debatenight
Laughable. @realDonaldTrump says he has a better temperament than @HillaryClinton. Proving himself WRONG tonight. #debates @MassforHillary
Hilary is gonna win the election based off of these debates because trump can't have a grown up conversation
Donald Trump looks desperate as fuck making shit up on the fly #debatenight
I love how Hillary is talking in slow motion and not raising her voice.   Noone needs to see her choking again.   #debatenight
Did he just say 600 million is not a lot of money? #debatenight #Hillary #Trump
But let's get back to the importance of a GOOD business vs an ETHICAL business #debatenight
The reference to the 400 lb. hypothetical hacker holed up in a room somewhere lost me.  #Debates2016
When Trump makes the point... "We need to move on"/"We are running out of time" #debatenight
Remembering what Michelle Obama said is easy because Melanya just repeated it recently #debatenight #Debates2016 #HILLYES
... because there aren't enough taxes and other monies to build things. #debates Ah, facts. Meet an Orange Circus Peanut. He doesn't shut up
I think we if minded our own damn business as a country, that could be a start to protecting us as a country, #debatenight
Hang on just callin my man Sean to clear things up... #DebateNight
#Debates2016 Trump is offering nothing of substance and he is doing nothing but bullying and blustering.  #HillaryQualified
He's going to take advantage of us! Like we are drunk on a prom night! #Debates2016
This report I saw that I don’t know what it said because it’s not real and i din’t read it #debatenight
Trump is going to heal the racial divide by building a wall and by killing off black people with his KKK buddies.  #debates #debatenight
You caught me, Trump. But I'm only 386 pounds and I did it on my couch, thank you. #debates
@realDonaldTrump   Shall we bring out the videos of you saying how wonderful Hillary was a couple years ago??  You lyin bag of dung #Debates
Wtf?? Hey #HillaryClinton and #Trump none of you both know anything about cyber security do you?  #DebateNight
"It's all words" Trump just won the debate by going EXISTENTIAL. Yes, all this talk is merely words. *long drag on cig, bongos* #Debates2016
@CBSNews Mr. Trump, if Mexico is so amazing why are you trying to keep them all out? #debatenight
Trump is a criminal who would bankrupt America. A blowhard who want the US government to serve his own interest. #Debates
"Braggadocious?  It's a word.  It's from Bedknobs and Broomsticks." - Trump #debatenight
Hillary and her campaign started the birthed movement in 2008! She is lying through her teeth! #DebateNight
The thought of either of these imperialist lunatics with nuclear weapons is positively terrifying. #debates #debatenight
He did not just say he has a better temperament - now he's just embarrassing himself badly #debates2016 #debatenight #sexism 102
"As far as the Cyber" .. The Trump is stuck in old AOL chat rooms in 2002. #debatenight
pretty sure trump just out loud admitted that he uses loop holes in the law to fuck over the middle class???????????????? #debatenight
@HillaryClinton's reaction to "I have a much better temperament" will be the FIRE .gif of the year. #debatenight #debates #Debates2016
#dropthemic moment when Hillary called Trump out on being upset she's prepared...Prepared to the the POTUS #boom #debatenight
"Donald, I know you live in your own reality". Gloves are off. No need to be polite. Also, he's started blustering quite early. #Debates2016
Hillary's meds seem to be holding up. I wonder how her diaper is doing. #debatenight
I don't care that he's crazy and says bullshit things but someone get Trump to stop giving duckface. #debates
check out my album dropping later this fall titled: mainstream media nonsense #debatenight
"You decided to stay home and that's ok"  #debatenight. "Yes I did stay home to prepare for the debate"
Hey! Hillary's coughing was allergies. Hey! Trump's sniffing is from snorting an illegal drug. #debatenight
Someone get Lester some coffee , he is falling asleep  #debatenight
So he's good at computers. Does this mean Donald Trump's 10 year old son ends up on his staff? #debatenight
Russia. Here we go. This is what I've been waiting for. #Debates2016 #TrumpPutin2016
Wait, did @realDonaldTrump  just get offended when he got "interrupted" ? #debatenight
Trump says stop/frisk reduce crime. He neglects to say that since stop/frisk stopped, crime rate still low in NYC. #Debates
Clinton literally wriggles w/ excitement, exclaims "woo" after Trump's ironic statement on his temperament #debates #debatenight weirdmoment
@catiyas @realDonaldTrump Nixon already proved u can be an ass and release ur taxes Btw Lester. #debatenight
RT 41ActionNews ".HillaryClinton says she thinks implicit bias is a problem for everyone. #debatenight"
trump telling hillary "I think what you want is..." is literally sexism #Debates2016
He's had numerous conversations with a guy that appeared in a pro Trump ad. Great. #debatenight #debates #Debates2016
Yes, Donald, we should bring back Law and Order it was an amazing show #DebateNight
Trump is speaking from heart and experience... Clinton has memorized a script. #debatenight
I'm watching this w a group of mostly strangers. I'd fuck any of them tonight because this experience is so deeply intimate. #DebateNight
Killary doesn't like insulting Muslims but has no problem with killing Muslims #Debates
.@realDonaldTrump, we need Law &amp; Order. And back door loopholes for me to ignore the spirit of the law. #debatenight
She wants our police to have more training to deal with the niggas #debatenight
Yeah Donald!  Tell Lester Holt, a black man, what being a minority is like, he wouldn't know! :) #debatenight
Everyone patting themselves on the back about HRC's logical points is missing Donald making an emotional connection to undecideds #Debates
Quick guys, just distract the audience with a comedy routine until we fix the malfunctioning hologram of Lester Holt. #debatenight
Trump is drinking a lot of water. Wonder who will get back from the bathroom 1st #debatenight
hillary deserves to be president solely bc she's been able to sit through this debate w/o punching trump #debates
Not once has Secretary Clinton shouted over him during his time. That says a lot. She has social skills. We are social beings. #debates
Trump said our airports are like third world countries. I think @PHLAirport is very nice. #DebateNight #Debates
"I'm certainly relieved my late father didn't do business with you." #debatenight
When two people are this full of crap, it reveals their radical self-interests. Can't watch anymore. #debatenight
After the first section of the debate, I thought both candidates actually had specific plans that seemed based in logic...(1/2) #debates
If Stop and Frisk was so successful, it wouldn't be spoken of only in the past tense. #Debates2016 #debates
Ahhhh man this debate really makes me miss roasting and destroying my Liberal high school teachers in in-class debates
"There are a lot of great business people that have never taken bankruptcy once" - @HillaryClinton #debatenight
"No, the argument is that we have to take the guns away from these people" - @realDonaldTrump defending stop and frisk #debatenight
"We would put money into that budget to help deal with implicit bias by retraining our police officers" @HillaryClinton #debatenight
"No one should disagree about respecting the rights of young men who live in those neighborhoods" @HillaryClinton #debatenight
Trump says we have to bring back law &amp; order in the inner cities. Says we have to have stop &amp; frisk @13NewsNow #Debates2016
.@realDonaldTrump talks inner city crime and illegal immigrants. Now, he argues with @LesterHoltNBC on stop and frisk. #debatenight
The "That makes me smart" remark is him flat out admitting he doesn't pay taxes, yes? #debatenight
Trump is talking to Hillary about being disrespectful to other debaters. This man is truly beyond irony. #debatenight
The way that Donald Trump tells it, all of us black people are living miserable lives waiting to be saved by our white saviors. 🙄 #debates
Could we get Clinton's perspective with Trumps vocal chords? I think that would be perfect. #debates
Hillary, you're wrong. In addition to saying "Law and Order." The Donald also said it was gonna be a "beautiful thing." #debatenight
@MichaelSkolnik ur spot on and I am sure no one will tell him he should have smiled more. U know double standard. #debate2016 #debatenight
WHY IS TRUMP USING HIS TIME TO DEFEND RUSSIA 😂😂😂 #Debates2016   this is tew merch
I don't want to know what trump is going to say about race. #debatenight
Without a hint of sarcasm, Trump says his strongest asset is his temperament immediately after a five minute temper tantrum. #debatenight
Did he really just say "being audited is a way of life (to me)" #debatenight
@deray @Charlie_Carver yeah, I said the same thing. He always seem to slip in his brags income and success every time he speak #debatenight
Cmon Trump you know President Obama will play more than golf. He likes basketball too. #Debates2016
YESSSSSSS!!!!!! @HillaryClinton Biased against POCs is not just about police - it’s about everyone!!!!! #debatenight #Debates2016
Trump lasted about 30 minutes before eliciting gasps from the audience #debatenight
I wish Hillary would talk more about what she will do as President rather than reflecting on DT's past. C'mon Hillary. #Debates2016
Did he just say, "That makes me smart," re: not paying taxes? Make America great again! #Debates2016
"We have become a third-world country." Okay. That's just disrespectful to suffering, lesser-developed nations/states. #Debates2016
I had no idea hackers are people who weigh 400 pounds and sit on their bed. #Debates2016
no matter who wins in this race...we all lose...these two are terrible &amp; corrupt candidates...#BringBernieBack #Debates2016
#debatenight Hillary's attack on Trump's business and connecting to her middle class background very effective.
Donald Trump would like to phone a friend during the debates.
Love when the person who called young African-Americans "super-predators" talks about racial bias #debatenight
In compression to these 2 posers Obama looks like Franklin Delano Roosevelt! #debates #Debates2016
If 'white people' are "implicitly racist" I am very interested to hear @HillaryClinton's ideas about human nature #debates2016
How many times will Lester say " it's @HillaryClinton 's 2 minutes"??? #debatenight
#debatenight Howard Stern makes his debut! I'll remember this moment. The rest of the world just said; Howard who?
I honestly don't think Clinton's answer on race was all that great. But Trump's is a total tire fire. #debatenight
oh god he just opened a debate with the host of the debates on race and gun violence...#debates #Debates2016
Because Stop and Frisk will help women/police and black/police relations...wtf donald #debates #Debates2016
"I did a great job proving to the president that he was born in the US" --Donald #debates #Debates2016
Trump continues to accuse Hillary for all the problems of the world, and I want to know what he has done @realDonaldTrump #debates
Ouch. I have a headache from all of the eye rolls🙄 #debates #debatenight
#debatenight when this debate is to be a deciding factor in the future of Amerikkka and trump wants to talk about his "accomplishments"...
Donald Trump will change his numbers in two seconds. First it was "1,000 killings since Jan" and 2 secs later it was "3,000" #debates
Hello @LesterHoltNBC how much time does she get? You are forcing him to interrupt!!!  #debatenight
Dammit Lester!!!  You're letting him do whatever the hell he wants!! #debatenight
Why is Lester grilling him on his tax release this is one of those one-sided left he moves #Debates
*Hears Trump's argument*  My thoughts: "This is bullshit"   *Turns off TV*   #debatenight
Trump- Please let me talk more about how great, and big a fraud I am! #debatenight
#debatenight   racial discrimination.   Bring it, Hillary!!    Long record of engaging in racist behavior.  #ImWithHer
"Your President." What?!?! President Barack Obama is the President of the United States! #debatenight #Debates2016 #ImWithHer #MSNBC
How many times is #Trump going to interrupt and throw fits during the #debates ?
@realDonaldTrump 🙊I'm mean.Orangutan. Could you stop yelling and talking over@HillaryClinton! Ans the ? #Hillary for President #Debates2016
Trump must be super butthurt that Law &amp; Order got cancelled. That, or he's some kind of crypto-fascist asshole. Probably that. #debatenight
#U cant rely on someone who bases policies off of news headlines they read "4 months ago" #debatenight #USPresidentialDebate
#debates Guess #Hillary thinks charity at home has value since HER giving was all to HER Foundation. Which pays 9mill or do for their travel
#debates #Trump right on that #DEM &amp; #politicians promise the world to minorities at election time &amp; #DONOTHING to help inner cities.
When D doesn't want to answer a question D will mention Isis,the wall,what he wants on his burger,the tanning machine he uses  #Debates2016
@LesterHoltNBC buddy you need to hush the @realDonaldTrump. Civilized discourse requires compromise.   #debatenight
Difficult for me to see how #Americans see choice in candidates. To me seems only 1 legitimate candidate. @HillaryClinton #debatenight
How the fuck was bullying Obama into "producing his birth certificate" about racial healing? And he thinks that's a great thing.#debatenight
If people don't know Trump is delusional after tonight, then i am not sure what more it would take #debates
I may have a heart attack before this thing is over #debatenight
Trump is just offering the same tradition of Neoliberal economics. He isn't offering new ideas, he's just parroting the same views #debates
You don't learn much from tax returns? Really Trump?! The fuck is he talking about #debates
"China should go into North Korea"- diplomacy according to Trump folks #debates
All right HRC on fire now. "We have to address systemic racism.  We can't just say "law and order." #debates
Trump thinks numbers are so fascinating &amp; impressive that every number he thinks of, he repeats over and over. #debatenight
@JKuvs we won't have a country without law and order. we need better relationships between our communities and our police.#DebateNight
Howard Stern brought up in the #debates. Baba Booey to you all.
Funny how #Trump is the only one saying or hearing these things about his tax returns #debatenight
Who is this Tara Trump keeps talking about? She sounds very important lmao  .... #Troll #debatenight
This idiot said "your president thinks" he's yours too bih... you're not president yet nor will you be #Debates2016
It is neck and neck for who had greater patience tonight: @HillaryClinton or @LesterHoltNBC. #Debates
I'm sorry- YOUR president? He's yours, too. Military members still serve their commander, even if they don't like him #debatenight #debates
"Systemic racism" Lady. Point out the individual racists. Stop ghost hunting for Pete's sack. #debates
So... Did Lester Holt go out for dinner? 'Cause somebody needs to get ahold of this thing. #debates
Hillary doesnt think for profit prisons should profit off of minorities. Is that why they are overwhelmingly donating to her? #debatenight
Here's Hillary on cue citing the unproven statement that Russia is hacking the US &amp; DNC. War-mongerer Hillary. #debatenight
Should change Trumps name to rump so his supporters can be rump kissers lol  #debatenight
I feel like in being yelled at. *hugs dog, watches debates from the 80s.* #debatenight
Hillary should've worn the pirate black yeezys with her outfit...she got my vote but she would've had my vote off rip lol #debatenight
Trump says he will release tax returns when Clinton gives up deleted emails. #Debates2016
Did you just tell @LesterHoltNBC he's wrong? For real? What is wrong with you? #Debates2016
Trump is saying we need law and order? Too bad your rallies don't know what that is....#debatenight
Doing yoga while watching the #debates is a great way to feel calm and upset at the same time #DebateNight
You're right, Donald. What you're saying IS unbelievable. Because you are a pathological liar. #debatenight
I haven't seen history being rewritten so quickly since Marty McFly went back to Hill Valley. #debatenight #donalddouchebag
also, can we move past the tax returns + emails? I do not care and want to hear them speak to real issues please. #Debates2016
'We need to knock the hell out of ISIS' - yeah... tonight may be the first Trump has heard of NATO #Debates2016
I prepared to be President and that's a good thing - @HillaryClinton #debatenight
Cut taxes for himself then file bankruptcy and loose your debt leave poor business with your debt. #debatenight
The true way I feel is that Donald Trump is the spawn of Satan #debatenight
This guy doesn't even deny he doesn't pay taxes!!! Y'all still voting for him!!! 😂😂😂😂 #Debates2016
This will be a criminal justice reform vs. Law &amp; Order discussion. #debatenight
Trump: "I have a much better temperament than her."   *Audience laughs*   #Debates2016 #HRC #ImWithHer
The @theroots should start playing some music after their 2 mins is up. #debatenight #Debates2016 #shutup
EXACTLY! That's not how the law works! That's not how any of this works! @tweek75 #debatenight
"I prepared to be president, and that's a good thing." Boom! #ImWithHer #debatenight
Really you bring up the birth certificate? How does this help us decide who to vote for NOW??? #debates
@HillaryClinton talks abt the need for police training and restoring trust in communities + talks abt the need for gun reform. #debatenight
I don't mind my audits. I love my audits. They're great. I get the best audits. #debatenight
fml.....there are 2 more debates.😓 I don't think that I can't handle anymore Drumpf.....💩
Before #DebateNight even started, I knew #LesterHolt was going to have the worst night of his life. Should we nominate him for sainthood?
ISIS is real. Police Brutality is real. Shit being broadcast for the world to see the debate on a fake birth certificate. #debatenight
Lester Holt, saying...."I'm just here so I won't be fined." I need him to up is Moderation. #debates2016
How many kids are watching Trump tonight and thinking to themselves... they too can grow up to be fact checkers? #debatenight
How ironic that their outfits are beautifully coordinated like a married couple??? #debatenight
Trump was asked about the birther scandal and said that he did it to move on and fight ISIS. Lord help us all. #DebateNight
"I'm all for NATO" -except you're not -you don't pay your federal taxes #2016debate #debatenight
If we could supply power to the US solely on eye rolling we would have electricity at least until 2036 #Debates2016 #debatenight
Awwwww @realDonaldTrump bought a Word of the Day calendar that had "braggadocios" in it. #debatenight
T hasn't thought about NATO but thought they should pay their bills--unlike T who has stiffed thousands.  #Debates2016
Criminal justice reform, police respect of communities they are policing &amp; gun reform. Not law &amp; order #debatenight
Donny loves the rambling non-sequiters. Sean Hannity, what? This fuckin' guy. #debatenight
#debatenight I dont care about the past.  It is what we do today and in the future.
like it realize the debates aren't supposed to be entertaining but the media hyped it up like it was the fucking hunger games
Donald Trump: Illegal immigrants have illegal guns and advocates “stop and frisk” #debatenight
He just said he used the laws to be a crooked businessman, so you know he would use the laws to be a crooked politician. #Debates2016
Thank you for putting the blame where it belongs...on Bush NOT Obama. #Debates2016
let's all agree both of them suck ass and don't deserve to be pres #debatenight
#Debates #debatenight I just can't see a temperamental guy like Trump meeting with the leaders of other countries. So many wars 😳
#debatenight trump is actually nodding at Hilary. He is such a boof.
#debatenight look closely at what brings you pleasure. Looks closer still at what brings you pain.
Trump says he'll release his tax returns when Clinton releases her deleted emails.#Debates2016
If Hillary's dad was essentially an interior designer, you'd think she'd have better taste #debatenight
Trump is OUT OF CONTROL. A small sample of how he'd be as POTUS--Short fused and out of control. #KeepTrumpAwayFromNukes  #debatenight
Give each one of them a gun and let's save America #debatenight
If Donald Trump really wants to help businesses, why is he hurting small businesses? #DebateNight #debates
I don't follow politics too closely. Never watch debates. Soccer and Disney Twitter: is the good candidate holding herself well?
"...I also prepared to be the president of the United States and I think that's a good thing..." -Hillary Clinton #DebateNight #Hillary2016
If there's one burning issue in this election - it's airport facilities. #debatenight #ClintonVsTrump
"IT'S A GOOD ONE THO." - hill dog, and she right #ImWithHer #debatenight
Trump wants to pillage? That's NOT what we do &amp; he's STILL denying his support for the war? #DontheCon #debatenight #debates #ImWithHer
It's hilarious to watch these "journalists" and "unbiased news sources" share their take on the #debates. #biasalert #Debates2016
This feels exactly like a lead up to a major tantrum. #debatenight
GOD PLEASE HIT ALT+F4 ON THIS SIMULATION PLEASE WE HAVE FAILED YOU PLEASE BEFORE TRUMP SAYS ANYTHING ELSE #Debates2016
How many times is golf going to be mentioned tonight? Any guesses? #debatenight
GovGaryJohnson: .HillaryClinton: it's not whether it's "effective" - it's whether it violates the #constitution! #stopandfrisk #debates
Keep double checking that I'm not in my work Twitter acct! #debatenight
Donald Trump is like a little kid who dont get shit his way #Debatenight
Neither one of these answers about race is going to be about race at all #debatenight
First it was 1,000...now it's 3,000 shootings in Chicago... #debatenight  Does anyone have the exact facts?
How can Hillary say she is for jobs when she has stated she will put Kentucky/WV coal miners out of business? #debatenight
Trump: In Chicago, they've had thousands of shootings since January 1st. Where is this, a war torn country? #debatenight
Guns, um most of us have been unarmed &amp; killed by armed officers of the law...  #debatenight
The policy debate war flashbacks I get every four years is the reason why I drink during #DebateNight
Trump won't answer the questions. He goes in on another subject. Why? #Debates
damn give Donald Trump and Oscar for this performance on pretending he cares about people #debatenight
He's going to give himself a heart attack. I'm genuinely scared for what I'm about to witness. #debatenight
Trump has the audacity to challenge Clinton on her debate demeanor and how she treats people. #Debates2016
Clinton just drop kicked Trump in the face over his legacy of racist hatred. #debatenight
@Morning_Joe Did you hear anything about Trump's nose being mic'd up? Why do I keep hearing him snort? #debatenight
Was there a question about how many banks can you name?  #debatenight
I literally just did dishes rather than subject my ears to a birther discussion #debatenight
As much as I hate to admit it, Trump is having a good night. #debatenight
Obama "went high", but not as high as Trump is on the coke that's making him sniff right now. #tytlive #debatenight
Wouldn't want anyone dangerous like, oh say, Iran, to get ahold of nukes #Debates2016
I'm just glad I was already a bottle of wine deep before I started watching this presidential debate. #debatenight #fucktrump #jillnothill
@realDonaldTrump How would we have "taken the oil" exactly? Some sort of super villain device that just drains all the oil? 🙄🙄🙄#debatenight
I think Donald just criticized me for preparing for this debate. I also prepared to be president. #dropthemic #debatenight #HillaryClinton
^Do I remember correctly that Sean Hannity confirmed Trump told him he was against War but "there are no tapes"? #debates
I feel like there shouldn't even be nuclear weapons but it's too late for tht 🙃🤔 #Debates
His supporters are so dumb that he says "law and order" like a dozen times and they piss their pants and vote for him. #debates #debatenight
Is there a place I could go to find all of the presidential debates? Somehow they are always during class time and I miss out on the chaos.
Did @realDonaldTrump just demand that even the most powerful black man in the world "show me his papers"?  #Debates2016 #debatenight
Can we please get a moderator with some balls for once? #Debates2016
What did gun violence aka coded way of saying black on black crime have to do w the question 🤔 #debatenight
@OnionPolitics listening to debates on radio while watching Mariners in pennant race - Trumps nose inhales are epic. Please comment
Trust cannot be restored with those who systematically kill black people #DebateNight #Debates #BlackLivesMatter
Trump summation on ISIS: "We shudda taken the oil, made a bunch of oily butt plugs, and plugged up ISIS before theyz begun." #debatenight
Crime is down almost everywhere in the country. Trump is fanning fires that don't exist.  #debatenight
I really wouldn't want to be the @Comcast employee who takes this phone call I tell you what.  If they ever take it.  #debatenight
Things Lester Holt wishes he had right now: - Gavel - Whistle - Megaphone - Taser - Tranquilizer darts #debatenight
@realDonaldTrump "I have property there" is not an argument. Neither is stupidity. #DebateNight #ImWithHer @HillaryClinton
Hold on... how did @BarackObama and @HillaryClinton make the vacuum? They didn't start the war... #debatenight
Saying "I guess" is admitting you were for the war in Iraq, Trump. #debatenight
Dear @realDonaldTrump, no one is surprised but you have FAILED this discussion on race. Stop &amp; frisk?! I can NOT.  #debatenight
And now Trump is argue/lying with Lester Holt, because THAT is what this is all about. #debatenight
And he does refute it. "No admission of guilt". I.e. Everyone was being racist, so it was fine. #DebateNight
I am the best at being audited. No is as good at being audited as me. You can ask everyone, everyone talks about it. #debatenight
650m = not a lot of money. 14m = small loan. #debates
THIS JUST IN: Suspects from the DNC hack: Russia, China, possibly another person, or someone in bed who weighs 400 LBS. #debates
Stop and frisk???? @realDonaldTrump you can suck a bald eagle dick. You really don't get it.  #Debates2016
Trump's 10-year-old son is going to clean up The Cyber once and for all. #Debates2016
So did #Trump support #Iraq or not? That is the question. Seems everyone's saying he did, he insists not. Yeah or nay? #debatenight #qtna
"They" have guns and shoot people because of the 2nd amendment. #debatenight
Hillary is doing more than Trump is doing backwards in heels #Debates2016
Her response was "just listen to what you heard" ..... bitch!!! Hahahaha! #debatenight
Just because you're the loudest in the room doesn't mean you're the smartest #debatenight
What's with Donald's sniffing? Illness or a little coke to prepare for #debates2016
"Nobody calls Sean Hannity." Hey, first fact of the night from Trump! #debatenight
What does it tell you about politics in America when @HillaryClinton supports W's war actions! #debatenight
But can we ask the tough questions please... What is a catch ? #debatenight
Will Trump's "I have a good temperament, I have a very good temperament" be the beginning of him losing this #debatenight ??
Only people that are lying or  don't know what they're talking about have to yell and talk over ppl to prove a point #Debates2016
He's breathing hard again...gee, Donald,  do you have a cold? Or panicky? #Debates2016
I feel like Donald is about to pull a Jerry Springer. Is that why they're so far apart? #debatenight
"how do you stop people from dying?" trump: easy. don't die. #debatenight
I so badly want @SenWarren 's Burn Book to be a thing, and to see it after tonight #debatenight
Brother trump HOW will you heal the divide?????? #debatenight damnnnnnnnn! President my ass
A man provoked by a tweet should not have his hand next to the nuclear codes! @HillaryClinton #Debates2016 #docswithher
"The city where I have investments."  Translation: I hope the protestors don't destroy my property.   #debates
So @realDonaldTrump has expectations so high that he won't pay for something if he doesn't like it? #debatenight
"It could be someone sitting on their bed that weighs 400 pounds" #debatenight #debates
Is everyone drunk yet from this drinking game on the debate? #debatenight
The fact that Lester is keeping his composure is amazing. I would have started a knock-down drag-out by now. So kudos to him. #debatenight
My timeline: The presidential debate Me: tired, doodling, watching adventure time  #debatenight
'I know a lot of wealthy people' I think that's his new catch phrase. Everybody drink! #debatenight #drinkinggames
"Trump is hiding something."  -Hillary Clinton  B**** you talking? I'm sorry but really? #debatenight
wow, if looks could kill, Donald would be a pair of smoking shoes right now… #debatenight
TRUMP LITERALLY JUST. SAID. HILLARY AND OBAMA FORMED ISIS. I AM,,,,DIS.GUSTED #debatenight
Love the @HillaryClinton tax return spiel. Best moment of the night for her so far. #debatenight  @GUPolitics
"I have a winning temperament." Is Trump at the same debate I'm watching? #debatenight
If America has became a third world country, what does that make the rez? #Debates
Hillary is pissed again when Trump mentions her &amp; Obama's Isis vacuum disaster. #DebateNight #PresidentialDebate #FoxNews
Its funny that Donald trump haven't answered not one question in this debate.. #debatenight
Trump's answer to healing the racial divide is Law and Order? GTFOH!! #debatenight
Now Obama and Clinton created a vacuum that ISIS filled. I thought they founded it? Which is it, Trump? #debatenight
#debatenight Donald,  you supported Iraqi invasion on the radio. I remember hearing it,  stop lying. #stopthetrumptrain
Trump just said #stopandfrisk worked in NYC, this man is insane &amp; doesn't care that it's been ruled unconstitutional #debatenight
Yeah in regards to Obama, Hillary you can't forget your past words. #DebateNight
Trump says he'll release his taxes if Clinton releases her deleted emails.  #debatenight #Debates2016
I wonder how middle America will read Trump's openly admitting that he did not pay people he thought did a poor job... #debatenight
WTF, some hackers are svelte! IT does NOT make you fat. #debatenight
Why is Trump allowed to speak as long as he'd like? #Debates2016
Seriously America, trump can't win. Just watching and thinking of the possibility him gives me anxiety. #debatenight
Hey Hillary why don't you live in an inner city black community, if it's so great? #Hypocrite #Debates2016
So the answer on the racial divide is a bunch of buzzwords and glossing over got it. #debatenight
I'm honestly not learning anything from this debate. &amp; Trump and Clinton are saying the Same thing differently. #debatenight
I think instead of debates we need to just have both candidates on Wild 'n Out.
"I have a winning temperament." "I have a much better temperament than her." What planet does this guy live on? #debates
"It's a good one tho *wicked side eye*" - Hillary Clinton, 2016 #debatenight #debates #Debates2016
If @realDonaldTrump says "Believe me" one more time I'm going to be wasted #debatenight
#Debates2016 @realDonaldTrump believe me, believe me, believe me. The sign of a liar.
At least those associated with Trump and his past haven't mysteriously wound up dead. How many are we at now for Clinton? #Debates2016
Donald calls himself the King of Debt. Don't know if he earned @DaveRamsey's vote with that one! lol.. #DebateNight
Donald is on the defensive. He's all over the place tonight. Hillary is calm and collected, except for that first segment. #DebateNight
Trump proud of his racism? No wonder David Duke supports him. #Debates2016
Ban clothing. There's no stop and frisk or concealed carry if you're naked. #debatenight
Trump just made fun of fat nerds...  what the hell man? #debatenight
I think the real reason @realDonaldTrump doesn't pay taxes is because his W-2 comes from Vladimir Putin. #debatenight
It's going to be really hard to change my mind that anyone voting Trump is an idiot... #debatenight
Re: the temperament comment — I wish HRC would’ve unleashed her glorious, glorious laugh at that. #debatenight
#Debatenight I don't want a president who won't be transparent about his finances and hides what he's done.
#Debatenight @realDonaldTrump speak for yourself -- and quit telling us what words someone else won't use. #deflecting
If you take Trump's stream of consciousness answers and then reorder the words later, will it make sense? #bytheway #debates
Not as rich, charitable, may be in debt? What about your #PayToPlay #ClintonFoundation #BleachBit #debatenight #Debates2016 #debates
"My son helps me turn on the internet! He is so good with computers!" -Trump... kinda... #debatenight
People laughed at Texas for wanting to succeed,  but who's laughing now?  #debatenight   Come with me if you wat to live.
"I made a mistake having a private email."  "When you have your staff taking the 5th...I think it's disgraceful."  pfftttttt #Debates2016
"The gun epidemic is the leading cause of death."  I think they'd kill themselves whether they had guns or not. #Debates2016
So by Donald's logic, if POTUS had to produce his birth certificate then maybe he should he produce his tax returns. #debatenight
"We need law and order," says candidate who is proud on not paying taxes. #debatenight
"According to a report that I saw" that is a sound reference... #Debates2016
I need th get the new trump dictionary with as many words he has made up. #debate #DebateWithBernie #debatenight
I think our airports are pretty nice. I mean, the lines are sometimes long, I'll give you that. #debatenight
Taking the oil? Mr. Trump, you can't just take someone's oil, but you can throw away your integrity... #debatenight
Exactly our country needs rebuilt. That's what the taxes should be going to. #Debates
That's true the law and the people are not respecting each other #Debates
Yes race topic . I would love to hear this  #debatenight
On #birtherism Trump rambles and rambles and rants and rants. He's useless and he should deal with his adenoids! #debatenight
"Trump you didn't get him to produce a birth certificate" "I did" "He produced it in 2011" "I made him produce it this year" #Debates2016
The audience laughing when he says he has a "winning temperament" might be the best moment of this debate #ImWithHer #Debates
@HillaryClinton "the police need to  respect communities" ...How about criminals respect the community by not breaking the law #debatenight
Hillary says she has all these plans to help our economy. Where has she been the last 30 yrs? #DebateNight
Remember that time @realDonaldTrump promoted his business during the #debatenight #Debates2016, if not just rewind a tad.
Trump is just practicing the smolder look to many times for my liking #debatenight
OUCH  Hillary kind of just made Trump look like a moron...  Something anyone with half a brain could do...&amp; it took her this long  #Debates
.@HillaryClinton: Lists things she's accomplished. @realDonaldTrump: I've made lots of money and impress myself bigly. #debates #debatenight
I can't wait to hear them talk about race. Trump is screwed. #debatenight
I wonder what music is playing in his head when Trump goes on a factless, rambling babble? Think it's cartoon stuff? #Debates2016
I'm so disappointed in how this debate was conducted. This should be fact checked #debatenight
#Debates Trump got a point there. Lol lets not be buddy buddy now Hill.
This is the guy half of you want in possession of the nuclear football? What is wrong with all of you? #debatenight
Release your tax returns like she released her tax returns. Then release all of your email and she will too. #Debates2016
The only thing more problematic than Donald Trump is the fact the Tigers are blowing it &amp; will likely miss the wild card. #debatenight #MLB
You can never go wrong when you quote Michelle Obama. Well played Clinton #debates #debates2016 #debatenight
Trump: If we had taken the oil, ISIS wouldn't have formed. #Trumperialism #Debates2016 #debates #debatenight
Over under on deleted tweets from the @realDonaldTrump camp? Im saying 2,000. #debatenight
He knows republicans are the majority right? Is he speaking about those politicians letting African Americans down? #Debates2016
OMG someone let @HillaryClinton aware that @realDonaldTrump's team is deleting old tweets of him talking shit #Debates2016
This is like Katie and the nerdy girl at the mathletes both saying "the limit does not exist" at the same time. #Debates
The other guy who had a winning temperament?  Charlie Sheen. Has AIDS. #debates
I love how every person  who don't know a SINGLE thing about politics automatically say they hate trump like ur opinion is invalid #debates
Barely halfway through the debate and Trump is already off his rocker with anger.  What a short fuse.  #debates #debatenight
I'm fairly sure my lego creations were better real estate assets. And i paid the contractor (myself) in cookies.  #debates #debatenight
His 2 minutes are up. Let's hope that doubles for his 15. #Drumpf #debates
HRC successfully firing up the Donald, which is bad for him. #Debates2016 #debatenight #debates
Literally peeing in my pants from laughing so hard at how bad Trump is at this debate!!! #debatenight #Debates2016
Why you keep bringing up Obama ? Like let him leave Trump #debatenight
You don't learn that much from tax returns-- even my 9 year-old called that one out #debatenight
"That makes me smart. " @realDonaldTrump response to not paying federal taxes. 😂#debatenight
I think he might explode. Or plug Sean Hannity a hundredth time. #debatenight
feel sorry hillary not being able to roll her eyes bc i am in a constant state of 🙄🙄🙄 rn #debatenight
I honestly have not seen two people argue like such small children since grade-school. #debatenight
#Debates2016 *sniff* Damn, my nose is itchy &amp; runny. But it's a beautiful nose. The best runny nose ever. See how beautiful it is?  *sniff*
Trump would have been kicked out of every MUN conference. They would have told him "Decorum delegate!" and he would've sued. #Debates2016
@realDonaldTrump If Fed's doing "political correct thing" so that you won't be elected.I think Fed is going above and beyond#Debates2016
Donald Trump is getting embarrassed  He'll be gone soon ✌🏻️😂 #TeamClinton #debatenight
Maybe you wouldn't get audited if you didn't treat your foundation like your piggy bank, Donald.  #debates
Trump calls out the corruption of the #DNC and Debbie Wasserman Schultz #debatenight
Oh HILL NO you cannot say a damn thing about "cyber security" after your handling of emails @FFL_of_America #debatenight #DebateWithFFL
For the love of God, he's going to keep lying about the #birther nonsense. #debatenight
"Well we're way behind schedule" come on Lester don't draw attention to your flaws!!! Debating 101 #Debates
Did he really? Stop &amp; frisk again? Cops afraid to do anything? Think they're 2 quick to do the biggest thing &amp; use their guns #debatenight
way to just insult the people that do the hard stuff for you trump #debatenight
A bar is the only appropriate place to watch a debate with Donald Trump in it. #debatenight
#debatenight Is Hillary still claiming to be poor?  Come on....I picture their vault like Walter White's filled with stacks of cash...
#debatenight #debates  Waiting for Hillary to say Bill was for 'stop and get frisky'....Oh, pleaseeee.
Being one of many real estate firms that's being sued doesn't make it better. #debatenight
He's soooo toast. I guess I can stop watching now. Welcome to the White House Hillary. #bankruptcy #debates
The entire audience just audibly scoffed when @realDonaldTrump said his temperament is his best asset #debatenight
Hillary's jokes get worse and worse the more and more she says them #debatenight
I have much better judgment than she does and much better temperament @realDonaldTrump #debatenight
See how Trump can't control himself - he interrupts continuously.  No self control.  #debatenight
Wow.  I knew Clinton would do better than Trump, but I had no idea that he would crash like this. #debatenight
Now we'll here how he tries to talk his way out of rental discrimination #debatenight
Wah wah wah!!! I'm right! That sums up DJT right now. #debatenight
Trump: "I'm right because I'm louder." Don't play his game Hillary, you'll lose. #debatenight
Hillary's been fighting ISIS her entire adult life? Wow she looks a lot older than she is. I had no idea! #debatenight
Disgraceful is using money people give you for charity to buy your own portrait TWICE!!!! #debatenight
I prepared to be President and that's a good thing -- Clinton #Debates2016
Trump is pointing out how Hillary screwed Bernie. Great strategy. He just hit the proverbial tombstone piledriver on her. #debatenight
.@DrJillStein just as you went to the wrong airport, apparently you aren't watching the right debates. They started with jobs.
his voice is so annoying, i can't believe they call her shrill.... #Debates2016
alright 10 minutes with Ronald, (actually 10 minutes) as soon as the debate is over......... #debatenight
No amount of RTs will get me to release my deleted emails tho. #debatenight (Okay, probably 10,000)
Trump says 500 murders are too many. Hillary says 1 is too many. I say we split the difference. #250 #debatenight #Makin2016
If you think either candidate is winning this debate you're blind, deaf and biased. These two are clowns stumbling all over. #Debates2016
How many jokes is hillary gonna make before people realize her campaign is the biggest one #debatenight
Omg, Donny Cheetos just said Hillary having a plan is somehow helping the enemy, this is like a glorious train wreck #debatenight
1 hr into debate and this shit has never been better #debatenight
"UR WRONG" -Trump and also me when someone implies im not cute. #debatenight
Trump says he's smart bc he didn't pay any tax. What does that make the rest of us, the middle class? Stupid? #Debates2016
Well , #LesterHolt is about as useful as a Chocolate Teapot tonight #debatenight
What's your guesses? How high is Trump's blood pressure at moment? #debatenight
@realDonaldTrump has no substance in terms of solutions.  The few ideas he has are failed ones like trickle down economics #debatenight
Just looked it up. New York murder rates are low and dropping. #debates #debatenight
"There's been 30,000 shootings in Chicago in the last 3 seconds"- trumps next claim #debatenight
"Broad-based inclusive growth is what we need in America, not more advantages for [those at the top.]" #DebateNight #ImWIthHer
Bringing communities together is the only way to end the racial divide #debatenight #GoHillary
Yep because when I’m thinking about who to vote for my first thought is “wonder who my police department endorses?” #DebateNight
SuMo news should come out right now, no one would get views #debates
muting when one of the candidates is speaking; turning on vol when it's the others turn. #debatenight #debates #Debates2016 #DebateNight
Donald Trump reminds me of the guy trying to get into the club dropping names of people he knows and or is "cool " with #Debates
@realDonaldTrump's jab at @HillaryClinton with commercial comment. I wonder how the media will address that. #debatenight #debatenight
No, murders are down pretty much everywhere nationwide, with a SLIGHT rise in a few cities this year. #debatenight #factcheck
Because random fatshaming in the middle of his rant makes his argument more compelling? #debates
Why tf you lyin Why you always lyin Mmmmm oh my God Stop frikin lyin   @realDonaldTrump #debatenight
"Mainstream media nonsense put out by her." -@RealDonaldTrump on his support of the Iraq war #debatenight
lol Trump's like a 6 year old.  'YEW STAYED HOME CUZ YEW WERE SICK'  #debatenight
&amp; speak TF UP Lester , stop letting them OVER talk you #Debates
.@realDonaldTrump's very unique syntax is making this a brutal debate to watch. #debatenight WHAT THE HELL IS HE TALKING ABOUT?!
Trump had so many opportunities to attack Hilary. Now is the time to use your mouth Donald! Take advantage of the opportunity #debates
They got jokes tonight. Thought I was watching a Roast on Comedy Central for a sec. #debatenight
Just because you're friends with Omarosa doesn't mean you're friendly with the black community #debates
Trump has also subtly admitted to not paying taxes and supporting the housing market crash 😂 #debatenight
I was just endorsed. Like just right now. So you wouldn't know about it. I'm not lying - Trump #debatenight
When asked his steps to fix race relations. He kept saying "Law and Order" over again. Which episode are you talking about?# #debates
"I also prepared to be president. And that's a good thing." - @HillaryClinton. I'M SO WITH HER IT HURTS. #Debates2016 #ImWithHer 🇺🇸
#hillary's smartest move is to be quiet and allow him to talk himself out of this debate. #debates #Debates2016 #debatenight #
Are there fact checkers right now? Their heads must be spinning. #Debates
"Whew, OK!" is going to be my new rallying cry and ringtone #Debates2016
Trump is so delusional and I don't give a damn about Obama or the Black community smh... #Debates
Damn right! If you can't fly then you shouldn't be able to buy a gun. #debates #MSNBC
Talking about Iran... What would it take for a candidate to mention STUXNET? They stopped because we cyberattacked them #Debates2016
Oh lord help us all if she gets elected America is doomed. Trump/Pence 2016 #Debates
Can you use the fact you have an elitist club that allowed some non-white people in to prove you aren't racist? #Debates2016
I couldnt be the 1 askin questions 2 these 2 idiots I would sass them &amp; tell them 2 shut the hell up &amp; let me get my question out #debates
@HRClinton That's a problem with the IRS tax code, not @realDonaldTrump issue for following the rules! #releasethe33 #Debates2016
We've spent a lot more time talking about Trump negatives; Tax returns and birtherism. Not good for him #debatenight
#debatenight #DonaldTrump not the 1 that did eulogy 4 KKK leader Robert Byrd #HillaryClinton did
Hillary backed Trump into defending his own record instead of attacking her 30 years of what should be career ending scandals #debatenight
As a lower middle class citizen Trumps economic policies scare me #debatenight
He's talking about "law and order" as if these cops are carrying out the law by killing unarmed black folks #debatenight
"I hope the fact-checkers are turning up the volume. Donald Trump supported the invasion of Iraq." #debatenight #debates go @HillaryClinton!
If our current President didn't degrade our police forces... they might not be scared to do their jobs... #DebateNight
#debatenight As far as body language goes she's collected, confident... He seems not to break down in anger, seething... Ha, good show.
And there it is the attack on mainsteam media took him long enough !! #Debates2016
He's got his 3AM drunk guy making a point, just lemme make this point, style on #debatenight
"I take advantage of the laws of the nation" - Donald Trump #Debates2016
Trump: " You walk on the street and you get shot"   Trump: " I can walk on the street and shot someone "   #debates #Debates2016 #CNN
Literally crying because I have to watch this foolery for a grade in government 😢😢 #debatenight 😔
I have so much respect for Secretary Clinton for maintaining her composure during this debate #DebateNight
I can't turn it off but I want to turn it off...it has to end soon right? #Trumpisatremendousdumbdumb #debatenight
If you're playing a drinking game, take a shot for e-mails. 🍸🍺🍻 #debatenight #Debates2016
Did HRC say The Don "stiffed" a lot of little guys when he built his businesses? #Debates2016
Trump: Best member of her team is the Main Stream Media #debates #debatenight #HillaryLies
trump is not even on the topic of race ..  he is just rambling about a lot of shit &amp; is sounds so stupid . #debatenight
Donald Trump does not care about the American people. He only cares about the property he owns around the country. #DebateNight
@bimmerella the tax returns show that the emporer is naked. And he has a tiny penis and it's not cold out. #debatenight
@ComfortablySmug He didn't propose a solution to the chicago gang violence issue. He talked for over a minute on it. #debatenight
Hillary may not have started the birther movement but her supporters helped egg it on. #Debates2016
@realDonaldTrump @HillaryClinton come on ref, break up the brawl.  We want a debate not a shouting match. @LesterHoltNBC  #Debates2016
I bought sonic 06 and hated it but I still payed for it #debates
Sec. Clinton's composure tonight could've taught me how to keep my last job when I faced off against a bully but crossed a line #debatenight
"and I'm prepared to be President, and I think that's a good thing."  - @HillaryClinton #ImWithHer #debates #MicDrop
I miss the idea of Bernie Sanders as a president, which candidate is the lesser evil? #debatenight
Mr. Holt, I'm gonna need you get control and have them stick to the question and minutes. #Debates2016
The J in Donald J Trump stands for Jidontwantobepresidenthelpme.  His full name is Donald Jidontwantobepresidenthelpme Trump.  #Debates2016
The J in Donald J Trump stands for Jnobodylikesthesejokes.  His full name is Donald Jnobodylikesthesejokes Trump.  #Debates2016
Someone please ask DT what FED stands for. I want to hear him try to spell that out... #debatenight
@Carlos_Adama One of the reasons I wanted to skip the debates this year is because I hate the faces he makes. But here I am watching anyway.
YOU ARE ON VIDEO SUPPORTING THE WAR, WHY DOES HE LIES ALL TIMES? #DEBATES
I love when men tell me I'm wrong and cut me off when I'm speaking. LOVE IT.   A lesson, everyone. I speak fluent sarcasm. #DebateNight
"we have to take the guns away from these people, these are bad people!" -- if he's talking about the NRA, we finally agree! #debatenight
@HillaryClinton no one can meet the people you've harmed because they are dead #debatenight
Race relations by @HillaryClinton who LOVES eugenicist racist Margaret Sanger  #debatenight Clinton plan? keep killing blacks in the womb
Why isn't Trump bringing up Clinton foundation? Benghazi? #ClintonCash Haitian donations? @ppact eugenics supported by Killary? #debatenight
Lmao the debates started like what ten minutes ago or some shit like that and my mom is already shouting at the TV because of Trump 😹😹😹
His favorite two words are "believe me." Psychologists know that you can't believe someone who repeats "believe me" incessantly. #debates
Time to talk about race? Trump should act like his mic is broken.. don't even try it..#DebateNight
Notice how @realDonaldTrump is just complaining about things but not proposing solutions #debatenight
We do not "lose on everything" - or perhaps I just think more of #america and its role in the world #deterrence #debatenight
"Stop &amp; Frisk worked very well" - WHAT THE ACTUAL FUCK, Trump?!?!? #debates #debates2016
"I'm prepared to be president, and I think that's a good thing."-@HillaryClinton  AMAZING. #ImWithHer #debates #debates2016
Everyone is live-tweeting #DebateNight, but mom and I are over here discussing the insane sexual tension in Mr. and Mrs. Smith airing on FX.
Agree. Everyone has implicit bias. Like Hillary says, police use of deadly force procedure needs to be addressed. Definitely. #debatenight
I think Trump might have stomped his feet when he howled about having a better temperament than Clinton 😂 #debates
Take the heat off of his ta returns &amp; put it on these damn emails. It's old and a nonfactor at this point. #debatenight
"He needed to release his birth certificate." Like you need to release your tax returns...? #debatenight
Trump came dangerously close to saying #TakeBackControl there. It's #EUref all over again #debatenight
Trump: I think NATO are a shit show, but they should do as I say anyway.  #debatenight
Donald's tax payments would make La Guardia great again, I bet. #debates
You got him to produce his birth certificate. Now get yourself to produce your tax returns. #debatenight
I make up words like braggadocious when I'm all coked up too. #DonaldTrump #debatenight #braggadocious #Election2016 🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸
My rich, yacht-owning fiancé has actually BEEN to "third world countries" and knows how privileged we Americans are. Bae. #debatenight
All @realDonaldTrump seems to keep repeating to me is "China and Mexico". #Debates2016 #PresidentialDebate @CNN
@HillaryClinton not coming to play with y'all tonight. She semi pulled out the #blacklivesmatter card! 🙌🏾 #Debates2016 #PresidentialDebate
"I think you'll agree cause I said it to you once"-Donald trump. That is not modified. #debates
Okay, I'm calling it now. No more than 25 minutes until EITHER candidate starts throwing around curse words.  #debatenight
Trump seems to forget that Republicans are the majority and so far more to blame for what is or isn't happening right now #Debates2016
Trumps response has nothing to do with the question at hand dealing with race relations in America #debatenight
WTF?! #Trump: "Someone sitting on their bed who weighs 400 lbs".  #HofDebate16 #debatenight
Just listening Donald Trump every time he talks makes me cringe a little inside #debatenight
what's really disengaging about this debate is Trump inability to state  resources and accurate numbers #debatenight
We're being ripped off by every single country in the world? @realDonaldTrump Someone fire our accountant... #comedy #LIES #debatenight
"in your president things..." @realDonaldTrump I sure hope you represent us on a global level. #sarcasm #debates #comedy
Tell me again how having @GovGaryJohnson in the #Debates2016  would have been a bad idea? All these two are doing is attacking one another
You learn a lot about people from tax returns, you ag of dicks. #Debates2016
"Believe me, I know a thing or 10,000 about saying terrible things." #Debates2016
"Now wait a minute, I'm the only one that's allowed to interrupt!" #Debates2016
I like a candidate that can own their mistakes &amp; do better the next time. I wonder if both candidates could own their mistakes...  #Debates
Hey @realDonaldTrump The U.S. went from the No.1 CREDITOR nation in the world to the No.1 DEBTOR nation under 8 yrs of Reagan! #Debates2016
@LesterHoltNBC has no fucking balls whatsoever!  What a fucking joke!! Keep the control for Christ's sake!!!  Impose yourself! #Debates2016
You can't just steal peoples oil btw, that's called a war crime. #debates
Hillary is keeping her cool and it keeps Pissing Trump off. Show your tax returns @realDonaldTrump #debatenight
It's either hillary's fault or obama's fault because apparently we are a part of a monarchy #debatenight
“@chrismanderson: Cant wait to hear accurate assessment of Donald Trump's troop wishes. #debatenight” facts are just words Chris- ya'know..
Is he fit for office? it seems #trump has the sniffles.  #snifflegate #debatenight
but like you can release your taxes when you're being audited unless you're hiding something from the IRS, na? #debatenight
My mind can't begin to comprehend how Trump has got so far in this election #Debates2016
I don't support Hillary, but she's wiping the floor with trump right now #Debates2016
None of what he is saying right now is true. None of it. #FantasyLand #ImWithHer #debatenight
So we all agree they did not talk about race tonight!! Butchered Blackness. Barely mentioned Hispanics. Asians non-existent. #debatenight
Clinton says Trump supported Iraq war and the actions taken in Libya #debatenight
Hillary has the audacity to say Donald has something to hide when she deleted 33,000 emails.....#votefortrump  #Debates2016
#debatenight  #Trump is showing just what a fool he is. "I have an unbelievable company" It's unbelievable alright. It's a fraud #Debate2016
Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump could just be holograms spitting out their old tweets and it would still be the same debate #DebateNight
"Yeah you know what else I prepared for? Being President of the United States." AWWWW SNAAAPP QUEEN!! #DebateNight
Why does he talk about other stuff that does not relate to questions asked? Not prepared lmao, they both suck #Debates
Trum doesn't know anything about cybersecurity. It's obvious. He's just winging it. #debatenight
Goes to show that he constantly feels the need to defend himself because he knows he's full of shit #debates
#HillaryClinton is needling at him and its so obvious he doesn't like being talked to like that by a lowly female #DebateNight
This debate is silliness. Clinton is a robot politician, predictable &amp; same old talking points. Trump is erratic #Debates2016 #HofDebate16
It must be so hard to keep talking when in your mind you are falling down a steep hill. #DebateNight
SOMEBODY needs to photoshop these guys into Cleveland CAVALIERS uniforms hahahahaha get it? Cavalier? #Debates2016
Did Trump just pat himself on the back for not excluding black people from his Palm Beach club? #debatenight
Yes Hillary on gun control; if you're too dangerous too fly you're too dangerous to buy #debatenight
Young Americans should commit crimes and they won't end up in jail. #debatenight
Donald did a good job "disrespecting our President", not answering the question #debatenight
Clear contrast between Trump &amp; Clinton on economics: top down vs middle out. Clear choice in this election #PresidentialDebate #debatenight
DJ Drumpf is really using this to plug all his properties, isn't he? #debates
I believe Donald Trump when he says it's very easy to rip America off, because I feel like I'm watching him do it in real time #Debates2016
My thoughts and prayers go out to the fact checkers right now #debatenight #debates
"We have become a third world country" okay Trump calm down  #Debates
@pattonoswalt @occultauralist I'm more nervous for this than watching my favorite sports ball team. Debate harder #debatenight
On tax returns: "I filed a 104 page, essentially financial statement of sorts . . .it shows income . . .at $694m." #Debates2016 #debatenight
@tmilliner1 it's a weight question w/no answer...just like the race question given them...😜 #debates #Decision2016 #debatenight
Donald Trump doesn't even have the decency to let this man finish his questions smh #debatenight
Part of the first generation of African-Americans born with the right and ALSO ALLOWED to vote in the United States of America #Debates2016
The "Breathe" alarm is going insane on my AppleWatch while I watch. #notenoughmeditationintheworld #Debates2016
Ok but "Trumped Up Trickle Down" is definitely something Dan Egan would come up with for Selina Meyer on Veep. #debatenight
Trump's only yelling over Hillary because he's literally never had to listen to a woman this long in his life. #debatenight
Did Trump start to say I've been endorsed by ICE.. when he was talking about ISIS? He is starting to lose it.. #debatenight
Lester is doing a terrible job at keeping Trump on topic. #debatenight
Watching this debate, I am convinced 11/8/16 is the scariest day in our history #Debates2016 #thirdvoiceplease #JohnsonWeld2016
“It’s a way of life to get audited by the IRS?” Must be two ways of life. #debatenight
Great, Trump said we're in a bubble and that the stock market is going to crash. Now Wall Street will freak out and make it happen #debates
Trump wants to take the guns away from people... Black people it sounds like... How will that work for him #debatenight #debates
"You don't learn that much from tax returns"... um, except the actual truth about your fucking finances #debatenight
Donald's fat-phobia just reared its ugly head as he envisions a hacker "who weighs four hundred pounds." #ImWithHer #Debates2016
We are getting into temperament when we are supposed to be talking about national security and global terrorism? God help us all. #debates
If you can build a post office hotel, you can run a country #Debates2016
The way he just interrupts and cuts her off is so gross, undecided women are watching! #DebateNight
500 murders in 8000000+ is .006%. Yeah that's actually pretty good. #debatenight
The sniffing of @realDonaldTrump is the sound a dementor makes when it steals your soul. #debates #debatenight #sniffofdeath
Ah yes, take time to advocate for China invading North Korea. What is happening. #Debates2016
I'm reminded of the guy in "Office Space" who was "good with people, dammit!" He wouldn't have been a good President, either. #debatenight
Had to double check my TV guide cuz I thought this was an episode of looney toons #Debates
"We have to bring back law and order. I'm talking Criminal Intent. I'm talking SVU. I'm talking the one wth Ice T." #debatenight
"We should not have profit motivation to fill prison cells" - HRC #debatenight
@Bethenny @realDonaldTrump He came coked up and ready to patronize her. I wish a fact-checker ran across the bottom. #debatenight

If anyone has Sean Hannity's #... Give it to my mom. Wait, don't. My dad will be super upset. #Debates2016
He Es sued by the justice department for racial bias against African Americans... #debatenight  #debates
Crooked Hillary could not protect classified information, and now she wants to be promoted to POTUS! #Never Crooked Hillary Clinton #Debates
This debate is like sitting in a room of preteens where you're not real sure anybody knows what they're talking about. #debatenight
How does the decline in violent crime fit your narrative of the "gun epidemic" Madam Secretary? #tlot #debatenight #PresidentialDebate
Dear progressives- Here it is, racist stop &amp; frisk is a gun control measure #PresidentialDebate #debatenight #tlot
I'm glad Hillary woke up 30 years later. Go back to sleep, girl. #Debates2016
He calls people names every day- he brings up one comment said 20 years ago? #outofhisleague #debatenight
Mr. Trump Elvis always took standard deduction didn't itemize bc he loved his country! #debatenight
"We have to take these guns away" was not said by @HillaryClinton y'all. #debatenight
NYC's murder rate in the first 1/4th of 2016 (during Mayor de Blasio's term) dropped 21 percent from the year before. #debates #Debates2016
The released BHO birth certificate was a FAKE according to forensic analysis.   Why not release real Hawaii one?    #Debates2016 #Debates
@AnnCoulter And then #CrookedHillary gave Putin a Uranium deal - +20% of USA Uranium. #Debates2016 #ClintonCash
#CrookedHillary went from Cocaine Con-Air in Mena Arkansas to Arms Trade to enemy states and ISIS. Ask Chris Stevens.  #Debates2016 #Debates
He's got no substance so he's name dropping Ferguson? That's low. 😡 #debatenight
Trump debate formula: blame others and talk about himself. Every topic is about him, him, him. #narcissism #debatenight
I have a better temperament than Hillary.. and then the crowd burst into laughter...buhahaha..  #Debates
YES HILLARY. YES TO ALL OF WHAT IS HAPPENING. #debatenight not paying taxes makes me smart" wow.
You can't just not pay your taxes. It doesn't "make you smart" #debatenight
It's getting #braggadocious up in here. To be #semiexact. Yes I did that #purposely #debatenight
Hillary just str8 up fried Trump's ass over his tax returns. LET EM KNOW YOU IN THE HOUSE GIRL #debatenight #Debates2016
Did anyone add, “friends” to their BINGO list? I mist that one. #debatenight
wait…Trump just said stop and frisk was not deemed unconstitutional….where are the fact checkers? #debatenight
Trump not answering question on why it took him so long to accept that Pres.Obama was born in USA. Lester has asked 3 times now #debatenight
All these tweets are funny and all, but one of these two are about to be our president. This is terrifying. #debatenight
"And you can go look it up and check it out" #debatenight  also, let Donald know what you find cuz he has no idea.
.@hillaryclinton -preaching word 4 word Soros criminal justice reform that eliminates private prison &amp; skips jail 4 criminals! #DebateNight
Bernie Sanders was taken advantage of by your people, says #Trump on the hacking issue! #Debates2016 #Debates Boom
Ok, based on their facial expressions alone, who is winning this debate? #debatenight
This is not a debate. @HillaryClinton is taking the other candidate to school. #debatenight #debates
Who do you agree with on the issue of war with foreign enemies? #debatenight #HillaryClinton #DonaldTrump
That's the way uh huh uh huh I like it uh huh uh huh @realDonaldTrump ...... asshole  #Debates
Lester is about to walk out ,  like " fuck this shit" #Debates
"Bragadocious." DON'T DRINK, JUST KEEP SITTING THERE WITH YOUR MOUTHS AGAPE. #debatenight
Speaking of "they're not paying us what they should be paying us" don't you owe some people Trump?  #debates
Soooo still not puttin the Obama birther thing to bed, huh?? #debatenight
How does Trump talk about Hilary's treatment of POTUS in past debates when he can't keep his mouth shut right. now.???
"As far as 'the nuclear' is concerned.." Well uhh, excellent.  #Debates
@realDonaldTrump MIC DROP! You are the next president of the United States🇺🇸. #Debates2016 #LOVEHATEMYGEMINITWIN#Truth#controluroffspring😉🇺🇸
Again .... Hillary did NOT come to play with this hoe tonight! #DebateNIght
If I had a dime for every time Trump said "you're wrong." in this debate I would have enough money for my college education. #debates
Hmmmm - I don't think touting that you made $694 million last year is gonna help you. #debatenight
how did I know trump was going to bring up super predators #debatenight
lester holt seems to be biased towards Hilary when asking follow up questions #debatenight
I am not watching or paying any attention to anything related to the debates.
.@realDonaldTrump is gambling on not preparing for the debate &amp; speaking from his heart... so is @HillaryClinton... 😉 #Debates2016
Hillary's plan to protect USA on defeating hackers: "Delete Your Emails. It worked for Me" #debatenight #Debates2016 #Debates #emails
RT EliLake: And Trump saying, “nuclear is the greatest threat” is exactly what Obama has been saying for 8 years. #debatenight
"I have a winning temperament!"  What in the hell does that mean anyway?! #DebateNight
This is a pretty great Hannity rant. I have no idea what it's about, but it's entertaining. #debatenight
Not to #DonaldTrump, talking about crime in Black &amp; Latino communities is not the same as talking about race #debatenight
Is he just going to scream this entire time? Because I can't. #debatenight
Trump wants America to make Japan &amp; other countries pay us protection money like a small business to a mob boss #debatenight
Hillary using her hands now. Reaches heavenward. Shows flash of exasperation. Now trying to look serious as he talks. Failing. #Debates2016
Our current president is not in the fault of the shootings #debatenight
Did @realDonaldTrump spend the day snorting coke??  'Cause that would explain a lot of this, including all the sniffing....  #debatenight
...back when trump was a poor young boy on the streets of Charlotte #DebateNight
You keep talking about what you said not what you're gonna do idiot #debates
Hillary Clinton is so well-versed on the issues. A true leader. @TheBriefing2016 #debates2016
#debatenight  BOOM.. Trump on the gang problem The police are afraid to do anything
Ha - he's never going to release his tax returns - EVER #debatenight
... ICE is a administrative body... They can't endorse a candidate? #Debates2016
And now Hilary has to moderate the conversation too?  Lester, step up your game... #debatenight
Wow didn't know Hillary had a copy of trumps tax returns  #debatenight
#debatenight Trump: you don't learn a lot from tax returns.  So I am saving Americans from mine. You're welcome.
This segment is about racial healing so let me bring up the birther issue? Really? #debatenight
Trump: "I have a winning temperament."  Lester Holt: "Ok. Let me "  Trump: "HOLD THE FUCK OFF, LESTER! I WANT TO CONTINUE!!"  #debates
Does he seem to be rethinking his "facts" because he realizes there will be fact-checking? #debatenight
Any person who calls #Stop&amp;Frisk a success in NYC is truly unworthy of the title POTUS! #debatenight #PresidentialDebate
Donald picked up an 8th grade economics book and read the index #DebateNight #uscgoingviral
"Everyone should be respected by the law, &amp; everyone should respect the law" Clinton on US race relations #Debates #debatenight
WHY TRUMP SHAKING HIS HEAD WHILE HILARY TALKING ABOUT BLACK PROBLEMS???? PENDEJO #debatenight
the fact that this is an argument over relations between officers and minority groups is really troubling me. #OccupyTheDebates #debatenight
Hillary say we need gun........ safety measures. Almost said gun control #debatenight
Trump: "A big, fat, ugly bubble." Good subliminal reference to Hillary. #debatenight
According to Trump, everything; even government is a business deal and money comes first. #debatenight
@realDonaldTrump YOU SAY NOTHING THAT YOU ARE A RACIST BITCH TO THW PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES #debatenight
TEMPERAMENT??!! BITCH I STUDY DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY YOU DO NOT HAVE A GOOD TEMPERAMENT #debatenight #LoserDonald
either 1) this is a massive clever prank by my handful of twitter friends, or 2) I should go watch the debates with a bottle of cheap vodka.
YES!!! Mental health is a big police problem. Finally talking about this. #debatenight
Watched Brian Hoyer QB the Bears last night. What we have is the political version of Brian Hoyer QBing both parties. #DebateNight
It's like two little kids going back and forth saying "uh uh she/he did it first" #debatenight
Wow! The "super predator" move! Good call Trump! How will HRC answer that?! #debatenight
"I say nothing" perfectly summarizes everything that comes out Donald Trumps mouth. #tytlive #debatenight
@BernieSanders Why did you drop out? This #debatenight is painful and a sad reality of what a long 4 years this country has in store.
Trump must really like the TV show Law &amp; Order since he wants to bring it back. #debatenight
.@HillaryClinton is nailing this #debatenight &amp; @realDonaldTrump is acting like a petulant child throwing a #trumpertantrum
Clinton calls Trump out for "bait &amp; switch", saying historically for years candidates have released returns. #debatenight #Debates2016
Trump gives descriptions of problems not solution! And to blow off the racial question  he is for the White Nationalist!  #Debates
Four times the audience has cheered or otherwise responded in a supportive manner that @LesterHoltNBC has failed to admonish #debatenight
Was walking out the room and I heard the word race and ran back in. #debatenight
"You know what else I prepared for? To be President" -Hillary Clinton. And I will help you. #debatenight
"I have a much better temperament than she does." Mic drop.  Literally laugh out loud unreal. #debatenight
Shorter Hillary: Hey moron, I 'aint apologizing for being smarter and better prepared than you #Debates2016
And yet Clinton hasn't said one word during this negative trump rant! #Debates
@LesterHoltNBC Make him stop!  He's walking all over you!  Don't let him get away with this!  #PresidentialDebate #debatenight
Trump, touting illegal stop &amp; frisk, claims that only minorities live in our inner cities. #debatenight #Trump
No matter what either of the candidates say, fans will support their fav and believe they won the debate. #debatenight
Trump is just trying to win a contest, Hillary is trying to become president #Debates
There she goes Oops I made a mistake with my sever in my basement. Sorry. In reality she knew exactly what she was doing #debateNight #Trump
🚨 IT HAS BEEN PROVEN THAT STOP AND FRISK DOESNT WORK🚨 #DebateNight
"That makes me smart." Donald Trump on not paying any federal taxes. I guess paying our share of taxes is for us losers. #debatenight
Birther? #debatenight Lester pressing it. #rudetrump acting as if he didn't ride the issue
Trump just advocated for China to start a war with North Korea. Brilliant foreign policy. #debates #debatenight #debate2016
Clinton: Trump is bad because of asking Russia to hack US emails Trump's rebuttal: A BUNCH OF PEOPLE JUST ENDORSED ME #debatenight
@LesterHoltNBC take more control of time in these debates or the rants go on and on
Stop 👏🏻 interrupting 👏🏻 her 👏🏻She 👏🏻 lets 👏🏻 you 👏🏻speak 👏🏻#Debates
#debatenight even a Presidential debate is turned into a #Trump commercial...can you say #ConflictOfInterest
Hillary just botch slapped Trump on his taxes and his interjection just made it worse. #debatenight
What does that mean Trump "be prepared?" A nuclear arms race. SMH. #debatenight
Trump just tacitly admitted to not paying federal taxes by saying if he did, it might have been wasted. #DebateNight See eh, America is mad.
Cool @realDonaldTrump now that you've been cornered you want to move over to other topics #debatenight
Bangalore and Saigon have way better airports than anything in the US #debatenight
I love that he said he had a better temperament than her and everyone laughed. at him, not with him. welcome to the real world. #debatenight
How Hilary stops herself from rolling her eyes is beyond me #debatenight  #debates #Debates2016
Release the audits when she releases the emails. Awesome. Thank you! #debates
The violence is from Reagan era policies on drugs. Undecided millennial for Bernie on @realDonaldTrump rant on gun violence #debatenight
We have a presidential candidate proposing something already ruled unconstitutional. Healing the racial divide with racism. #debatenight
Trump is so full of shit even he can't stop smelling it #SniffingTrump #debates
HRC pointing out that GWBush signed agreement with Iraq - a sovereign nation - that required withdrawal of troops. #Debates2016
Trump fans need to tell their boy to be quiet RIGHT NOW. Worst moment for him so far. #stopandfrisk #Debates2016
Let's all take a moment to thank @twitter for its existence. Pretty great on here tonight. #DebateNight #Debates2016 #TrumpVsClinton
He is really thinking stop &amp; frisk is going to work 🙄 #Debates2016
Can we all just take a moment to appreciate how sexy @LesterHoltNBC voice is? #Debates2016 #debatenight
I'm only here for the comedy tweets. And there's lots of good ones. #debatenight
319 million people, and THESE are my choices? For the first time in my life, I'm genuinely embarrassed to be an American. #debates
Before this debate I was ready to support Hill because of Trump.  But now I supoort Hill for Hill. #debatenight #imwithher #BelieveMe
"My Da would kill your Da!" Trump shockingly shouts at Hillary! #debatenight #debates #Debates2016
Trump, what do you and your attorneys have to hide?  #debatenight
so it looks like Hilary's method is to not play his game and let Trump spaz out. #debatenight
"GET GUNS OUT OF THE PEOPLE'S HANDS THAT SHOULD NOT HAVE THEM"🙌🏾🙌🏾 preach Hillary!  #debatenight
"We'll get to Pennsylvania Ave." What do I need to role to get there? #Debates2016 #Monopoly
I think Donald did a few white lines b4 coming out to debate. If he snorts one more time...ewe. *snort #debatenight #debates #Debates2016
Tonight in a nutshell DT: Let me respond LH:okay DT: *goes on a tangent without responding #debatenight #ENTP040
Husband says, "She's not a successor, she's a fulfailure" Bravo husband 😂 #debatenight
Trump in full stream of consciousness mode at debate making no sense at all.  He's not going to make it.   #debatenight
When asked about healing racial divides, Trump responds with "I say nothing."  #debatenight
You heard it here first, if Trump doesn't become president, he is gonna become the White House mailman #Debates2016 #DebateNight
Am I the only one who heard Trump almost mention he is endorsed by ISIS? Or am I overthinking things a little bit. #Debates2016 #debatenight
Listenin to Trump talk and I cant help think #Mabreezy is one of his advisors #Debates2016
I feel sorry for the american people.. Trump and Clinton are both trash #debatenight
Apparently ISIS has been around since the civil rights movement according to the Donald #whoknew #debatenight
I didn't know hell was a fully furnished two bedroom apt in Charleston, SC. #debates #DebateNight #TrumpKnowsBlacks
#debatenight @realDonaldTrump YOU DONT OWN ANY OF THESE GREAT "STRUCTURES" COWARD. You have land leases, big difference. Look it up.
Hush, #Trump! Let it be fair.. I would like to hear both sides clearly and uninterrupted #debatenight
$650 million dollars is "not a lot of money". The Donald there, appealing to working-class voters. #debatenight #debates
Here the question I wanted to hear the answers to. Race Relations. #debatenight
Trump: We need to take guns AWAY from bad people. That's a loaded thing to say on a Republican ticket. #olivetsocial #Debates2016
More and more I feel like I'm living in the movie #Idiocracy. Nothing Trump says has any legitimacy. He's as bad as a WWF actor #debatenight
These are the least ambiguous "maybe"s ever spoken in a debate. #debatenight
Trump is a good debater, provided you subscribe to his version of reality. Sounds like a lunatic to logical people #debatenight
Trump just said not paying taxes makes him smart...#debatenight This is who yall want to run this country?
Oh my god orange human, shut up during her two minutes. #debatenight
Ok seriously yall! What in he entire hell is he talking about?! SERIOUSLY #Debates2016
Lmao @CPTBobby: #debatenight So my choice is between a Raving Lunatic and a Chronic lier. Awesome thanks #Democracy
Okay you say you never settle, but you just said you settled a lawsuit so which is it? #debatenight
I can't wait for the mashup video of Donald inhaling through his nostrils. #debatenight #TrumpVsClinton
i love being six feet under a thick layer of smirking racist slime watching this debate #Debates
Got him to produce the birth certificate and I did a good job. He should have produced it a long time ago.  Un-doggone-believable. #debates
What if Trump and Hillary actually talked about real U.S problems instead of just themselves  #Debates
Trump will constantly be hurt by his inability to control his words now and in the past. #Debatenight #imwithher
Stop and frisk is unconstitutional Stop and frisk is unconstitutional Stop and frisk is unconstitutional #debatenight
Having the American public pay for his failed businesses, "Makes him smart." #debatenight #debates #Debates2016
The @GOP has been saying, "We've lost control over things we had control over." this whole time! @KagroX @DemFromCT #debatenight #debates
I can't watch this train wreck, but I can't look away either. Are the nominees even taking about the same thing? #debatenight
Seems like a lot of real estate companies are openly racist. #debatenight
I mean, that would be standard opposition research. Probably nothing to do with birtherism. #debatenight
The Looks on trumps mug are priceless! Liar,written all over it. Lmfao #debatenight
Imagine if you could have a second for #debatenight. Trump would turn up and be hammered by Obama due to Hillary's resurgent pneumonia.
The infamous Audit has plagued the orange man's campaign for months. For 15 years the orange man has had to carry this burden #Debates2016
Trying to follow @realDonaldTrump logic is seriously like screwing for virginity. It just doesn't work. #Debates2016 #PresidentialDebate
Hillary is gonna make a meal out of the "race card." #debatenight
Trump screaming about lousy 3rd world infrastructure...fails to understand republicans control House &amp; Senate &amp; have since 2012 #debatenight
Trump just said "Terra!" like LL Cool J near the end of "Momma Said Knock You Out" #debatenight
"I haven't given much of thought to..." *insert anything Donald Trump has ever said* #debatenight
As opposed to going to the golf course to hunt octopus.  #Debates2016 #debates #debatenight #thanksobama
If Trump graduated from Trump University, that would explain a lot.  #Debates2016 #debates #debatenight
hillary trying not to laugh at donalds stupidity is actually me #Debates
#Trump "We should have taken the #Oil " Maybe he should have taken the #Nyquil &amp; #Kleenex What's up with all that sniffling? #debatenight
Let's see  #debatenight Ice, police  union , nra......Donald  has nothing  for me.
#debatenight is Donald  saying  we should  occupy  a sovereign  nation  and still the resources ?
I delete emails all the time. But I don't hide my tax returns.#debatenight
Hillary: "You don't pay your fair share. You pay no federal taxes."  #Debates2016
Ooh snap. Let's see if @realDonaldTrump can remember how his #birther conspiracy goes. #Debates2016
#Debates #debatenight CJ reform. The nature of police and the entire system needs to be overhauled. Stop militarization of police.
#Debates Trump supporting Stop &amp; Frisk. Not shocked at all. He wants more force. More Governmental power. More statism.
I swear Trump should change his presidential slogan to "Believe Me" lmao 😆 #debates
I'm praying for anyone who agreed to a drinking game based around Donald's hyperbole #debatenight
How come when it's a candidate's turn to answer, the sound guy doesn't just mute the other person's microphone? #DebateNight
Holt now asking Trump about his insistence on peddling the 'birther' movement, still lays it at the then-Clinton campaign #debatenight
Clinton says Trump started his political career on the 'racist' birther movement #debatenight
Somehow we combined Trump's national security talk and his protectionism talk and got to the economic 'behemoth' Japan #debatenight
Obama didn't take us IN to Iraq! Also, you can't just go stealing other country's resources, you tit! #debatenight
America we've been in a relationship for 227 years , how about we just be a thot for a couple years ? #debatenight
So he just admitted that he's a major proponent of outsourcing. #Debates2016
I can't believe how candid @realDonaldTrump is being about "working" the system...loopholes, no taxes, bankruptcy and MORE! #debatenight
#debatenight #Trump lecturing a woman who has known ISIS all her adult life about the creation of ISIS...sheesh
"Law &amp; Order. We need #stopandfrisk." WOOOOW. Trump just lost ALL of the #blackvote #debatenight
"I have much better judgement than she has and a much better temperament," #Trump screams from his timeout #Debates2016
#debatenight is on. Two people are currently watching my content instead. I'm not gonna tell them to switch.
When the Secretary talks, it's like an episode of MST3000 during the writer's strike. #Debates2016
Is Arnold Palmer is looking down &amp; smiling right now thinking this isn't my problem #Debates2016 #WeAreScrewed
Hillary starting to wobble...or her Depends are crawling up her ass.   #debatenight  #Debates2016 #debates
I'm sorry but Lester Holt hasn't been a very good moderator. #debatenight
"You're perfectly free to release your taxes during an audit. Does the public have a right to know your person?" um yes.  #debatenight
Well, she ain't wrong about that. Gotta pay the people who do the work.... #Debates
Do you not learn that much from tax returns though? You'd learn a lot from mine. #debatenight
Holy fuck is @realDonaldTrump trying to debate stop and frisk as constitutional? This is a thing that's happening? #debatenight #drinkmore
Is he blaming Clinton for the creation of ISIS right now? #debatenight
Nuclear weapons? Trump you had to ask a political advisor THREE TIMES in ONE sitting why we can't just USE nuclear weapons #debatenight
hillary is done with this debate. she doesnt have the time #debates
He said he's got better judgement and a "winning temperament". ,:-. #DebateNight
can't believe donald trump has got where he is in the presidential campaign, it's as if it was a bam up that's went too far 😂 #debatenight
“You’re perfectly free to release your taxes during an audit”  Yes well done. #Debates2016 #Decision2016 #HofDebate16
Is @realDonaldTrump on coke? Why does he keep sniffling and acting so temperamental? #PresidentialDebate #Debates2016
What was Hillary hiding in all those emails she deleted!!!   #debatenight
Trump losing his temper on temperament - I can taste the irony #Debates2016
Trump doesn't understand how SOFAs work. We had to leave Iraq or troops and contractors would be liable. #debatenight
If this debate has convinced me of anything, it's that @realDonaldTrump furiously, and actively hates America. #debatenight
"We have become a third world country" - Trump.  Yes, let's hurry up and build airports trimmed with gold and T logos. #debatenight
Honestly at a loss for words. How have we allowed this orangutan on stage? How is this orangutan the nominee of the GOP? #Debates2016
Trumps breathing is horrible. Did he do some blow before he got up there? #debatenight #MomSaysGoBlowYourNose
Trump is making faces somebody give him a TIME OUT lol #debatenight #TrumpSucks #ImWithHer #VoteHilaryClinton #Debates
As far as cyber security is concerned I'm pretty sure Hillary knows more than the Dump..love her just saying lol  #debatenight
#Hillary 2 many military style weapons on the street? Read the Federalist Papers &amp; learn y we need guns - 2 protect from govt #debatenight
"Your dad was a dishwasher? Why am I talking to you?-Trump #debatenight
58 minutes in and there's an agreement between the candidates about no-fly, no-buy. #Debates2016
Trump's fat joke landed as well as anything so far in the room. #Debates2016
Evidently Donald wasn't told he did a "good job" often enough when he was growing up.  Now he has to do it himself. #debatenight
So only Trump can save us? ooohh now the Fed is scary bad. #Trump is melting like cheap cheese #Debates2016
Trump logic: HILLARY KILLED THE DINOSAURS!  Everyone: how do you know that? Trump: TRUST ME I KNOW! Just trust me it huge! 🙃 #debatenight
Stiffing business partners sure sounds like the kind of integrity I want in my President. #debates
"That makes me smart." &lt;-- said by a Pres. nominee while interrupting his opponent in a televised debate. #DannyLiveTweets  #DebateNight
Oh, I see. He went Nixon '68 southern strategy. His white nationalist base will be happy. #DannyLiveTweets  #DebateNight
"Believe me"  -Compulsively lying megalomaniac who happened to be nominated for the Presidency under the GOP  #debatenight #DannyLiveTweets
Hillary Clinton mentions Donald Trump was for the war in Iraq. He says "wrong". But he definitely was. #debatenight
Hillary Clinton seemed to have fun with Donald Trump's bizarre answer on Iraq #debatenight
The sad thing is that Trump's supporters probably think he's doing a great job. #DebateNight #Debates2016
"Yes, I can just name places and things and stuff all day long," detail-oriented debating brought to you by @realDonaldTrump #Debates2016
Ah. Doesn't it sound so good to hear someone speak who actually knows what they are talking abt? A much needed break #ImWithHer #debatenight
Man, he's still defending this whole stop and frisk thing, isn't he? #debatenight
@PolitiFact vs @factcheckdotorg - clearly PolitiFact are on the ball. Almost 30 minutes without @factcheckdotorg updates. #debates
Donald really doesn't like his "tremendous income" being called into question. Secretary Clinton don't know nothin' bout money #Debates2016
WHAT?!? We're the biggest and most advanced military power in the world. He's on crack-cocaine. #debatenight
Why are Trump’s audits a thing he WANTS to bring up in a debate? #debate2016 #debatenight
I can't stand when they dig at each other in debates. It comes off incredibly insecure. #blech
Interesting differences. Stop-and-frisk is considered normal in #EU. Owning guns is considered normal in #USA. #debates #debatenight
Audience makes noise 1x &amp; @lesterholtnbc admonishes @realdonaldtrump like a billegerent drunk  uncle for 35 min w/no reprimand #Debates2016
#Debates2016 #debates Next time Killary asks @realDonaldTrump a question I hope he pleads the fifth like #CrookedHillary employees
Make sure yall are doing your research and know what these candidates TRULY believe and stand for. It's honestly a lose/lose #debatenight
Donald Trump's like an eight year old. "She started it!" ignoring his 5 years of Birtherism.  #Debates2016
People who tell the truth don't have to keep saying "believe me" &amp; "its true". #Debates2016 #Therecordshowsotherwise.
@USMCBRAT2 he's getting his ass handed to him, and he can't handle it. #debatenight
Trump saying it is okay to not pay wages if boss not pleased. Wages negotiable, not guaranteed. This is anti-worker #DebateNight
Trump: This Country is a Loser but I am not, Therefore Elect me as President of the Class of Every John Hughes Bully Ever #DebateNight
I wanna see both candidates bring out their black friends, they both have a black friend right? #Debates2016
Oh and now #DonaldTrump is arguing that #stopandfrisk wasn't ruled unconstitutional. Just let him go #HillaryClinton. #debates
If you're writing a book on the fall of the USA, I hope you're watching Trump and taking notes #debatenight
.@kurteichenwald @jpublik to be fair, not sure we can rely on what Trump says, given it is not necessarily the truth...#debatenight
Remember everybody to keep up with everything that is a lie and a fact follow @PolitiFact and @factcheckdotorg for PURE FACTS #Debates2016
Oh yes. Everybody who's shot people is an immigrant. *looks at all the cops* #Debates2016
"BAD PEOPLE. YOU'RE WRONG. 3000 PEOPLE. 4000 PEOPLE. CHICAGO." -summary of the last minute of Trump's babbling #debatenight
He's going to get to Pennsylvania Ave. "one way or another"..OBSESSED MAYBE 🤔 #debatenight
Oh, dear lord, @LesterHoltNBC goes with Trump's taxes. Will he ask Hillary about her speeches? #debatenight
Does Trump really think the house and senate can be run like a business? Good luck with that #SoOff #debatenight
The main takeaway from tonight's #debates is that WE HAVE A THIRD CHOICE.
It's terrifying think that there's people out there watching this #debatenight nodding along with and cheering for @realDonaldTrump
I cannot believe that he's still touting Stop &amp; Frisk.  #Debates
If I'm watching #debatenight as an undecided Trump looks overwhelmed, unprepared, outclassed and he's not answering the questions presented.
My wife - "what the hell did he just say, was that a sentence?" #HofDebate16 #debatenight
@EwanMacKenna @lotsofolives thank god for Twitter tonight - we all need laughs on a night like tonight #Debates2016
This is turning into a barroom brawl right out of the chute.  Gonna be an intense 90 minutes! #debates
I imagine @HillaryClinton usually reserves this tone for explaining bedtime to 6 year olds, but it's 100% appropriate here too. #debatenight
Trump keeps drinking water consistently. Maybe he has hydration problems and he's clearly not as healthy as he claims he is? #debatenight
If you come out of this debate saying these candidates are equally anything. You are pure, idiotic garbage. Fuck you. #DebateNight
Say it wit yo chest, Lester!!!!  He was for the war in Iraq!!!! #DebateNight
OMG birth certificate issue? 😳 Obama's mom was a US citizen just like Ted Cruz's mom. 'Nuff said! #debates
NATO is staying out because that'll cause more issues! Learn about government before trying to run for the most powerful spot in it #debates
#HillaryClinton tells #DonaldTrump to "Join the debate by saying more crazy things" ... The gloves are off people #debatenight
Love ya Hill, but stop trying to be funny. Just talk about shit-- you're really good at it!!! #debatenight
@realDonaldTrump is that guy you don't bother even arguing with because he's so annoying. This debate is painful. #Debates2016  🙈🇺🇸😲
Find trump a map so he can get to his point #debatenight
@HillaryClinton just exposed #Trump as the empty bucket he really is. He's a big #disgrace to this country. #debate #debatenight #imwithher
Jesus everything @realDonaldTrump says is a Dodge, a lie, or an insult. #Debates2016
#Debates What about the shootings of police!  What about rioters being paid to riot?  She is blowing nothing but hot air!
@realDonaldTrump @HillaryClinton He loves Charlotte ... because of his business investments ... So, no lives matter? #Debates2016
How is this even a contest? Compare the detail, thought, understanding of one candidate vs. the utter idiocy of the other. #debatenight
#debatenight why would your lawyers tell you not to release @realDonaldTrump ? You're not helping your cause #soundsfishy
What is UNbelievable is Donald Trump. Period. #Debates2016 #debatenight @NBCNews @ABC @CBSNews @MSNBC @CNN He is not credible taxes are seen
"Vote for me, I haven't given much of a thought to our largest and oldest military alliance!" ...only Trump. #debatenight
Trump is that annoying kid in school who always has to have the last say &amp; gets mad when he doesn't get his way #debatenight
I guess I should I have stated this before the debate, but FYI I'm deplorable. #debatenight
Law and order can be restored starting with education in the classroom. Remove political correctness.  #Debates
Can't wait to see how Trump is going to solve America's race-related issues. #DebateNight
Hillary on Michelle Obama "When they go low we go high" ... Hillary is laughing #DebateNight
@LesterHoltNBC, the "birther issue" is over. Drop it! This country has bigger issues. #Debates2016 #TrumpVsClinton
Hillary Clinton's primary campaign strategy should be to let Donald Trump talk about race as much as he wants. #debatenight
The only reason I am surviving this debate right now is Pie. God I love pie. #debatenight
I'm so dizzy from this circle Trump keeps talking in ! #debatenight
anyone up for fact checking Trump's claim about his great temperament? #debatenight
U can release your tax returns during an audit why havent you? T: I'll release them when theyre done auditing...nobody else has to #debates
Both candidates have a villain smile but at Hillary's doesn't say "I'm going to fuck my daughter". #debatenight @LaughsTVShow
When is Lester going to address Hillarys emails, lies to American people a out them? #debatenight
Donald keeps sniffling. How's his health? Is he too weak to continue? IS THERE A DOCTOR IN THE HOUSE!!! #debatenight
Every time Trump interrupts Lester he has to blink multiple times to keep his composure 😂 #debatenight
"i settled that lawsuit with no admission of guilt" #debatenight yes, trump, that is how settlements work
Hillary says she takes responsibility for the emails, yet destroyed phones and blackberries and deleted over 30k emails #Debates
Stop and frisk??? Hmm doesn't that take away our rights!!!!! #rights #freedom  #debatenight #debates #Debates2016
Holy shit I thought we were done with this birth certificate thing #debatenight
NATO countries not paying fair share.  Says guy who doesn't pay his fair share #debatenight

Excuse me, my fellow African Americans, please your hand if Mr. Trump has built a relationship with you? #NoOneResponds #Nahhhh #debates
We are in serious trouble with these two idiots.   #debatenight
I think stabbing a screw driver into my eardrum will sound better than anything Trump says #debatenight
Kim Kardashian should release Donald Trump's tax documents tonight on Snapchat as Famous plays in the background.  #debates  #debatenight
Is that true that you were against the war in Iraq?  I doubt you @realDonaldTrump #debatenight
The fact that we need to even be having this debate is like, wtf #debatenight
I'm not even on Hilary's side but comparing to a dude who doesn't even know what is he talking about, I'd definitely be on her. #DebateNight
Hillary with the vets and troops card! That's a drink. 🍻 #debatenight
I see @HillaryClinton has come dressed in the blood of the men who have underestimated her #debatenight #Elections2016 #debates
Did you also know America looks like a third world country?? #debatenight
Trumps only supports the Stop and Frisk Program because no one would would want to touch that Big Orange Lump. #debates
Lester Holt: "this conversation is about race" (but the white candidates) #debate #debatenight
so trump is basically telling people of color to settle down, right? that's basically his plan for race relations? #debate #debatenight
Taxes are a hot #DebateNight topic. Did u know @UnitedWayDallas helped people save $65M on taxes @realDonaldTrump @HillaryClinton #OneUpThat
Trump on Clinton: I have a winning temperament. I know how to win. She doesn't. #debatenight
Ha. Have you actually seen a third world country? I have and America is gold compared to that. #DebateNight
I don't know. Whoever can make Newark Airport dope, I guess. #Debates2016
Trump just admitted he stole the whole birther schtick from Hillary. #DebateNight
Hillary is so good at hiding her facial expressions when she just cant even. I am so impressed.  #debatenight
@Trump "All talk, no action, big ideas" Is he talking about himself? #debates
Oh god @HillaryClinton has successfully trolled @realDonaldTrump into letting out his ID. So good. So fucking good. #Debates2016
Nothing helps to start the process of racial healing like discussing @BarackObama's birth certificate. #Debates2016
#debates no Hillary the leading cause of deaths among.blacks is other blacks.
Oh my god, Trump finally has a color on his face other than orange. #redtomato  #Debates2016
#debatenight Yes, taking advantage of the laws of the nation, that is the truth, you won't believe how many people do that...
Yeah, no. W/ policies like stop-and-frisk, I see everyone who does not look "American" be put in camps to "control the felons" #debatenight
@JimNorton vote for her Jimmy! He's a dick and his kids kill lions and giraffes for kicks #DebateNight #Hofstra
Trump justifying on Iraq, he sounds awful. Hillary just grins, letting him dig his hole. #DebateNight
And now for the Trump Praises Russia part of the program. #debatenight
Moderator: "Okay, lets..." Candidate: "Wait, let me just address that really quickly" M: "We have to..." C: *Proceeds to speak* #DebateNight
Nobody is selling crack and shooting other crack dealers with "MILITARY STYLE WEAPONS", you dumbass, @HillaryClinton. #debatenight
I mean, the ONLY thing you can do after that is laugh really, really hard. #debatenight
Why do I feel offended by Trump saying that he's going to get to Pennsylvania Ave. one way or another? #debatenight #d
I do love the way she just shook off that bullsh*t. #Debates2016
@debates Are you satisfied with the results of your decisions? Is America actually learning anything about these candidates?
Damn she said " Just Listen to what he said " and the crowd laughs😂 #debatenight #Debates2016 #debates She kinda Mopping Trump right now...
"That makes me smart" to not overpay taxes is the best quote from him all night.  #Debates2016
We need someone who understands money, not someone who was "dead broke" like Hillary while making 250k per speech. #DebateNight
We should bring back Law &amp; Order. It was just ONE SEASON away from setting a scripted television series longevity record. #debatenight
Shoemakers cannot keep up making enough Pinocchio's to keep up w/Donald's lies. #debates #debatenight #Debates2016 #NeverTrump #ImWithHer
hillary is staring at trump just waiting for him to die cus same #Debates
Finally getting into the releasing emails. The Queen of Bait and Switch is talking again. Why Hillary, did U destroy documents? #debates
"500 murders is a lot of murders." Thanks for that sparkling insight Donald, I appreciate it, really. #debatenight
If you need me I will be building my underground shelter #Debates2016
[on supporting Iraq war]   Trump: I never supported it "the records show otherwise" Trump: the records show I'm right   No. No #debatenight
Don't tell me what's happened - TELL ME WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO DO. #DebateNight
can hillary bring up him not believing in climate change/global warming again so he can keep denying it #debates
I think someone needs a dictionary - mistake does not equal accident. #Debates2016
Hillary looks like she's going to have a stroke if she has to listen to much more of Trump's bs #debatenight #Election2016
Clinton on the other end is keeping a steady pace, and is coming off more assertive right now. #debatenight
"We have to bring back law &amp; order"  I totally agree. I miss that bastard McCoy.  #debatenight
@HillaryClinton is full of shit too. Won't stop with the Pot charges, her buds in the private prison industry need ya. #debatenight
I want to know what was so terrible in those 33,000 emails that they needed to be bleached. #Debates2016 #DebateNight #HofDebate16
Iran was near death a little while ago. Now Iran is nearly a nuclear power. Thanks Hillary. #debatenight #Debates2016
Donald got that face of a child who was diagnosed with affluenza. "If you don't take your spoiled ass to time out..." #Debates2016
@realDonaldTrump You are getting your ass handed to you in this debate, dude. As I predicted, the debates will be your downfall.
"Why won't he release his tax returns...maybe he's not as rich as he says he is." - Hillary Clinton #debatenight #Election2016
"We need Law &amp; Order! " @realDonaldTrump shouts as he desperately scans the audience for Stabler &amp; Benson. #debatenight
"No, you're wrong, murder counts are going up" this is unbelievably scary #debatenight
Hillary is trying to be PC, Trump is still bullying, no new ideas #debatenight
I'm originally from DuPage in Illinois and it happens to hold a part of Chicago and my parents refused to let me go to the city #debates
#Trump sounds like a panicking bully. Also, learn more adjectives and adverbs.  #debatenight
I am ashamed of Americans in the live audience. Follow directions, shut up! #Debates
Did Clinton just complain about "foreign money"? That's an area she's an expert on - #debates #debatenight
DONT YOU DARE INVOKE BERNIES NAME UPON THAT STAGE FROM YOUR FOUL LIPS #Debates2016
Based on Twitter, it sounds like Trump is showing how stupid and obnoxious he really is. Excellent. #debatenight
"i have a winning temperament. i know how to win." ~ #trump  oh honey.... that's not what that means. #DebateNight #debates
Trump hasn't said one thing about his plans. He's absolute nonsense. How can people support him? The 'emperor' has no clothes! #debatenight
THIS FUCKING CHEETO DOESNT WANT PEOPLE TO BREATHE WHILE HE TALKS, BUT HE HAS TO FUCKIING INTERRUPT HILLARY?? #debatenight
Hillary talking about giving mental health support and retraining to police. Yes. Please yes. @realDonaldTrump @HillaryClinton #debatenight
Mike Pence will deal w domestic &amp; foreign policy, what will Trump do? #debatenight
And what does Trump plan on doing with those millions???!?! Give it a the people he's taking jobs from? #Debates
This free-wheeling, shoot-from-the-hip, lack-of- #preparation  approach doesn't work as well one on one @realDonaldTrump #debatenight
Lester I respect you, but c'mon man. #trump is spewing 💩. Get specifics.  #debatenight
Trump just compared the US to a 3rd world country.... Ignorance at its best 😑 #Debates
Really don't care about candidates' tax returns. Never have. More important considerations. #Elections2016 #debatenight
"She's been trying to take them out for a long time, almost as long as I've been trying to take out my lovely daughter Ivanka." #Debates2016
"I could shoot someone on fifth Avenue and not lose any voters"  Trump ain't gonna do shit #Debates
The pettiness is real. "You've been fighting ISIS your entire adult life." #DebateNight
"Now that I've resolved the very critical birther issue, I'll move on to annihilating ISIS." -Trump  Makes sense. 👍🏼  #DebateNight
Hillary: "I Prepared to be President and that's a good thing!" #yougogirl #DonaldIsAnIdiot #MadamPOTUS #StrongerTogether  #debatenight
I'm losing more and more brain cells each second listening to these fools talk #debatenight
I think trump is tryna say that they shouldn't have killed Stabler on law and order #debatenight
How many ties do you think Trump's PR team made him try on before tonight? #blue #PR #olivetsocial #Debates2016
Then release past years returns @realDonaldTrump  My word, @HillaryClinton is on fire tonight! #debatenight
With the millions of people in the US, we get stuck with Trump and Clinton as our candidates. #debatenight tragic
He has no idea about down here. He's just using us as a buzzword. Like..wow man. These problems were before Obama and after him #debates
Crop dust these 2 with a heavy dose of sativa then see what they're really made of #debatenight
Trump was watching syndicated television; Law &amp; Order came on; and he gleefully determined that he'd found his final solution. #Debates2016
Trump asking Lester Holt to please move on from the birther claim issue. #debatenight #Debates2016
FL in the debates so far: Orlando shooting, DWS, Palm Beach-"a tough community." Did I miss any? @WLRN #Florida #debatenight #Debates2016
I gotta know. Is this the first time @HowardStern has been referenced in a presidential debate? #debatenight #Debates2016 #radio
Hey you guys familiar with this "Trump" character? Would not make a good president IMO #debatenight
TRUMP, have you been to a third world country or war torn country? #debatenight
Unintended consequences = Dems cannot keep gangs out. Gangs, brought in by dems are what drag down the inner cities. #debatenight
I do not like Donald Trump. Forget he is saying absolutely nothing he is just such an unpleasant individual. #debatenight
What's all this about a debate between a #GiantDouche and a #TurdSandwich Glad I am a @GovGaryJohnson supporter. #debatenight #SouthPark20
Hey America! Wake up! Don't let Trump make you think America isn't great... It's great! #Debates
Now he's telling the proven lie about the lawsuit over his refusal to rent to African-Americans. It's bullshit. #debatenight
We know there are great officers. Hillary you missed the answer to this question. Bad officers are killed UNARMED Black men. #debatenight
Be interesting to gather all the tweets Trumps staffers are deleting today...#debatenight
"A very against police judge..." at least Lester said stop &amp; frisk was unconstitutional...  #Debates2016
If you take responsibility for your private server then turn yourself over for prosecution. #debates
Trumps response to the housing discrimination is that he "settled that lawsuit with no admission of guilt." Sure. Okay. #Debates2016
love that even Lester Holt can't take Trump seriously. Keeps trying to get him to actually ANSWER the questions #DebateNight 🙈 can't watch
"I was preparing for this debate...and I was preparing to become president."  #alltheburns #debates
All Hillary has to do is stand and smile while he implodes @debatenight @HillaryClinton
Stop and frisk?! Are you fucking kidding me? Let's just legalize profiling #debatenight
"No admission of guilt" so he's telling us he has gotten away with it,will get away with it? @runningonheavy  #debatenight
"I settled that lawsuit with no admission of guilt (SNIFF)" is not precisely a denial of guilt. #debatenight
I don't even need to watch the #debatenight , my mother is live texting it to me
How does talking about endorsements answer this question? Why can't anyone just answer the fucking question #debatenight
Hot take: Holt doing a good job. Letting candidates argue, mostly stepping in at right moments. #debatenight
HRC: He didn't pay any federal tax.   DJT: That makes me smart.   #debatenight #holyfuck
@HillaryClinton let's talk about the crime bill perv hubby signed, a bill designed to lock up black men! #Debates2016
Dear GOPnom: Like #BernieSanders, I don't care about her damn emails. She made a mistake. So do we all. #debates
If GOPnom studies his speech on race, he will note he turned the talk, organically, to gun control. #debates
Gay presidential candidates. Hmmm I don't think the world could handle that much shade. #debatenight #PresidentialDebate
I made a drinking game when @realDonaldTrump interrupts @HillaryClinton during #Debates2016 I'm already drunk &amp; I don't have property there
#debates2016  Third time little Donny Rubio drinks water.  He must be losing it already...
Well, obviously we should go after the leaders of ISIS, Mrs. Clinton.  #debatenight
HRC constantly demonizing the nations wealthiest citizens when she is one &amp; associates w/ such. #Debates2016 #DEBATES2016
Trump needs to calm down, he has 3 debates to amplify her lack of morals and failing policy. no need to vomit it all out now.
But anyone who relies on Sean Hannity is already voting for Trump... #debatenight #Debates2016 #Debate
I see the Marxist Hollywood types have the knives out on Twitter tonight! Hysterical! #Debates2016
He wants to increase US revenues by starting a global protection racket? #debatenight
Go home Lester. They don't need any moderation. Maybe a babysitter though. #debates
"Recently" @realDonaldTrump has good relations with black Americans. Why only recently, boo??? #debatenight #debates #Debates2016
Is Donald Trump using Iraq and ISIS as a metaphor for anal sex? #debates
Can they not mute this mans mike? Why he keep talking when it's not his turn? #debatenight
@realDonaldTrump says to @HillaryClinton "When you try to act, holier than thou it really doesn't work" #JSADebates #debatenight
Trump: We need law and order in inner cities. The people most affected by what's happening are African-American and Hispanics." #debatenight
What are we doing, America? He's unable to form a complete thought -- scatterbrained. #Debates2016
#debatenight @realDonaldTrump what about your scam with Trump University? I can care less about the emails she did not steal from students
Clinton should hit trump with his discrimination lawsuit cases he's been fighting for decades. #DebateNight
I'm on the fence about whether she should tell him to shut the fuck up at some point when he interrupts. #debates
The fact that these two clowns are who America picked makes me sad. #debates #Debates2016
Trump: "It's over"  Did he just prophecy the end of the world? #debatenight
Dear America, Canada is awesome. Please move to Alberta and bring your awesome ideas and innovations with you.  #debatenight
Funny how the audience was asked to be quiet and the democrats still can't shut the hell up... 🤔 #Debates2016
So far biggest complaint from Dems is Trumps interrupting and from Repubs its his sniffing.  #debatenight
Well then maybe you should hire your 10 year old to find those 30K Emails Hillary deleted. #debatenight
Trump.... no.... you did not make racial relationships with ANY of us. #debatenight #cbsnreax
Trump is just a non-stop interruption shop. He needs to learn to listen. #debatenight
Still nobody answered my man Lester question about police brutality #Debates2016 Debates
#Debates2016 Lester Holt is in the pocket of the Democrats no doubt
Why is Trump taking personal jabs when we are talking about the state of our country for the next 4 years?   #Debates
Unless the man shits himself on stage literally, several will say "presidential looking" which is kind of terrible. Do better. #debatenight
Pretty obvious that @realDonaldTrump keeps saying "secretary" to evoke images of a 1950s phone girl. #debates
Trump: "My tax cut is the biggest since Ronald Regan." Cuts helped US out of recession; the rich got much richer, the rest, not. #debates
All that mouth release those tax returns then has the gall to mention folks being ripped off?! Hello TrumpUniversity? #Debates2016 #debates
But I do like how Trump talks about law and order, because Clinton sure doesn't believe in it. #Debates2016 #DebatesNight
I gotta give it to @HillaryClinton, That "tweet" thing is pretty funny.  Getting old, but funny!! #debatenight
And @realDonaldTrump will never have to tell his 10 year old son how to get pulled over by a cop and not get killed. #debatenight
I keep trying to view this debate from the eyes of a Trump supporter, but I just -CAN'T- see it. #debates2016 #PresidentialDebate #Debates
HE WANTS LITERAL CREDIT FOR HAVING A GOLF CLIB THAT LETS BLACK PEOPLE JOIN #debatenight
#Trump you are NOT the kind of thinking this country needs. And can you please stop #yelling at us! #debatenight
Neither are answering the real question on closing the gap on racism. #PresidentialDebate #Debates2016
What do you think #nevertrump is writing on his notepad? Squiggles? Racial Slurs? Boobies? #Debates2016
And there it is: Hillary started birther....going to donate to @HillaryClinton again. #Debates2016
He hasn't actually answered one question yet. All he does is list problems.  #debatenight #Debates2016 #DonaldTrump
All talk. Sounds good.  Never gonna happen.   Ah, Trumpy. You're a wonder. #debatenight
#debatenight The question was about US first use of nuclear weapons, Donald
The debates: a haiku. Politics. Please light Me on fire and prop me up Next to MNF.
"I prepared for this debate, like I'm prepared to be President." #Debates2016 #HillYes
How can Hilary be trusted with cyber security when she can't even manage her own e-mails #debatenight

@CNN neither addressing issue on injustice &amp; police murders, talking about law not being respected, bad people &amp; bad AA #Debates2016
Privatized prisons are another reason, so many young minorities are in jail #Debates

Who would like to slap the grin off lying #CrookedHillary. Get in line; it's free.  #debatenight #Debates2016 #debates
Does ANYONE want to discuss any issues? Does ANYONE want to discuss solutions? #debatenight
One country attacking another countries ship wouldn't start a war? Im pretty sure it would trump #debatenight
Hillary just let him talk and make a fool of himself #debatenight #Debates2016
"I don't know, maybe, who know" is not what you said.  #debatenight
They suck at providing answers that are helpful. Obvious, I know. But why aren't they better? #DebateNight
@PolitiFact is killing it tonight ~ fact-checked that War in Iraq comment in less than a minute 👍🏼 #debatenight
K, got it. He made millions. She deleted emails. Can we get back to the issues? #DebateNight
Let's just make this vote on who has better grammar. "The fed is doing political..." What does that even mean?@realDonaldTrump #debatenight

You got a Robot and a Jester. Pick your poison 💀. #DebateNight
Donald trump is up there lying more than I've ever seen... Decimated black communities? What? #debatenight
Audience -- and the world -- guffaws when Trump says he has a better temperament than Clinton #debatenight
"I know what you mean to say"-Trump and men since the beginning of time #mansplaining #debatenight
Did he just say that he was responsible for getting Obama to give up his birth certificate? And now he's taking about ISIS? #DebateNight
Honestly... I'm uncomfortable with the way Trump is speaking to Clinton. Mad disrespectful #Debates
If you don't learn much from tax returns, WHY WON'T YOU JUST RELEASE THEM? #DebateNight
"We have to be very strong" is not a policy, Donald #DebateNight
These debates suck. Instead of promoting themselves, they just talk shit about each other. #BackToFootball
I just don't get it. She has been party to so many illegal actions yet she smirks. #Debates2016
I don't think they have to match plane age and pilot age #debatenight
How many AA and gangs and hispanics own gun company's?  Maybe NRA need law and order Where did the guns come from? #debatenight
WHY did Lester Holt call out the Trump supporters when they applauded but will not say anything to the Hillary supporters??? #debatenight
Clinton: "We've got to adjust the systemic #racism in our criminal justice system" #debatenight #race
Does Donald know that he is on camera when Hillary is speaking? #debatenight
Ok, I tried watching this debate, and I honestly can't even deal with Donald Trump and this whole election.Good Luck America!..#debatenight
Trump's talking about improving the infrastructure and ignoring his ethical shortcomings...like Hitler did #debatenight
Clinton saying that Muslim Americans are on front lines of battling extremism is just not true #debatenight #takeonhatewithyourvote
If you hear Trump tell it, you just walk down the inner city streets &amp; bang, you get shot. #debatenight
Trump hit with "birther" question. He was proved wrong. Places blame on someone else. #debatenight
If all things that are innefective are immediately deemed unconstitutional then our entire government would have to shut down  #debatenight
Stop and frisk in Chicago?  Not racial profiling - trump #debatenight
I am cringing listening to all of this non-sense   #Debates
Hello? Emails. 30,000 of em. Out there for anyone to see. Classified. Trump shud push this. #debatenight
#Hillary has to shut him down. She can't smile through his insanity and her jokes after the fact are weak and labored. #Debates2016 #NotGood
I knew #HilaryClinton was being WAY too quiet earlier. She ain't goin down that easy. #debatenight
Settling a law suit doesn't mean you are right, dipshit! Means u have great lawyers💸 #debatenight

Liar Liar Pants on Fire!! IRS said an audit does not hinder you from revealing taxes #debatenight
This is ridiculous! Where is #Lester? Why is he letting Trump rudely interrupt them both? #debatenight

#debatenight Anyone else have their ears bleeding from the both of them?
You don't learn that much from tax returns which is why trumps doesn't want to show them obviously #debates
Trump didn't donate a single US Dollar to his OWN foundation in the past year. #factcheck foundation return available online #debatenight
U owe $650 million to China and we're supposed to trust u on money? @realDonaldTrump  LMFAO #debatenight
What I've gotten from the #debates : Trump has a lot of "friends" and they fly into fancy airports
I cant even type what id like to about hillary right now #debatenight
Irony as taught by HRC: I deleted 30K emails to hide stuff but I'm going to accuse you of hiding stuff in your tax returns. #Debates2016
WTF stop and frisk worked really well? That's government sanctioned racism.  #Debates2016
@realDonaldTrump is that bc under you some cops get to justify killing ppl w/o due process? #Debates2016 #BLM

RT aurabogado: We have to restore trust between people of color and the police? No. There was never trust to begin with. #debatenight
When race relations come into the debate, Trump talks about his investments #debatenight #PresidentialDebate #ImWithHer
So far two NBC anchors have moderated presidential forums and so far both have been garbage. #DebateNight
Bring in Ross-Ade press box guru Jim Russell to read the no cheering in the press box statement #debatenight
Seriously, I don't believe a word either of them are saying.   #debatenight
"Someone sitting on the bed who weighs 400 pounds" anonymous that was disrespectful just saying #Debates2016
Maybe he's just a really bigly fan of the show Law and Order. #debates
Is he trying to say "terror" or "torah"? Or is he super concerned about Tara Reid? #TaraReid @TaraReid #debatenight #Debates2016
If you're not watching a channel with split screen, you are missing the fuck out. #debatenight
"I settled that lawsuit with no admission of guilt." ....which doesn't mean you didn't do it. #debatenight
Big fat ugly bubble. So yeah, Trump just personified our economy as cystic acne. #Debates2016
Trump legit believes this debate is a harmonized call and response Gospel hit. Just sprinkling words in her speech for affect #Debates2016
Do you think it was planned for Hillary and Donald to wear opposing party colors? 🤔 #debatenight
He said "take the guns away", doesn't he also argue that's Hillary's line? #debatenight
@realDonaldTrump You lying sack. You did say you would negotiate with our creditors of our National Debt. #DebateNight
@realDonaldTrump why you deleting tweets?  Can't stand being held accountable?  #liar #fraud #scam #debatenight #debates #Debates2016
Come on @LesterHoltNBC CUT HIM OFF LIKE YOU WANT. I CAN HEAR IT IN YOUR VOICE. #debatenight
"I've been all over, you just stayed home, but that's ok" he sure knows how to change the subject #Debates2016 #nevertrump
If interest rates get raised the bubble will pop transparency is needed within trade deals and financial regulation is paramount.  #debates
It's embarrassing Hillary Clinton even has to share a stage with this clown #DebateNight
Why does Trump feel the need to take shots at HC about her length of service? Experience counts #debates #PresidentialDebate
I seriously can't listen to Trump's crap. I am getting dumber by the minute. #debatenight
#debatenight saying "African Amer. and Hispanics are living in Hell" is discrimination, I've seen a lot of white Amer. also living in Hell
#debatenight "I won't make competence an issue in this campaign. I am not going to exploit for political purposes Mr Trump's total madness."
How is stop and frisk constitutional? Never mind the 4th Amendment #debatenight
Hillary actually called most of the country racist on the debate stage! #debatenight
#debatenight He is toast so far. He can't get free of her skilled fillet knife. Actually rather staggering.
Oh, endorsement from police union that denies the fact minorties face discriminatory police killings and violent actions??? #debatenight
Mmmmmmmmmm Wikileaks/Russia thing is a mess. Russia is a scapegoat for Clinton/DNC. They screwed the Sanders campaign #Debatenight
Clinton "He doesn't pay federal taxes"  Trump "That makes me smart"  Wat  #Debates2016
"He doesn't pay taxes" - Hillary "That makes me smart"-Trump  Wtf??? I pay f*cking taxes!!!!! #Debates2016
#debates, #Debates2016 #debatenight #votetogether  "Taxes don't tell you that much."   And I declared bankruptcy FIVE TIMES
Donald Trump is the first presidential candidate that has dodged every single question asked of him during a debate #Debates2016
LOL: Vote for me. I got the president to produce his birth certificate. #debatenight
We are going to need a lot longer for this debate... #debatenight
With all the water he's drinking, will Trump last all 90 minutes without a potty break? #debatenight
We need better police, not necessarily more police. And, yes, better community relations. #debatenight
I really don't care about the tax returns or emails- what happened with the ACTUAL issues.?!? #Debates2016
It's time someone make the FBI and DOJ look bad for letting HilLIARy on the slide #Debates
'We can't alienate our allies' says the woman who left four of our servicemen behind in Benghazi to die.  #Debates2016 #debatenight #debates
Did #Trump just say he was smart for avoiding paying any Federal Taxes for years???? #debatenight #debate2016
The birth certificate question is sinking Trump. He sounds like a rambling coke head at the bar. #DebateNight
Ashton Kutcher has to be in the back with his friends telling Trump what to say. This has to be Punk'd. HAS to be. #debatenight
"he hasn't paid his taxes" "that makes me smart" lmfao same #debatenight
@HillcrestWard7 this clown hasn't been in our communities. Saying the same crap in rallies. #debatenight @realDonaldTrump
"I have a much better temperament than she does."    Is he at this debate right now? Is this an outer-body experience for him?  #debates
All America's Enemy are cheering for Hillary Clinton! Can't you see that?  #debatenight
Shouting from the roof tops here... Trump supports racial profiling vis stop-and-frisk #debatenight
Don't pander. Just stay on message and keep talking the plan. #debatenight
"If I don't get do PA Avenue, I'll get there another way." Does he think this is Monopoly? #Debates2016
"This conversation is about race." Thank you @LesterHoltNBC for getting us back on track. #Debates2016
"We provide a service . . . And they don't pay their fair share." Like how Trump doesn't pay his contractors? #Debates2016
@ShaunKing he isn't the sharpest tool in the shed. But indeed a tool. #DEBATENIGHT #Debates2016
DID DONALD TRUMP REALLY JUST SAY THE RICH WILL SHARE THEIR MONEY WITH HIS TAX CUT? HAHAHAHAHA #debatenight #Debates2016 #PresidentialDebate
hillary will take amerikkka to war donald trump will upgrade 3rd world amerikkkan airports white people will still b rich #debatenight
YOU DO NOT GET BROWNIE POINTS FOR FILING YOUR MANDATORY FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE DONALD #debatenight

"Cyber is very very tough. I always ask A/S/L and if they say Afghanistan or Iraq, I just block them." #debatenight #Debates
Trump Supporters are nothing but stupid hicks that live in the early 1860's. #debatenight
#debatenight headlines: many people get drunk after this debate bc this is so problematic
Donald what about all the construction workers you pay the minimum wage. Is that a little bread theory #Debates2016 #PresidentialDebate
Lester: *asks about domestic terrorism* Hillary and Trump: *talks about Iraq, Libya, ISIS*  #debatenight
Please tell me someone is keeping a tally on how many times Trump yells 'wrong' over Clinton ? #Debates2016
Jesus Christ, in all of that rambling response, he came nowhere within sight of a rational thought #debatenight
I think this is one of the first debates I’ve watched in my adult life… and it’s terrifying.
Guys, he did a Howard Stern interview on this stuff. Seems legit. #debatenight
Holt was definitely not here tonight as a moderator. Getting shouted down all over the place. #debatenight
"He took an awkward drink! See?! It can happen to anyone!" Marco Rubio in a nearly empty bar somewhere in Florida. #Debates2016
This is insane! I wonder how long it will take before @HillaryClinton looses it?   #debatenight
The stop and frisk policy gives the police power for organised racism. Pretty much happens in UK too! #debatenight
Not posting anything specific on the debates because I'm not trying to start an argument 😅
#debatenight Trump has lost it.  Trump started strong but all Hillary had to do was pull the pin and wait. Neither of these people are fit
Dear Donal Trump, we chicagoans would like to be excluded from this narrative. #debatenight
Shout out to the doctors &amp; surgeons who worked their butts off &amp; dedicated their lives to provide for someone else's family #Debates2016
So one sentence he's bashing China saying it's the worst, and in the next he's calling on them to invade North Korea. #ok then #debatenight
I know how you feel @HillaryClinton , I smile when faced with stupid people too... 😂😂 #debatenight
#debatenight @realDonaldTrump agrees with @HillaryClinton that people on watch lists should be banned from gun ownership? #2A @NRA
What a massive step backwards it would be, after having our first African-American president, to elect such a racist monster! #debatenight
@realDonaldTrump bragging about his endorsements is not an argument in a debate #Debates
And let's just move on from these damn emails. I never want to hear about her emails again. Ever. Not one word about email #DebateNight
The TV show Law and Order isn't going to help you here Mr.Trump #Debates
Next up: Discussion on #race, police shootings. How will they heal the divide? #debatenight
.@HillaryClinton: Gun epidemic is leading cause of death among AA men. 'We have to tackle plague of gun violence.' #debatenight
The AA community has been let down by politicians, Trump says. 'Used and abused to get votes.' #debatenight
'He has started his whole campaign on this racist lie that our first black president was not an Amer citizen,' Clinton says. #debatenight
'I think cyber war fare will be one of the biggest challenges facing next president,' Clinton says. Most troubling is Russia. #debatenight
All talk no action. I'll kick some that fat ugly economic bubble in its ass. Trump. #DebateNight
I made $684 million last year, but I won't tell you how much I paid in taxes. Trump. #DebateNight
We're going to spend money on police, once we audit the crap out of Trump and make him pay. Clinton. #DebateNight
WHY are you audited for 15 years?! This is a good thing?! #Debates2016 @realDonaldTrump
“Maybe its because you haven’t paid any Federal income tax for years” #Debates2016
@FoxNews @realDonaldTrump But he lost a 1 billion court case against a Chinese #Debates2016
Here comes Trumps outsider dynamic that WORKS for him. The public despises "typical politicians" &amp;rightfully so. #Debates
Hillary be firm. Swing for the fences &amp; defend it. Because you can. You have the intelligence to defend it. Be firm. Stand with us. #Debates
Trump needs to MOVE ON from endorsing  "stop &amp; frisk"  #NotASolution  #LetItGo #debates
C'mon Hillary! Push through. Say it again. No ones rights should be violated because of the neighborhood they are from. #debates
I'll just say this - the @FoxNews live stream has been incredible so far. A seamless viewing experience. #debatenight
How long until the crowd start shouting "JERRY! JERRY! JERRY! JERRY!"  #debates
Can they please say "cyber" more? It reminds me of my 12yr old self scouring Lesbian AIM chatrooms  #debatenight
Another American who refused to pay his workers because the work was "not up to par": H. H. Holmes. #debatenight
oh boy who wants to bet trump says a racial slur #debates
Jeez Louise... Will HE answer one question tonight?  The Hyperbole doesn't work on the National Stage.  He has no plans. #debatenight
Settled that lawsuit with no admission of guilt ... so what is he saying?  #Debates
The Donald is simply rude. Thinks he can yell &amp; interrupt &amp; go over his time. Bully all the way #Debates
@HillaryClinton Obama released your Guantanamo bay friends. That turned around and did more attacks against USA. #Debates2016
Did Donald do a giant line of coke before the debate? :sniffles: #debatenight
Donald Trump's hair is distracting me more than the bullshit coming out of his big mouth 😐  #debatenight
Except Billie won RT @STL_Blonde: This is Billie Jean King versus Bobby Riggs.  #Debates2016
he just keeps stringing random words together interspersed with insults and his points make no sense. #debatenight
Did Donald just brag about how much money he made last year? #debates
Refused to pay? Is this Jeffree and Kat all over again? 😂 #debatenight
It's a mess. A total mess. Many of the 28 NATO countries are loser countries. #debatenight
I have much better judgement than her. I have a much better temperament. #debatenight
Wait, now he's proud of that thing he tried to blame HRC for? #debatenight
Who cares about Trump's tax returns? Seeing the deleted emails by Clinton is way more important to everyone in this country. #Debates2016
LESSSSSSTER. Where the eff is your backbone?! GET CONTROL over his lies. Check him boo.  #debatenight #debates
Nights like this one make me miss being in the politics and social justice section at Medill. #debatenight
Hillary make up your mind... Is the middle class doing really well or not well??? Your so up and down! #debatenight
Trump just put his 10 year old son in charge of cyber. I think. I can't hear over my own weeping. #debatenight
#debates #debatenight Lester has to stop Trump from interjecting every time Clinton speaks three words.
Do Trump's handlers think muting his orange hue and attaching a blue tie make him seem calmer? #debatenight #Debates2016
#debatenight fail at your job you are contracted to do and don't expect to be paid
Her plan for the economy is in a book you can buy at the airport. #debatenight
Did Donald Trump just say his strongest asset by far was his temperament?? 🤔 The Fuck? #debatenight
"And you know what else I prepared for? I prepared to be President." 🙌🏻🙌🏻🙌🏻🙌🏻🙌🏻 YES HRC #debates
yo everyone who is having a hard time listening to the #debatenight is welcome to move to Australia for a bit
Trump:"I did not support the war on Irak. I was against it." Lester:"The record shows otherwise." Trump:"No." #Debates2016
I've said this before, Lester, to you actually, and now I'm repeating it, so I'm sure you'll agree. #sayittilitstrue #debatenight
He keeps using language that only pertains to rich people, surprising no one. #debatenight
You will learn more about @realDonaldTrump when you go to Atlantic City and see how has casinos have failed AC #Debates2016
"Well it's a very simple answer....let me name drop someone irrelevant to answering your question" -basically trump #debatenight
#Debates2016 The US or any other lcountry that has too many guns will always have violence. U need to cut the amount of guns.
He isn't even capable of standing up straight, forget him actually answering a question! #debatenight #Debates2016
I am optimistic about America. More &amp; more Americans see these Parties for what they are. Their days in Power are numbered. #debatenight
Trump struggles every time he says 'Secretary Clinton'. Doesn't he know fear of the name increases fear of the thing itself? #debatenight
@chelseahandler I'm calling for a #stopandfrisk right now on @realDonaldTrump. He clearly is on some kind of euphoric drug. #debatenight
Missed opportunity @HillaryClinton didn't rebut @realDonaldTrump's "super predator" remark w #CentralPark5 full page ad by him #Debates2016
The view from the tv in the nurses station is not doing this #DebateNight justice. #emergencyroom #psychwardround2
"I STAYED HOME AND PREPARED TO BE PRESIDENT, AND I THINK THAT IS A GOOD THING." #HILLARY   #DEBATES2016
Now the tactic is to mock Hillary for believing in climate change? #debatenight
Trump, completely red faced and screaming: I HAVE A MUCH BETTER TEMPERAMENT THAN SHE DOES #debatenight
"Look at the mess we're in." I was just thinking the same thing.... #debatenight
A candidate is advocating for a direct violation of our 4th amendment rights &amp; selective application of 2nd amendment rights #DebateNight
Apparently Hillary Clinton is only getting 73% of every minute Donald gets to yell about his "policy" for this debate. #Debates2016
Black communities have problems with crime. Where have u been Hillary? Not in a black community #Debates

His picture isn't negative. It's real. Shit is scary for poc, man. It's fucking dangerous to be not white. #debatenight
No no no growing the fucking government! No. No. No. Vote #GaryJohnson for smaller, less intrusive government. #LetGaryDebate #debatenight
.@HillaryClinton NAILS profit-motivated prisons and racial bias; all @realDonaldTrump can say is "law and order" #emptywords #debatenight
Why is he talking about Law &amp; Order? LOL, because he belongs on an episode of SVU with his nasty daughter lusting self. #debatenight
Lester: "We're talking about racial healing in this segment." Subtext: Put some respeck on my debate and stay on topic,damnit. #debatenight
[im sorry but] YAASS TRUMP CALLING OUT THE DNC &amp; DWS FOR WHAT THEY DID TO BERNIE #debatenight
Hillary just took it back to 1973 with some serious news.   #Debates #debatenight #PresidentialDebate I really want Trump to respond.
"It's about time that this country had somebody running it that has an idea about money" - Trump  #debates #awesome
I'm African American. Grew up in the South. Never lived in the inner city. Judt sayin. Kanye shrug. #DEBATENIGHT #DEBATES
When Hillary accuses Trump of bait and switch and replies with bait and switch. #debatenight
If a father is a racist, odds are the son will grow up the same. Guthrie sang of old man Trump's racism, now look at the son. #debatenight
LESTER: How is your judgement any better to Clintons TRUMP: Oh I have a much better judgement #DebateNight
#debatenight hey dipshits. Tax planning is smart. You don't like the law change it. Tax evasion is illegal. That's not the same
Trump thinks paying taxes is bad business because investing in this country is something he's been trying to avoid his whole life #debates
Everything Trump has said so far is a commercial for his businesses by somebody who doesn't understand business or advertising #debatenight
Hillary's grandad used to pay hard working fish to jump into the net #Debates2016
What the hell does Donald's 10 year old have to do with this discussion? How is that a plausible solution to cyber sec issues? #debatenight
LESTER WHERE ARE YOU? ARE YOU LATE? WAS THERE TRAFFIC? STUFF IS HAPPENING MAN, YOU NEED TO BE HERE. #debatenight #PresidentialDebate
I feel like CTV should have a photo of JTru scroll along the ticker-tape as a salve to Canadian viewers. #debatenight
I need Trump to pay for my medical bill because my head is killing me and no amount of Excedrin is working! #debatenight
#debatenight If Trump was around right after the civil war, he would be called a carpetbagger.
@USATOpinion idk who won on the economy but at least @HillaryClinton is helping her own pocket book by using #Debates2016 to sell books
#debatenight Never have I been more in favor of giving the moderator control of a car battery connected to electrodes on the candidates.
#debatenight This NATO word salad is the best I've had in quite some time.
If I'm a non-politics obsessed American voter who doesn't use Twitter, I'm probably bored of the debate by this point. #debatenight
YOU WERE PRESSING IT YOU CLOWN. YOU PUSHED IT AFTER HE RELEASED IT YOU CHUM-SEMENED MONSTER #debatenight
Financial statement of sorts! Hillary should just start facepalming as her reply to everything #DebateNight #Debates2016
#debatenight Clinton says if your main claim to be Pres is your businesses, I've met many workers who have been "stiffed" by you
#debatenight Clinton says Trump supported the invasion of Iraq, to which Trump interjects "No, no." Trump calls invasion a disaster.
I feel like Admiral Stockdale right now. "Who am i? How did I get here?" #debatenight #debates #debatenight
Just tuned into the #debates between Lester Holt and Donald Trump.  Boy do I miss @marcorubio.
@prettyswank i .. should be? i feel like i should be. but normal debates give me headaches/panic feels, all the bak/forth. i'd die watching.
Hillary is a force with her knowledge and experience...Trump you are shrinking #MSNBC #CNN #DebateNight
I need to be drunk to watch this crap. I am still thinking of buying my own island. #debatenight
I'm not Hillary's biggest fan. But this man is nowhere near capable of running our country.  He can't even debate properly.   #Debates2016
#debates WTF is he talking about Where is his solutions doesn't he know Law&amp;Order is a TV show
He said he is out for himself and his businesses... does that trouble anyone else? #debates
Lets be real people Trump won't release his tax returns because he is not a billionaire. He's upper middle class #Debates2016
I am sorry this is just insulting that a woman with this level of intelligence and experience has to deal with this baboon #Debates2016
Id lay money she has something to do with birther to help her until it didn't #debatenight
Trump is like the class clown &amp; hillary the vice principal #DoesAnyoneReallyLikeEither #DebateNight
Trump "the McClathy report went to Africa and failed to get the birth certificate" It wasn't in Africa. #Debates
Trump: 'Not like you and *your* president thinks.' Wait. Trump. Show us your birth certificate. #debatenight
We got through both answers on race without hearing the phrase "Black Lives Matter." #Debates2016
@HillaryClinton Right on the money! She's mad woke. All the reasons why Trump is the most suspect of them all #Debates
Tump: it could have been a 400lb person on their bed hacking the #dnc #factcheck #PresidentialDebate #debatenight #debates2016
She doesn't want to take away a single second of time from Trump, rarely going past her allotted time. #debatenight #PresidentialDebate
You have an idea about money? No, your daddy did.....he just gave you all of his businesses and money #Debates2016
He can't conduct himself with any grace during a debate, how would be conduct himself in the face of a tragedy as president? #debatenight
Keep avoiding the questions by name-dropping the organizations that endorse you, Trump. #Debates2016
"We need law and order" from the guy who was bragging about how he knows how to exploits loopholes... #DebateNight
So our President SHOULD have produced his birth certificate earlier?  Who the hell does Trump think he is? #debatenight
"I have a much better temperament than her" Trump. He throws insults everyday #debatenight #lair #ImWithHer
@barnfeline lol! True. Sorry poodles!  #TrumpTheIrateTribbit #debatenight #uspoli. Please #UnitedStates don't follow stupid. Aka Trump

"[Trump's tax returns] will be released"  things that wont happen for 500, alex  #debatenight
Trump asking the important questions in this debate. "Why did she delete 30,000 emails?!" #Debates2016 #debates #DebateNight
Normally Trump would pay yuge dollars to get a high heel snapped off in his ass. Tonight it's happening for free.#Debates2016 #debatenight
Let's move onto cybersecurity. You guys watch Mr. Robot or no? #debatenight
In football, what do they say when the "offense" has gets after the "defense"? "Exposed"! #debates

@ibleedcoffee Damn straight, most of us Trump supporters have to work for a living, not being funded to protest by Soros #debatenight #MAGA
She needs to loosen up but nonetheless answering much better than Trump #debatenight
Get @piersmorgan to host this event. He'd have more of a presence than @LesterHoltNBC #debatenight
Trump midkey saying he's taking the White House one way or another. #debatenight
I'm relaxing by watching with the volume turned off for a while  debatenight
I think the writers of "Swimfan" are more educated on cyber security #Debates2016
What did Trump's 10-year-old son's computer skill have to do with anything? #Debates2016
#debatenight many people haven't been to these places to which the US is being compared &amp; putting the country down is not publicly appealing
Trump can't stop interrupting has to be reminded by moderator that he agreed to rules. #debatenight
HRC's saving grace is that she is slightly less off-putting than Trump. What if this was Rubio or Kasich opposite her on stage? #Debates2016
Wondering whether Hillary will use her "why am I not beating this guy by 50 points" line in her closing statement. #Debates2016
So, according to Trump, tax avoidance via tax havens exists bcs of poor leadership? Not rich people avoiding paying tax?? #debatenight
Someone tell the Donald that he can not keep agreeing with HRC.  THIS IS A DEBATE!!! #debatenight

@realDonaldTrump forget to say that the admirals &amp; generals supporting him are actually Russian #debatenight @HillaryClinton
Did Trump just blame America's problems on the fact that LaGuardia is a shithole? #debatenight
Wait wait wait wait are we still talking about that birth certificate? @POTUS must be laughing. #debatenight
Trump please explain how Barack Obama is responsible for 4000 Chicago lives? #debatenight #debates
"Now they have the oil all over the place!" That does sound like a problem. #debates
It's great how this debate hasn't even started talking about policies. At all. None. Is this even a debate? Or an argument? #debatenight
Soooo...my people are killed by the police and you tout an endorsement from the FOP?? #Debates2016

Anyone who says I've developed relationships with "the African American community" only has white friends  #Debates
omg, how can trump be so rude?????????? he doesn't have any sense of education and politely #Debates
Line of the night... "Let's just blame everything on me." "Why not?" #debatenight I mean... at this point, what difference does it make?
All Trump does is bash Hillary Clinton and talk about his money. He has no real idea how to do anything else.  #debatenight
Trump: If I say it enough times, will it become true? #debatenight
"That makes me smart" HOW CAN ANYONE VOTW FOR THIS MAN #debatenight
It's official now that the moderator and Clinton are tag teaming against Trump! Fact checking?  #debates
make reference to a general that's been dead for 50 years, and talk about how much he needs a tax cut #debatenight
Trump: I have much better judgement than Hillary: Bring back racial profiling,5yr Birther scam, stop &amp; frisk, etc  #debatenight #necndebate
If you squint, you can convince yourself that Trump is wearing a dickie, ascot, and yachting jacket. And that he's human. #debatenight
So only illegal immigrants shoot people? How do you stop the violence? Don't blame Obama you moron! #debates
"You've seen me all over the place and stayed home and that's okay" #debatenight
Lol trump checking the fact checker #debatenight Chicago is doing really bad that is true

Please do Trump. Please name them all day long to honor those who have been killed. Please do. #debatenight

Her smile is looking more and more like a Chucky doll and I'm hiding under the covers now #debatenight
Mr. Trump I know the NRA and they are not good ppl. #debatenight
My takeaway:  Hill allows herself to be dragged down to Trumps level. #debatenight
Am I the only one that doesn't fuck wit anything Donald Trumps says #debatenight
Trump talking about stop and frisk is getting me heated  #debatenight
"I think Donald just criticized me for preparing for this debate" SLAY HILARY #debatenight
Trump just claimed war crimes don't start wars....has he even seen Empire Strikes Back? #DarthTrump #debatenight
Trump is squandering his opportunities.  Right now, she is eating his lunch.   #debates #COSproject #TCOT

Hillary should stay away from back and forth; stick to answers. Let Donald yell and lie. Hillary's best when she talks details #debatenight
You can just feel the angst in Lester's voice every time he says, "You have 2 minutes." #debatenight
#LesterHolt - Hilary is just letting the sniffing, douchebag ramble on &amp; smiling like a Cheshire cat. #LMAO #debates

ISIS didn't form when Paul Bremer "de-bathified" the Iraqi army and security forces. Oh, wait... #debates
Watching this debate in a room full of 150 college students is making this 10x more stressful #Debates2016
Donald is acting like a spoiled little boy. NOT Presidential. FYI. #Debates2016

Maybe we'll find the birth certificate and deleted emails inside of Donald's tax returns. #debates
Yo this is like the kid on the playground who's losing and then changes the rules. "I'll release my tax returns when..." #Debates2016
I bet Sarah Palin can watch Donald Trump hanging out with Vladamir Putin from her house! #Debatenight #debates
Two white people calling each other a bigger racist.  Pretty cringe worthy for both of them...  #debates

"You don't learn that much from tax returns." - Donald Trump  The world: UH, no dude.   Fact checkers: WRONG.  #debatenight
Trump's plan to heal the racial divide in America:  There's my African American! Look, the African Americans love me! The end. #debatenight
Trump says things like, "you're wrong" without providing any counterpoint or statistic. Please take a seat or sip more water. #debatenight
the clinton smile is really creepy and she needs to stop #debatenight
It´s very easy for a white collar criminal to defeat you being himself, especially when you are a decent citizen. #Debates2016
A prudent and self-controlled leader or a imprudent and silly mind misleading your present and destiny? See the difference? #Debates2016
We should ask Melania to recite that speech since she knows it so well. #DebateNight
Trump did not learn the lesson the Benghazi committee learned the hard way: No one cares about Sidney Blumenthal. #debates
Bringing back "Law and Order" would be awesome if Jerry Orbach were still alive. #debatenight
Absolutely spot on! LMFAOOO!!! RT @youngsinick: This is a Real Housewives reunion. #debatenight
I think Trump is thinking of a way to get out of the next two debates.
Yo! This dude just admitted 2 tax evasion? Are we paying attention? Lester??? Follow up. Follow up. Do your JOB. OMG. #Debatenight #NYDebate
All that damn money and Trump can't clip them split ends in this comb over,brah😒 #debates
Her charity went to the Clinton Foundation which went right back into her pocket.... #Debates2016
How many times is Drumpf going to bring up my favorite off air TV show? #debatenight #lawandorder
Did Trump just compare leading the nation in racial healing to opening a country club that doesn't discriminate? #Debates2016
@MSNBC @CNN The Bush Economic Policies Created the great recession, I hate to see what Trump's tax cut for HIMSELF will do! #debatenight
Hillary: "Crime is down, including murder." Trump: You're wrong but go off I guess... #DebateNight
Mrs. Clinton stop smiling in serious moments !! It just makes you look unauthentic! #Debates2016
Notice how Trump hasn't denied ANY of Hillary's allegations regarding his taxes.  But the narrow minds will give him a pass. #DebateNight
"I have a much better temperament than she does" On what Planet??? #ImWithHer #@HillaryClinton #debatenight
#debatenight "Maybe he is not as rich as he says he is" truuuuu
Ever since Hillary was 18 years old, she's been fighting ISIS. So proud! #debatenight
Trump just brought up facts with the Middle East and $6 trillion in debt and Hillary comes back with pay your income tax? #debatenight
Trump about to lose the black vote. I think he's literally minutes away from it.  #debatenight
Defining moment of this debate will be the travesty that is Trump's flailing attempt to defend his bother movement #Debates2016 #ImWithHer
Oh God this man wants New York's Stop &amp; Frisk. You gotta be kidding. #debatenight
Those deleted emails are way more important than a tax return. #debatenight
I feel like I’m watching SNL and am waiting for one of them to yell “And live from New York, it’s Saturday Night!”... #Debates
My bp is rising listening to Trump, I may not finish watching this debate, I know who I'll vote for anyway. #debatenight

Didn't you go into bankruptcy Donald you wanna talk about money #debatenight
I hate to agree with Trump about anything, but HRC's campaign *did* really lay into Obama in 2008 in unfair ways. #Debates2016 #Debatenight
IM AM TIED OF THESE POLITICIANS USING OUR PPL FOR PROPAGANDA ACTING LIKE THEY GONNA HELP NIGGAS AND THEY AINT! THEY NOT! #Debates
"We need law and order in our county." Sir...SVU is on Wednesdays at 9pm on NBC. Also almost always has reruns on tv. DUN DUN 😂 #Debates

This is seriously grotesque. I cannot believe this man is this close the White House. #debatenight
"It's all words, it's all sound bites" - funny enough, this can literally describe Donald J. Trump's entire candidacy #debatenight
Could have been a 400 pound person...he doesn't like fat people either. #debatenight #fb
Government is not for profit.  You do the right thing because it's the right thing.  Not to charge people. #debatenight
The record shows you are wrong. "I'm right" - @realDonaldTrump #debatenight These poor fact checkers
Clinton grilling Trump about his tax returns. Claims he's hiding something #DebateNight #Debates2016
I feel bad for the guy that has to sit there and listen to this bullshit from the both of them #DebateNight
Trump just won the debate by throwing Sean Hannity under the bus #debatenight
Watching the presidential debate with my dad @edjackman. Way to dance around all your questions Trump. #DebateNight
this debate deadass made me fall asleep for 10 minutes it's so boring #debatenight
#debatenight is proving just how scary the outcomes of this election may be....glad Trump knows how to avoid answering questions...
He's close to one minute now..... 20 seconds, smh, stick to your given time MR. TRUMP #debatenight
I've been sober for a long time but if I took a shot every time Trump couldn't answer a question I would be dead with a .7 BAC #debates
I'm still very confused as to why they thought he was not an American???? #Debates2016
"Just listen to what you've heard" - Secretary Clinton #debates [Ladies and gentlemen, your next President of the United States of America]
Trump is the old grouchy guy next door that hates everything and thinks everyone is ruining his life.   #debatenight #Debates2016 #debates
Trump is such a little coward. Just release it or Clinton's talk is all fact. #debatenight
I suppose a house with no golden chairs is hell to him. #debatenight
A white woman said blacks get arrested more often for the same crime committed by whites...will we believe it now? #debatenight #pacevotes16
And this debate is brought to you by the world "Wrong" and the letter F #PaceVotes16 #debatenight
Oh SNAP! "You know what else I prepared for? To be president!" That's some shade for #snatch game! @RuPaul @HillaryClinton #Debates2016
No, Palm Beach is NOT the wealthiest community in the world. BELIEVE ME (I live in Florida) #debatenight
How long b4 #Beelzebub breaks thru the Earth's crust, grabs @realDonaldTrump &amp; shouts "We're sorry!"? #Debates2016
Any political platform that doesn't protect the most vulnerable doesn't reflect core religious values of care &amp; compassion. #debatenight
" a man that can be easily provoked by a tweet should not have access to the nuclear codes" #debatenight
this man is stunting on the gram but he's actually a motherfuckin broke boi he has no bitches n his whip game is not proper #debates
who needs the GOP and McCarthyism when the Democrats are taking holds of that rein this election #debatenight #debates
Tired of all the bs talk just blow up the whole middle east and we will have a good usa  #debates
#debates #Debates2016 how long can they talk about "no fly list" ? the question  remains: what are u gonna do for the average people?
Hillary saying trumps hiding something by not releasing his taxes is funny, she's same lady who destroyed cell phones to hide shit #debates
@DHSgov you should talk to @ICEgov - wasn't aware they could endorse a political candidate #Debates2016
The NRA agreed to restricting guns to people on the no fly list? When did that happen? #Debates2016
#debates You are working with your friends in the Me to sell us out!!
Is that the pot calling the kettle black?!?! Temperament?! I think its time for bed. This is too much. #debatenight  #JesusTakeTheWheel
#debatenight got me stress eating the rest of the mochi. Sorry @BloodshotBabe. I'll get more tomorrow
"there are so many problems lester. and cyber is one of them."  cyber... what? #Debates2016
Every time I think Trump is actually going to get to an actual point, he stops the thought &amp; starts over #debates
Trump needs to stop letting her get away with lies and ask for DETAILS. #debatenight
I mean LaGuardia is bad, but it's definitely not 3rd world, Donald. #livinginyourownreality #Debates2016
#debatenight Did Hilary plant birther question? Seems she used it to make certain points about racism. not a major concern for voters
"It's all words, it's all soundbites." Oh are you talking about yourself? #debatenight
So...apparently it's the illegal immigrants who are responsible for the guns... #debatenight #debate2016
Trump is missing points like a dart board after I do a round of shots. #debatenight
If I just YELL it out it is going to be true! 🙄 #Debates
I was with Hillary on that answer until she talked about guns. That has nothing to do with race relations. #debatenight
He's literally up there saying the same shit in ten different ways with the same trigger words. #debatenight
This debate is a mess not because of the candidates, but because of Lester Holt NOT DOING HIS JOB AND MODERATING THE DEBATES #DebateNight
Thank you. At least #Trump will bring up the debacle in #Chicago and the thousands of deaths in a GUN FREE CITY! #debatenight #Debates2016
The tweets on #debatenight are hilarious but sad. Can't the American people can vote no confidence in both and give @POTUS another term?
What?! Say it ain't so @JessicaGottlieb, @realDonaldTrump dissing us on the #debatenight? Thats why we with her! @HillaryClinton
I've been trying really hard not to swear at trump during my tweets of the #debatenight had to take 'shit sipper' out of one just now.
so HOWWWWWWW. law and order how. by taking away guns? or what what. #Debates
HillaryClinton: We are not going to bring New York’s unconstitutional stop-and-frisk program nationwide. #debatenight
Clinton: "you shouldn't have a profit motive to put young Americans in prison". No kidding. Unconstitutional. #debates
I guess the "law" in "law and order" only applies to the criminal statutes, not the Constitution. #debatenight #PresidentialDebate
Every time Trump interrupt Hilary we have to drink a shot. Let's play and get drunk :D #debatenight
I'm def looking for a candidate that thinks it's "smart" to have avoided paying taxes. Definitely. 🙄 #debatenight
How did  Obama start ISIS ?? #debatenight by taking the troops out ?
Oh so now you care about Latinos and Black people. @realDonaldTrump is a lying bitch! #debatenight #debates
@shaleathaevon like don't comment on what you're doing for the black community. Cause you aren't doing shit. Like stfu Trump.  #Debates
Ugghhhhh why can't Donald just answer a fucking question directly. Without all the bullshit?  #debates
I'm laughing at this #debatenight, but then I realize it's not SNL...
Where is the plan. All I hear is regurgitated information that I can google. #Debates
Trump will not gain black voters if he continues to advocate stop and frisk. #Debates2016
Ready for the Punk'd Crew to come busting out of the backdrop to tell us this is all a big joke. #Debates2016
#debatenight #cbsnreax @HillaryClinton is trying so hard to get at trump but no one can take him down
"My tax cut is the biggest since Ronald Reagan AKA THE EARLY 1980s RECESSION AND TAX AND DEBT CRISIS" #debatenight
Telling the moderator to "listen" just proves how rude you are, Donald. #debatenight
Deadbeat Donald is proud to be a deadbeat when it comes to paying taxes #debatenight
Is this the first time @HowardStern  has been mentioned during a debate? #debatenight
#Rambln'Don is all over the place. Is Sean Hannity in your cabinet?? #debatenight
@realDonaldTrump your lawyers are telling you not to release your returns because you are a fraud! #debatenight
#debatenight "For the thousands of people you have stiffed over the course of years, don't they deserve an apology"- HC What say you Donald?
#debatenight livestream the guy in NC was shot and killed by ANOTHER PROTESTER NOT THE POLICE.  That has been PROVEN.
debates are literally two people roasting each other in a sophisticated manner
calm tf down and let hillary talk for once thanks  #debatenight
Every time they say law and order I start singing the theme song and my family is yelling at me BC they're trying to listen #debatenight
Sooooo, take away guns from people but no change in police force?????? #debatenight
Let's go ahead and throw people who struggle with weight into the mix of people Donald Trump marginalizes. #DebateNight #ImWithHer
Your "temperament" and lack of composure is what's going to lead to getting this nation attacked. Trump reacts too quickly #debatenight
Hillary Clinton just said police are bias in terms of race...I can't believe she just said that on worldwide television. #Debates2016
Donald Trump Sound Dumb As Hell ! DONT @ ME ! #Debates
It scares me that everyone in the audience is supporting Trump #debates
Scam people for a living and donate money that isn't your own... Wonder why you get audited #DebateNight
"Saying 'No, you're wrong!' is what annoying kids at school do." #debatenight #Debates2016
Who woulda thought it would come down to two blondes?! 👱🏻👩🏼 #Blonde #debates2016
'Oh you wanna talk about m(others)ayers' is hillary lowkey quoting white chicks orrr 🤔 #debates
@realDonaldTrump: "I have a much better temperament than she does." First time I've laughed along with a debate audience. #Debates
I will not subtweet about the debate. I will not subtweet about the debate. I will not subtweet about the debate. #DebateNight
Has Clinton got an autocue on her podium? She looks down every 2 blooming seconds! #debatenight
Apologies for the folks who drink every time Trump randomly name-drops Reagan. Steel your livers. #debatenight
He doesn't do ads because he's trying to save money? Is that what he said? #debates
"I've made good relations with the black community Over the last little while" 🙄 Jesus take the wheel.... Smh #debatenight
The Democratic in this debate seems like she is grasping at straws and bringing up very petty things #debatenight
My 4 year old thinks #trump is mean, and the 2 year old tried to hand him a storm trooper! #futurevoters #ImWithHer #debatenight
Holy shit. Trump is getting the shit kicked out of him. #Debates2016
Okay but what about before what about before he was running for President #DebateNight
Does he know that African Americans live in the same communities as white people? #Debatenight
OOOH "As soon as she releases (the 30,000 deleted emails), I'll release my tax returns" #debatenight
#debatenight @HillaryClinton: His "cavalier attitude" about nuclear weapons, should scare us (Saudi, Japan, Korea can all have them).
#DEBATES2016 We don't LET them bring, them back!? really? LET THEM? Ask Apple how they Ireland and the EU are doing with that, right now?
#DEBATES2016 Yes... you take care of yourself Trump... How does that translate to you taking care of U.S.?
#DEBATES2016 Donald routinely disrespects the Muslim community.... He wants to impose a Religious test for entrance into the U.S.?
Opp. Donald put his foot in his mouth again . " We've become a 3rd world country 🌍🙄" #DumpTrump #debatenight
"Sure, I might've said in an interview with Howard Stern that I was for the war, but I didn't mean it!" CRAWL BACK INTO YOUR HOLE. #debates
"I take advantage of the laws" is not a great line.  #debates #sniff
If this guy becomes our president and interrupts leaders at a world meeting....😅 #debatenight
Is Trump auditioning to be the new Bane? Get this dude an inhaler! #Debates2016
Stop &amp; Frisk... Racial profiling at its worst &amp; Donald is arguing the "very anti police" judge didnt strike it down... #lies #debatenight
This blow-by-blow of a (probably made up) phone call is absurd #debatenight
HRC: "The vibrancy of the black church..." DT: "Ugh..."  ..........! #debatenight
Mad respect for actually not shying away from criminal justice reform #debatenight
"I HAVE A TREMENDOUS INCOME" is my fav thing to scream as I run through port authority.  #PresidentialDebate #debatenight
@Francinewade87 Exactly. How is making LAX better going to better the economy or help race relations or gun control? #HowSway #Debates2016
How does Clinton keep from squinting at Trump while he's talking?  #debatenight #Debates2016
Try a day with unarmed guards and then come talk to me @HillaryClinton #debatenight
New debate drinking game: anytime either one speaks, drink bleach. It's the same as either of them winning #Cuban2016 #Debates
"It doesn't work that way" says the man who is the KING of changing his ideas of a fact. #DebateNight
Somebody needs to find Hillary up. She's running out of steam #Debates
#Drumpf: "blah blah blah, believe me... blah blah" American people: "what was the question again?"  #Debates2016
#trump had to have spent 2 hrs min on that rat nest on his head today. #debatenight
That proves what a brainless moron u r @seangrandillo if u overlook her criminal lawlessness &amp; "classified" security understanding. #debates
Trump sounds passionate..  Hillary sounds rehearsed...  Because they are..  #Debates2016
I wish Hillary had a chance to speak without Trump screeching over her. #putamuzzleonhim #debatenight
Not examining "why I am feeling this way" = deadly consequences YES.  #Debates
There is literally nowhere in this country where 'our police are outgunned,' Hillary Clinton #Debates2016
Does Trump still own the Miss America pageant or just take his political answers from its contestants? #debatenight #Debates2016
I wonder if we can delete Hilary like she deleted those emails🤔 #debatenight  #TrumpVsHillary
#Hillary: 'If you are too dangerous to fly, you are too dangerous to buy a gun.' #easy.  #debatenight
If you still support Donald Trump after this #debatenight I think you are a disgrace.
#DebateNight Hillary will do everything in her power to support ISIS. Look at what she did to set them up in Syria and Libya!
Oh goodness, the race conversation is about to happen. In the name of Jesus, I rebuke the spirit of ignorance off my timeline. #Debates
he said she said and then he said that she said. wtf dude #debatenight
Crazy that both of these people have gotten so far  #Debates2016
So basically Donald Trump wants us to be the world's bodyguards for hire? #Debates2016
Do you think the fact checkers are also playing the drinking game? #debatenight
@HillaryClinton is the one who voted in favor of war in Iraq #debatenight
Catching the live taping. They have us watching the debates first. No anti-nausea meds have been provided #lssc #lateshowlive
i wish i could watch this in place of history class , i'd have a nice 100 🤘🏾#debates
I just told @nbcwashington that those 2 idiots are not adequate and that Obama should get a 3rd term. Cast your vote now! #Debates
The probably is all I’m seeing whenever Trump talks is Jimmy Fallon  #Sniff  #DebateNight
"It's terrible what's going on in Chicago--I have property there!" Trump only cares about his own assets. #Debates2016
If Trump blames anyone but himself for the #birther movement, I'm going to snap. #Debates2016
"Knock the hell out of ISIS" -- Trump legit has no idea how military operations work. #Debates2016
Does Donald Trump even know what the word "unconstitutional" means?  #debatenight #debates #Debates2016
Clinton: Trump accused me of preparing for this debate. I also prepared to be President. #debates #Debate2016 #debatenight
Trump is Pro-Russian. This is a fact. Out of his own mouth he continuously supports Putin&amp;Russia's Failed States's tactics.  #debates
How many times has he interrupted Hillary and Lester?! 20-30 times, right?  But he has a winning temperament?!  🙄😑 #debatenight
Trump is such a shit show, my cat just leaned in and drank my wine. #debatenight
Last camera shot better be on Lester saying "Live From New York! #Debates2016
What does one taxes has to do with running for President? I still don't get it...  #Debates2016

YUGE oversight by Donald Trump to not slam Clinton crime bill here. Huge. Tactical mistake. #debates
Secretaries of States don't take out terrorists or Osama Bin Laden. #debates
Trump now detailing his own financial history. "I'll give you a list of banks."  #Debates
#DebateNight Is the birther issue Trump's First Political Activity? I seem to remember FULL PAGE ADS in NYC back in the 80's! #FactCheck
The only debate I'm having right now is between opening this Double IPA or this Dopplebock. #debatenight
Holt: "Let's talk about race."  Trump: "Sure, just lemme tie my shoe." [uses escape hatch]  #debatenight #debates #Debates2016
Braggadocio, the Pemiscot County hamley named for a horse thief, applauds @realDonaldTrump coining #Braggadocious #debatenight #ShowMe
All Donald Trump had to do was seem presidential. Instead he doubled down. #debatenight
this shit he says reminds me of when @colbertlateshow has a trump vs. trump debate #debates
Trump is just naming random gov't institutions and blaming them for what ever he can think of... #Debates2016
@DonaldTrump brings up defeating ISIS &amp; #LesterHolt cares more about Obama's "hurt feelings." Seriously??? #debates #debatenight
Watch @realDonaldTrump answer. Will not make any sense! He always makes everything about himself #Debates
Yes you you you!!!! People you wouldn't even look at if not running for president #Debates
They are all his close friends yes yes ok. Ok...  #Debates
so why am i almost sure that third world countries don't even have freaking have airports #Debates
#debatenight is about to make the #GreenParty numbers grow yet again, #SteinBaraka have the support from 45% of the country, no 2-party trap
@lesterholtnbc is going big on the race issues tonight, and hammering the birthed issue #debates2016
The best part of this debate, are the people laughing in the audience after Trump says something #debatenight
I can't even keep up with twitter tonight.  You all are going in!!!!!#Debates2016 #PresidentialDebate
I don't want to think about the debates or what either of the possible futures could be so I'm not coming back until it's all over
Trump slams Hillary for using...a label? 'Trump economics' struck a cord with Trump boy. Who came up with that?? He says😂😂 #debatenight
I have worked for people like thrump. You want hours? Ok well we are slow right now so go home. #Debates2016 #eattherich
Back on the stop and frisk. Thrump really only gives a shit about NYC. Make weed legal in the city and wtch murders drop to 0. #Debates2016
#debatenight Drinking Game  Drink every time the mediator reminds @realDonaldTrump what the question was  Odds are you'll die in an hour
My god he's like that jock bully in high school who just won't shut up! 😬 #Debates2016 #DumpTrump #ImWithHer
"We need law and order"... In this debate, step it up Holt #debatenight

Where are we? Is this earth? Is @realDonaldTrump really defending racial profiling? Is this rally happening? #Debates2016
Texts from my dad pt 3: "Suit, made in Sri Lanka. Tie, made in China. Flag pin, made in Vietnam. Make America great again!" #Debates2016
"Do better at cyber" what is this cyber you speak of? #debatenight
I cannot believe how much Trump is beating her. This is shocking. #debatenight #debates
#Debates2016: "nuh uh, yer lyinggg" "noooo you areeee"....."MAAAAAA, she won't stop lyingggg"
Do you think there's actually anyone left in that arena, or is it just that quiet because they all left? #Debates2016
I wanna know if Hillary relates to women in the sense being that she doesn't shave her legs for a week also? #Debates2016
Wish Clinton would hit back @ Trump when he has  unscripted reactions. Or am I just getting infected by trumpism, thnx sexism #debates
Most nervous person at this debate is Lester. Lester did not ask for this #Debates2016
You gotta ask yourself: if I were V. Putin, which candidate would I want to face on a showdown/crisis? #Debates2016 #ThinkAboutIt
"We did ask you to be silent." The moment @LesterHoltNBC took it back.  #debates
Lester wanna tough talk the audience but he don't have shit to say to Trump. #debatenight
That man said he was pro stop and frisk on national tv.. #debatenight
Trump can't do a debate without having a temper tantrum but he's going to run the most powerful nation on earth? #debates
Can someone please shop a MJ crying face to Lester Holt? Plz and thx. #debates
DT: My strongest asset is my temperament. I'm howling here!! Glad HC is sticking to the facts and not digressing like he is #debatenight
Negligently handling classified materials is not "a good thing" &amp; horrible way to "prepare to be President." #DebateNight #ClintonEmails
Most of the 1% Like Hillary and Donald don't pay taxes. They have charitable organizations they hide $$$$ in  #debatenight  #debates
I'm pretty sure Trumps candidacy is a long commercial for Trump Enterprises. It must be fake. #debatenight #debates #PresidentialDebate
WE TALKING ABOUT THESE EMAILS AGAIN????? Yo her email must have that Kanye &amp; Drake collab album #debatenight
Hey Trump? Maybe if you paid your Federal taxes we'd have better roads, bridges and airports...just a thought #debatenight #debates
"How about a list of very nice banks instead of those tax returns? Also, our airports are not nice."-Donald J. Trump #Debates2016
So basically he doesn’t see a need for racial healing and he’s saying WE are the problem. Got it #Debate2016 #Debatenight
Miss me with the I was against the Iraq 2-3 years after it was started #debatenight
Did @realDonaldTrump's handlers tell him to keep cutting in like a child in an argument? #Debates2016
Mac-Headline 2months from now: Saying WRONG repeatedly will get you voted into the White House. #debatenight
I will say this… Secretary Clinton as a country yes crimes are down... But the crime in the inner cities are still happening...#debatenight
Trump has been sued over 3500 times!! You must be doing something wrong!! Liberal state of mind! #Debates2016
@HillaryClinton has termites in her smile.-- &amp; red lipstick all over her teeth. #Debates2016
Restarting "Stop &amp; Frisk" will up the racial profiling claims by thousands!! #debatenight #debates #Debates2016
just walked past the tv and farted on Trump's half of the screen. surely a historic moment I will tell my grandchildren one day #debatenight
#debatenight Hillary is the very definition of 'class': Grace Under Pressure'. Keep it up. Trump looks like a rattled mess.
It is completely inexcusable that Hillary did not start fighting ISIS from the point of conception #debatenight
Is he name-dropping or playing the blame game?  I can't even. #debatenight
Hillary just says "She's prepared for the debate  and that's 🔥🔥🔥😂#debatenight #PresidentialDebate #HillaryClinton
If LAX is a third world country then what are actual third world countries? #Debates
"We've become a third-world country" says @realDonaldTrump. Spoken like someone who hasn't seen much of the world. #debatenight
Trump looks over at Hillary like a little boy looks at his sister who has two scoops of ice cream and he only has one scoop. #Debates2016
Someone is inside Trump’s podium shining his shoes throughout the entire debate and hopefully tying his shoestrings together. #debates2016
Trump's description of airports shows he doesn't have a clue what the Third World is like. #debatenight
Clinton is responsible for jailing more young black men than anyone in history.  #Debates
Drumpf is totally off the rails what the hell is this debate #debatenight
This god damn moderator for this #debatenight is a jackass black who spouts the same crap as the moronic BLM welfare assholes
Oh snap, birtherism rears it's ugly head, and Trump lies and lies and lies and lies.  #debatenight #Debates2016
Donald, No Admission of Guilt! Oh he is melting down!! #debatenight #Debates2016 Holy shit are my eyes witnessing this?
Trump needs some bundles added in the front of his hair.. 🤔😭 #DebateNight
Why are we having to listen to Trump talking about hanging out with Sean Hannity? #debates
Trump you cut off people's water supply so they'd move away from your golf course in Scotland!! #debatenight #Debates2016 #debates
Absolutely no IRS issues with releasing tax returns, reality is he doesn't pay them #Debates
We don't need more Law and Order, that shit has been on for like 17 seasons 😂 #debates #debatenight
"Bait and switch" is the most flattering way of putting it #Debates2016
I think Obama should just use his authority to release Trump's returns. #debatenight
Hillary pandering and ignoring the real crime that exists in our largest cities. #debatenight
Trump predictably dodges the question on race, endorsing #stopandfrisk and #lawandorder with no understanding #racialprofiling #debatenight
I SAY NOTHING said @realDonaldTrump OMG "I've developed good relationships with African Americans #debatenight
I thought I was watching The Purge the election year.  #debatenight
Lester bring it back to Race and healing the divide  #debatenight
Everything is Obama’s fault. Sit down @realDonaldTrump Good job @LesterHoltNBC call him on his sh..it. #debates
@HillaryClinton can be a raving bitch, but that’s no different than @realDonaldTrump and his rants and bad bullish behavior. #debates
apparently one of the jobs Trump is going to create is one for his hacker son #debatenight
he's not saying anything? but so many words are coming out of his mouth rn #debatenight
I'm Cdn &amp; know stop &amp; frisk was unconstitutional. How come @realDonaldTrump who's running for president doesn't? Wake up USA!#debatenight
"a man who gets provoked by a tweet shouldn't have his finger on the nuclear button" BOOM Hillary. Yas! #debatenight
Hold on - I’m spending seconds of my life listening to HRC lecture me on the world of cyber - WTF???  #Debates #Debates2016 #DebateNight
"Look at the mess we're in" So you see this, too? #Debates
I tracked down Obama's BC because I wanted to fight ISIS... k #debatenight
Trump's gonna need more water. Maybe Rubio will bring it to him #debates
All @realDonaldTrump said 'they are leaving usa' to every question, its the same cliche! #debatenight #presedentialdebate #HillaryClinton
"No wonder you've been fighting #ISIS your entire life" - #Trump says to #Clinton for having her anti-ISIS plan on website #DebateNight
OMG IT literally sounded like @realDonaldTrump said "I was just endorsed by #ISIS" 😂😂😂 #debatenight #Debates2016
Trump running for president doesn't care about the constitutionality of law.  #debatenight
Hillary traveled a zillion miles, every country! Donald said she "stays home" #Debates #sniffles
-did Trump just a) claim it wasn't Russia that hacked the DNC and b) throw in a gratuitous fat joke to boot #debatenight
#Debates2016 nobody wants to call Shawn. Sniff. Snort. Ohhhhh man, u didn't hear what I'm SAYYYYYYn man.
Clinton has already dignified this crazy birth certificate thin with too many words. #debatenight
Can we talk about real issues and not birth certificates?  #debatenight
This is a joke America, right? You wouldn't seriously put this fascist in office? He's not a "normal guy" at all.  #debatenight
Just like Obama produced his birth certificate, YOU Mr. Trump... SHOULD PRODUCE YOUR TAX RETURNS!!! #Debates2016
#debatenight where everyone pretends they care about politics by using funny snapchat filters on the candidates &amp; adding it to their stories
"That is the way I feel"...um, that's irrelevent, Mr. Trump. It's not about feelings... #Debates
"We can't just say Law and Order" thank you, Hilliary  #debatenight
#Obama approval numbers are lightyears above both #Hillary's &amp; #Trump's, I'm not sure tying her with him is winning strategy #debatenight
#Trump actually thinks saying he has better temperament makes him have better temperament, as if no one is watching this 😂😂😂 #debatenight
I wish Lester Holt had a mic kill switch for each time Trump or Clinton went over their alloted time.  #debates
The record shows you're wrong. Lmao. But keep pointing at it! Hope people look! #Debates2016
We are supposed to take a sovereign country's resources? Someone tell Trump that colonialism is over &amp; we are dealing w/ it #debatenight
We can have better airports when you pay taxes you moron #debatenight
This needed to be called out: "Sometimes what happens in business would be really bad in government" #debatenight
We have gangs roaming the streets'-Donald Trump.  Does he mean the Police? #blacktwitter #debatenight #BlackVotesMatter #blacklivesmatter
Yeah it's easy to be under budget when you don't pay your invoices. #Debates2016
The only way to create jobs is for the government to get out of the way by cutting regulation. #debates2016 #debates
Would someone please take the shovel out of Donald Trump's hands.  He is digging even deeper. #debates #Debates2016
Y'all...@realDonaldTrump is tweeting his ass off AND debating #HillaryClinton. How is he doing this? 😂😂😂  #debatenight #debates #Debates2016
Donald Trump does not give a fuck about this COUNTRY. He gives a fuck about BUSINESS &amp; HIMSELF. #Debates2016
If after watching this #debate you still believe Clinton and Trump are equally terrible, you're delusional. #debatenight
Who's running the @twitter handles of @realDonaldTrump and @HillaryClinton while this debate is going? #debates #DebateNight 🇺🇸🇺🇸
Why are we talking about Sean Hannity? #debatenight #debates #Debates2016 #FactCheckTheDebate #DebateNight People are laughing in disgust
Thank you Lester. Stop and Frisk is not the answer Trump. #Debates2016
#debatenight Stick a fork in Trump.  "everybody refuses to talk to Sean Hannity" The Bully has arrived 100 percent.
Bro we don't want your income. We want your tax statements #debatenight
The wealthy will save the wprld. #Trump is telling on y he's not sharing his tax statmnts. Offshore undeclared income #Debates
Maybe if I just interrupt her and say WRONG WRONG then I'll win. --said no successful debater ever #debates
Hillary just said, 'But let's talk about the question you asked, Lester!' Great idea. Trump should try that! #debatenight
I would rather learn about policy than learn about how much their competitor sucks. #debatenight
Did he just suggest that Debbie Wasserman Schultz is a hacker? #debates
@katyperry @katyperry I love seeing u talk like this; we taught u well😌 #debatenight
Trump lecturing Clinton on being disrespectful to her past competitors in debates - irony lol
#Debates why is Trump sniffling so much? Thoughts? I won't say it.
I didn't realize they moved Saturday Night Live to Monday nights... #debatenight
This is a travesty! #Debates2016 Truly a hoke!  How can Trump have no points 9tger than slamming Obama and Clinton?
This is the best America has to offer for this job? Shame on us! #Debates
#debatenight Um it's Obama's fault black men are getting shot in Chicago #?  Say what?
"You don't learn that much from tax returns." @realDonaldTrump I'm willing to bet the IRS might disagree.  #ReleaseYourTaxes #Debates2016
Lester Holt balls just dropped apparently, finally calling out Trump on his lies #debatenight
It's like watching a tenured professor with 30 years of experience and a doctorate fight with Spicoli. #Debates2016 #momsagainsttrump
DONALD TRUMP DOESN'T KNOW ISIS FORMED IN 1999 HE IS A PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE DEAR GOD HELP US ALL #Debates2016
#DebateNight Law and order? That easy, ha? Bad people. Take away their guns. 🙄
Come on, we need a moderator with some cajones to tell these people to STFU. #debatenight
But really, we should be feeling bad that no one calls Sean Hannity #debatenight
Trump opposed the Iraq war, but thinks we should've kept all the oil. SMH #debates2016
Trump will wage war on Terrier. Who let the dogs out? #DebateNight
Neither Clinton or Trump answered that race question...... Smh I'm thoroughly disappointed #Debates
Way to go Lester, the birther issue is really a top priority to running a country.  #debatenight
The purpose of these debates is to sway UNDECIDED voters but I don't understand being torn between Clinton and Trump 🤔
Masterful indictment of his impulsivity &amp; reactivity with his "I'll start a war cuz the Iranians are rude" stupidity. #debatenight #debates
"I have a winning temperament. I know how to win."  #debatenight #ThatsNotWhatWinningTemperamentMeansDonald
I feel like Donald Trump can emit the cadences of a logical argument, but not the actual logic. #debatenight
What a joke. Nixon released his taxes while being audited. All show, no substance. #nevertrump #debatenight
Do we think the person "sitting on their bed that weighs 400 pounds" is voting for this schmuck or ?????? #ImWithHer #WOW #Debates2016
My favething is the crowd LAUGHING at him as he says he has a better temperment than Hillary WHILE HE RANTS #ImWithHer #Debates2016 #debates
okay I'm pretty sure Donald Trump leaned forward just to breathe into the mic that time #debatenight #debates
Why is he asking her to release confidential emails that they're mad were compromised to begin with? #Debates2016
Had to take a pee break  What did i miss? #debatenight
"My strongest asset is my temperament" my favorite Trump quote so far. #debatenight
Someone plllllleeeeeeaaaaase get Trump a tissue. Help an old boy out. #sniffles #debatenight #Debates2016
Best line of the night: A man who can provoked by a tweet should not have his hands anywhere near nuclear codes. #debatenight #Debates2016
Trump - he of Lyin' Ted, Little Marco, and Low-Energy Jeb - just criticized Hillary for being disrespectful of a primary opponent. #Debates
And sweet potatoes are easy to cook. All you need is a paper towel and a microwave. #debatenight #debates #debates2016
My mom and I used to watch Little House on The Prairie. They considered sweet potatoes a treat. So do I. #debatenight #debates #debates2016
Listening to @HillaryClinton education bin Foreign Policy. @realDonaldTrump is a PSA for anti-bully programming #debatenight
Trump: I have A SHIT TON OF MONEY! So can you!!! #StopTheTrumpTrain #Debates2016 #factcheck #DebateNIght #ImWithHer
Trump: "I haven't thought a lot about NATO." We're weeks away from a new prez. Dont ya think its time to start? #debatenight
What about @SenSanders for prez instead? Or Michelle Obama? or just not one of those two? #debates #Debates2016 #debatenight #dkpol
All I'm getting from this is that Trump wants to create an army of cyborgs. #debatenight
Crowd LAUGHS when he says he has a better temperament. Wow. I'm terrified. #debatenight
When is somebody going to nail Hillary on the birther lie? #debatenight #Debates2016
I think he purposely got sick to try for sympathy. On the other hand, death could be imminent. #debatenight
so, stop wasting 20 minutes of my night talking about it and Donald release your taxes and Hilary release the emails. #debates #blahblahblah
Stock market looks great. Job market looks great. But it's a "big ugly bubble." Damned if you do... #debates
#Trump can I have a small loan of 7mil, I'm trying to pay off my student loan and maybe start a business #PresidentialDebate #Debates2016
HRC: Maybe Trump doesn't want people to know he paid nothing in federal taxes Trump: "That makes me smart." #debatenight
I don't think Trump understands what Lester is talking about with the First Use question. I know, shocking. #debatenight
#Debates2016 #DebateNight Trump continues to lie about his support of the invasion of Iraq. He's pathetic continuing to lie.
Fact check: braggadocious is a true word. One real thing from @realDonaldTrump #debatenight
"It's all words it's all soundbites" - Trump describing his entire campaign #debatenight
Those kindly rich people that just can't get rid of their tax havens and give money to the inner cities like they want to. #Debates2016
Lol trump said he has a good temperament...... yeah and I'm 6ft tall 😴😴😴😴😒🙄#debatenight
Trump can use that super predator term all he wants. Black ppl, ESPECIALLY YOUNG BLACK PPL, will not vote for him. #Debates
This isn't a debate, it's let's call out Trump on his lies and ignore Hillary's lies #debatenight
"You can release taxes during an audit." "I've already said I'll release them after the audit." That's not even a clever dodge. #debatenight
Wait...did Drumpf just say we're a third-world country because he's been to nicer airports in other countries? #debatenight
- this is what happens when friends run for the same position ..  #debatenight
Donald Trump is the epitome of "I WAS TOLD BY APPLECARE!!" whenever the moderator tries to move on. #debates
This is a very, very far cry from Trump's bitchslapping of the other GOP candidates. He's getting owned over and over again. #debatenight
To answer a Q abt race relations, Trump has said bring back law &amp; order and that African Americans are living in hell. Wow. #debatenight
Trump explaining his being for and against the Iraq war was not a good moment for him. #debatenight
The President should not tell or force states to end private prisons #tcot #debatenight
Wish I could ask Trump and Hillary if they would pressure Congress to pass a new AUMF to fight ISIS #cspanchat #tcot #debatenight
HRC: "policing can have literally fatal consequences" - need to retrain police officers to address implicit bias. oh hey #debatenight
#Debates2016 ladies and gentlemen our next president @realDonaldTrump  wow he is dominating.with no mock draft I mean prep..#TrumpPence16
#Debates2016 @HillaryClinton  no making any excuses .....I think top  emails and Benghazi attack  are far more important tan Tax returns
Completely inappropriate to say this about Nucs and who should fight whom. fear-mongering not your job tonight.  #debatenight
Clinton on Trump: "Maybe he's not as rich as he says he is.'' Trump looking exasperated on taxes; head down; #debatenight
You serious?? @realDonaldTrump.  You are the problem-  you incite Russian hacking and racial violence-  #debates
The NRA are great people protecting second amendment. I love this. What about the Civil Rights Act? The 14-16th Amendments? #Debates2016
@RoisinF NOPE - He is always a victim. It's always someone else's fault. Women, hispanics, blacks, muslims #debates
Are you proud of not admitting guilt? So you are proud of getting away? #debatenight #debates
Most, if not all, settlement agreements include a clause that neither party is admitting to any bit of guilt. #debatenight
Come on Lester, get law and order at the debate..2 minutes! #Debates2016 #debates
Trump: LOUD MOUTH WORDS (GARBLE GARBLE FACIAL EXPRESSION) Clinton: Compassionate, thoughtful plans and solutions for problems  #Debates2016
Hillary said it. Presidency requires diplomacy. Trump is too real for diplomacy.  #debatenight
I'm not an economist, but I'm pretty sure you can't have a "bad recovery" and a "bubble." #Debates2016
He was asked about his birthed theories...how did he get on ISIS? #DebateNight
She's literally slaying his bluster &amp; shouty interruptions with calm, rational fact. 😮☺️ #debates
Donald Trump keeps talking about overweight people like he's built like Shaun T. #Trump's overweight too so he should be quiet. #debatenight
#DebateNight WTF how much BS &amp; hate can Trump pack into an hour?
give the country to the big mad pants-pissing baby boy, i want to see what happens #debatenight
Donald Trump said he has better temperament than HRC and the room fucking laughed. #DebateNight
@HFA #debatenight Let's remember #Trump took out a full page ad to put 5 innocent boys to death in Central Pk case.
"I haven't thought much about NATO" just came out of the mouth of a Pres candidate #debatenight
@JCoker33 @AtlantaFalcons I must admit I watched the first quarter but then got roped in to the #debates
"I have a much better temperament than she does." Clinton and the audience fail to keep a straight face. #DebateNight
LESTER: We are talking about racial healing. DONALD: Anyway, back to me.  #debatenight #debates
#StopAndFrisk worked?!?! for who? Should I get out my freeman papers too? #debatenight #BlackLivesMatter
"My lawyers said don't do it " le gars ci heinnn #debatenight
The real loser tonight is Lester Holt. Not up to the task. #debatenight
Stop telling us who endorses you and actually give us real fucking plans for your presidency. #debates
Trump is looking weak on Tax issue; foreign policy is much stronger   #debatenight
lol "common sense gun safety measures would help us."  Jesus christ Hillary, name the blacks  #debatenight
"I have a 10 year old son he's so good with these computers."  New prodigy, excellent  #debatenight
Donald Trump just said "why not" to blaming Hillary for literally everything #debatenight
Trump keeping the conversation on supporting the war in Iraq is a great move. HRC VOTED FOR IT! #debatenight
LOL Hillary talking about cyber security, and how hackers are a threat 😂MAYBE TO YOU MS.CLINTON &amp; YOUR EMAIL SERVER + THE DNC #debatenight
you know when you start a story and then keep talking in circles cuz you don't know what you're talking about? #debatenight
I'm going to call Sean Hannity and see who i should vote for.  #Debates2016
hillary clinton, shoving a skeleton back in her closet: "i just think he has something to hide!" #debatenight
to be fair, the fossil record does show that donald trump was against the iraq war during the cambrian explosion #debates
Calling all 400 pound hackers sitting on their beds #debates Lord help us
Ok well if he doesn't think that blowing an Iranian ship out of the water would start a war...now I'm actually scared #Debates2016
"I have a much better temperament than she does." --@realDonaldTrump  "HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA" --otherwise silent audience  #debatenight #debates
#debatenight trickle down didn't work it gave us 2008 crash. Thank you Hilary! finally!
Trump is losing, but if anyone will gain after tonight it will be him. #debates
"I'm talking about taking guns from people who use them". -Trump #DebateNight
A routine audit does not prevent you from releasing your tax returns. #debatenight
Donald just casually fat shaming hypothetical DNC hackers for fun I guess? #debatenight
"I care because I have property there..." Glad to see the humanity showing through.  #Debates
#debatenight "we need law and order" Me: omg you love that show too??!!
Yeah... There's no rule in which the IRS is preventing Trump from releasing tax returns while "under audit" #Debates
While there's substantial weight to Hillary's gun stance, it's not just about the supply in guns.Demand needs to be addressed, too. #debates
Trump doesn't have the smarts nor the patience to be the head of a Real Estate dept. in govt. let alone being the next POTUS #Debates2016
TRUMP: We have to bring back law and order. Talks about benefits of Stop and Frisk policy in New York City.   #kmov #debatenight
😂 RT @ShamaraOnline: Secretary @HillaryClinton its your fault that Brad &amp; Angelina done  #debatenight
"Obamas a man of great dignity" no he's a man who put men in the ladies room #debatenight
Wesley Snipes,  according to Trump's logic,  is one of the smartest people alive... #debates
Facts!!! RT @marshawnevans: If I gotta pay taxes....a candidate for president sho'nuff gotta pay taxes.  #debatenight
Trump said Hillary didn't want to use the word "law," but she used it multiple times in the statement he was referring to. #DebateNight
Hillary has to distract with lies on her awful record on Libya and Iraq. #debatenight
Trump's preparation for the debate: bait and switch then fear mongering. #debatenight
Does anyone realize that @HillaryClinton has make-up caked onto her face and looks like a sick clown? #debatenight #MAGA #Debates2016
Trump: "I've been under audit for 15 years" because I'm a fucking fraud. #Debates2016
Trump just re-endorsed stop &amp; frisk! Never mind a judge found it UNCONSTITUTIONAL. #Debates2016
"I demanded his birth certificate like a racist and the living embodiment of a spray tanned penis" - Trump #debatenight
Some bad things.  That's as detailed a program as @realdonaldtrump can come up with.   #debatenight
Ibuprofen + Tylenol + HRC slaying. I don't even miss my stupid old tooth. #debatenight
I like to name people, things I've seen on tv, amounts of $$. #debatenight
I could have sword @realDonaldTrump just said "I was just endorsed by ISIS." #debatenight
Donald Trump is the single greatest threat this country has, actually. #debatenight
Is Hilary here to endorse her website and her book or does she want to run a country #debatenight
The fact she hasn't leapt over that podium and choked the life out of him, proves she has the better temperament. #debatenight #TeamHillary
Trump indirectly called inner city minorities felons... this is shaping up to be a good debate #debatenight
Trump is going off the rails. Just sentence fragments. Rattled as hell and lashing out with bullying. #Debates
Wasting time on his support or not for Iraq war. Lester, please move it along!! #debates
I feel so bad for the moderator tbh bc he's just trying to run the debate and he has to put up with these Children™ #debatenight
Hilary: I prepared for this debate and I prepared to be President Applause #debatenight
I do the best cyber! I have the best cyber! I will make the US so great in cyber. 😂 He has no idea what that word means. #debates2016
Quote of the night, courtesy of Emily Galvin "Screw the #debates, I'm watching #WWERaw. More evenly matched fights, more believable."
It would have been nice if one of the networks had a #MNF ticker with fantasy stats on the screen. #debatenight #Debates2016
HillaryClinton: "Trump just criticized me for preparing for this debate. You know what else I prepared for? Being president." #DebateNight
Ok, to be fair though Trump needs to let her finish her responses, even if they are all complete &amp; total lies.  #debatenight
"Stop and frisk was ruled unconstitutional in New York," Lester Holt says. "No, you're wrong." Donald Trump responds. #debatenight #debates…
Actually...Aug 12, 2013, U.S. District Court Judge Shira Scheindlin ruled that the stop and frisk practice was unconstitutional #debatenight
trump you forgot to accuse the hispanics of 'taking advantage' of bernie  #Debates
Yo everytime I watch Trump talk I deadass get so mad 😂😂😒😒 #Debates
"It is really unfortunate that he paints such a dire picture of black communities." #DebateNight
Donald trump just said he had a better temperament than Hilary hahahah #debatenight
I wish I could send the IRS a, "financial statement of sorts." #Debates2016 #releaseyourtaxreturns
#debatenight ATTN DONALD TRUMP: IRS has REPEATEDLY said U CAN release ur tax returns even under audit. Stop the lies!
#debatenight ATTN DONALD: The Republicans voted against banning people on terrorist watch list from buying guns.
#debatenight If Donald says Hillary started the lies about Obama being from Kenya? Who is he kidding? He is such a liar I can't stand it!
#debatenight Clearly Trump has memorized a few obscure names hes tossing in &amp; throwing the occasional Yeman in there 2. Late nite cramming
Plot twist: What if we send ISIS to Mexico and give them jobs? Then what?! Huh?! #DebateNight
"Well I have much better judgement than she does. I also have a much better temperament than she does" excuse me whaaaaa  #debates
#debatenight Hilary to Trump- "We all know you live in your own reality Donald" so true
Trump, known for doing business with Gaddafi, says Libya was Clinton fault. *scratches head* #debates #debatenight
Hopefully Trump is losing voters just from all the sniffling he's doing #SickTrump #Debates
Would it not be cool if there was a little buzzer that rings every time they go off track or lie #debatenight
Ok no THIS must be the publicity stunt staged by the makers of the "It" remake. #Debates2016 #debatenight
Explaining things to Hillary in terms of "murder" because that's a term she's familiar with #debatenight
But when can we learn the nothing that @realDonaldTrump tax returns will reveal? You said it's nothing so release them #debatenight
With all this quiet time for Lester he could be filling out a new voter registration card with party change. #debatenight
This by far has to be the easiest #debates that @HillaryClinton will ever be in. All she has to do is let him talk!
Trump refuses to believe that stop and frisk was ruled unconstitutional because it was racial profiling. #Debates2016
You could cut the sexual tension with a knife! Kiss already! #debatenight
#Trump's only policy thus far seems to be tax cuts for the rich, also known as trickle down economics. Works, if you're rich. #Debates2016
Is snifflegate a thing yet? When does that become a thing? #debates
Trump using buzz words rather than actually laying out his plan. #debatenight
"I HAVE THE BEST TEMPERAMENT! SHUT UP ALSO WHAT IS TEMPERAMENT"  #debatenight
Ya know how Trump said he didn't do any debate prep? And everyone was like, "he's just saying that!" -- he wasn't kidding! #Debates2016
Did Trump really just say he has a winning temperament? LOL. #debatenight
This is dragging. Next, let's move it along. Lester Holt. You're fired. #Debates2016
Same sad song with these two lol. Tax returns &lt;&gt; Emails  #debatenight
Moderator: "Why am I even here? You guys keep interrupting me and avoiding my questions." #debatenight
What's sad is that every woman has encountered someone like Donald Trump when they're trying to speak with honestly and dignity #Debates2016
.@PoliticusSarah that was only a tip of the iceberg, he doubled down on a lot of crazy tonight. #debates #debates2016
They both keep talking AROUND the race issue!!!!!! ANSWER THE FREAKIN QUESTION!!!! #DebateNight
a better temperament? DT has been jabbing/dehumanizing all night. eye rolling. interrupting Holt. can't stand to be critiqued. #debatenight
hey @realDonaldTrump I think you look like a big, fat, ugly bubble  #Debates
Trump and Clinton have NO respect for one another, and it shows. Be civil! #debatenight @realDonaldTrump @HillaryClinton
I really want to know what Trump is gonna say about race besides bashing Hillary and saying she's wrong #debatenight
@BitsieTulloch he also said "I say nothing" earlier...For once I agree with him. Trump's answers have no substance, ever. #debatenight
LOL @ Obama not being America coming up in #DebateNight Like... America is a big joke.
"We've become a third world country" I want to personally take you to a developing country and watch you choke on your words #debates
you want to bring in 1,000's of refugees... that's NOT protecting us here in the US @HillaryClinton! #debatenight  #Debates  #Debates2016
Trump says he has a much better temperament than Hillary - crowd roars with laughter.   #Debates2016 #debatenight #debates
I can't vote for someone who can't follow the rules on a debate. #debatenight
I wonder what stats Donald will pull out of his ass about race. #debatenight
On the other hand, Trump is continually grasping at straws and sniffling because his head's more full of mucus than grey matter #debates2016
Trump announces rat face von fuck twit as leader of the NSA cause he's so good at computers #debatenight
Now she's making it real, bringing it down to the people who have suffered instead of taking shots, more like this. #debatenight #ImWithHer
When it comes to policy and laws.. trump seems to be very quite and almost has not interrupted #debates2016 #fucktrump
The only Law &amp; Order I want to hear about is the one with Olivia Benson (and maybe Stabler?!) #debates
Networks offering split screen #debatenight. More focus on reactions than candidates' messages?
The US is a 3rd world country? If it's based on Drumpf's own candidacy in these elections, I can see where he's coming from. #debatenight
“If we just colonized the world, there would be no terrorism”  “But the question was about home-grown—”  “No terrorism.”   #DebateNight
Most people would say "I was innocent", not "with no admission of guilt" @realDonaldTrump  #debatenight #debates
"We have to bring communities together..." -@HillaryClinton   And SHE is the one to do it. #YDOvotes #Debates2016
There are better debates going in barbershops, what they bout to talk about next how the warriors lost up 3-1 #debatenight
Why are we talking about this birther crap! Lets move on #debatenight
If for no other reason, #ImWithHer for her very mature ability to NOT roll her eyes at this buffoonery. #debatenight
I love how in our modern world Twitter is lit during the debate #debatenight
" Sometimes what's good for business isn't good for government " #debatenight
Trump has used "I guess...I think...something like that" way too much #debatenight
Needing a pat on the back for not being racist is so fucking racist #debatenight
I opened a club in probably the wealthiest community in the world and there's absolutely no racism there. Yay me. #Trump #debatenight
@NadyaKhoja (vitriolic TV personality + highly identifiable politician for the last 2 decades) * media hype = reality politics #debates
These are people who are bad people. I am a New Yorker. From Harlem. Fuck Donald Trump. #Debates2016
Wow - @HillaryClinton is using Pilot G-2 pen,  the best gel pen ever. #ImWithHer   #debatenight #Debates
This is fucking ridiculous. How can people of good conscience support this guy? #debatenight
Here come the false charges from HRC connecting @wikileaks and Russia again #Debates2016
Yeah, because he was so nice to Ted Cruz, Kasich, Ben Carson, and Chris Christie... Bye Felecia  #debatenight
#Clinton needs to stop letting #Trump bring her down to his level, she can't win down there.  Hil, stick with the high road. #debatenight
OMG!! #Trump is calling on Sean Hannity for validation??? Let's grasp at some straws, shall we?? #debatenight #Hillary is ready to crack up!
We should all be asking ourselves hard questions about implicit bias. #Debates2016
"You want me to release my taxes? Well I want bugs to stop biting my dick but 'PAL IT AIN'T HAPPENIN'" ~ Trump #debates #debatenight
His face when she said, "Obama is a man of dignity."  What a fucking ass clown.   #DonTheCon   #debatenight
Did Donald Trump really just say he has a better temperament than Hillary Clinton...? Like, he was serious? #debatenight
Dollars to donuts that, at one point tonight, @HillaryClinton says "let them eat cake."  #debatenight
I don't know about Hillary supporters, but I'm really enjoying the #debates
We don’t need a president. We’ll run ourselves and we’ll promise to be good.  #DebateNight
both of these candidates are annoying. all they do is try to one-up or make each other look bad. glad I'm not eligible to vote. #debatenight
bruh, can @ArianaGrande run for president? sure she's underaged, but these two are giving me a headache. mostly trump. #debatenight.
@HillaryClinton sold our uranium to the Russians and she says nuclear weapons our greatest threat. #debatenight @realDonaldTrump
"He's 10, he has computers, he is SOOO good with these computers."  Sure he is, buddy.  #debatenight
WAIT DID TRUMP LITERALLY SAY HE WANTS TO TAKE PEOPLES GUNS AWAY WHAT THE FUCKS GOING ON #debatenight
@charliekirk11 That has to come up sooner or later. 2 more debates yet. Tonight almost over.
Donald Trump again refuses to take nuclear war off the table. #debatenight
RT: DrJillStein: It's telling that the #birther issue is a topic during the #debates. Don't the American people care more about jobs, healt…
TrUMP: SMARTER = unethical so if Christians = ETHICAL TRUMP = NonChristian #Debates
#trump complains about #NATO not paying their "fair share", you bragged about "being smart" to NOT pay your fair share! Shameful #debates
I want to give the @debates a shoutout for giving us this particularly shitty debate tonight. Way to @GovGaryJohnson out. #Debates
I don't think the choice has ever been harder to make.  I do not trust either.  #debatenight
Problem is, we need big change. Doing it the same isn't working. HRC won't do change #Debates
I was able to get him (Obama) to produce it (birth certificate) - Trump #debatenight
#CrookedHillary has not created any jobs all she has is one lie after another #debatenight
I'm recording this debate so I can use it tomorrow morning as a prescription for Zoloft #Debates2016
@debates so ur debate kinda.... really... sucks.  You're kinda wishing you #LetGaryDebate now dont you?? #debates #debatenight #Debates2016
@jadana17 r we listening to same debate? I didn't get that at all. Too funny. #debatenight
"If you are too dangerous to fly, you are too dangerous to buy a gun" @HillaryClinton #Debates2016
#debates are a lot more interesting... dare I say fun ... with twitter.
Thank u Mr. Trump letting my community know that our main concern going on in the 🌎 was Obamas birth and u solved it. 🙄 #sarcasm #debates
He just delivered a huge body shot bringing up "super predator" line from the 90's. It was racist AF. #debatenight @es_snipes
#Trump "It's all words...it's all sound bytes" and then proceeds to attempt to create some. #debatenight #debates #Debates2016
You know who needs to be moderate the #DebateNight @JudgeJudy Trump wouldn't be interrupting anyone!
So they skipped the racial part and are using black on black crime? #debatenight
Why do so many people believe that all ultra-rich people own businesses? because that's definitely not a 1-to-1 basis #Debates2016
So is he actually going to answer the question or not? #Debates2016
He did NOT just say that he has a "much better temperament than she has". OKAY DONALD. I CALL BULLSHIT. #DebateNight
Yes, trump stiffed our workers but Hillary let our troops to die #debatenight #Debates2016
I think HRC is preparing to be the Federal prison’s newest Inmate and Inmate of the year #debatenight #Debates2016
I missed the last 80 minutes of #Debates2016 because I was arguing on Facebook about the first 10 minutes
#debatenight you say nothing because you don't feel you need to apologize to a black man for doubting his origin
Yes Donald, we completely believe you when you say you will release your tax returns. #debatenight
Did Trump not prepare for the speach because of his confidence, or as a way to discount his vagueness and studders #debatenight
"I've got a better temperament than her." Does he know him at all? #debatenight #debate2016
It's utterly frightening to even think that this is what my future can potential be #lordbewithus #Debates2016
Even though this entire election has been a joke.. I'm still gonna vote because one is obviously more qualified than the other! #debatenight
#debatenight Hillary is right she owes nothing but her loyalty to her donors. She uses their money to pay her debt! @realDonaldTrump
#debatenight I just learned that Pres Bill Clinton told Hillary to point her finger when pushed into a corner during her prep work!!
Question:  Will we have commercials during the debate??  I'm hungry and have to potty. 😏 #debates2016
"@breecooley_: I think someone should check Trump's birth certificate because it sounds like he's 8. #debatenight". Really?  I'd say 4 or 5.
#Debates2016 #debates  Ask @MayorRGiuliani  about whether stop and frisk worked to reduce crime and save lives.
My god, he has amazing recall of details of any coverage of himself that he doesn't like. But nothing else. #debates
...do people actually care about the emails? I don't give a shit about my own emails #debatenight
Trump: disrespects Hillary and Obama nonstop Trump: how dare you disrespect Obama #debatenight
#debates2016 She is talking so far over his head. He looks like, "Oh wow, am I going to have to learn all this stuff?" 😂 #ImWithHer
@realDonaldTrump is telling White people that America is a third-world country and White people believe him. #debatenight
i can't wait for the gifs to come from this lmao #debatenight
@cinemasins I'd ask for a #debates sin video but I know your counter would prob have an emotional breakdown
#phil2505 #debatenight they're actually leaving because you're talking about implementing some scary shit
The Orange manatee would take a gold medal in mansplaining every time. #debatenight
"I opened a club with no discrimination against anybody." -President Trump #debatenight
Trump brings up"super-predator" and then under cuts it by pointing out that she apologized #debates
I have no words.  Did he just suggest that he helped @POTUS with his birther lie? #Debates2016 #forshame
@realDonaldTrump if Twitter fingers piss you off then your fingers need not to be near nuclear codes!!  #Debates2016
.@JustinTrudeau you guys have room for the best and brightest from Canada's underpants, right? #debates
Not sure why I bother writing fiction when lately reality is way more crazy. #debatenight
#debatenight Summed up like this; "I know what's going on. I have properties there"
New doormat @ Trump tower is @LesterHoltNBC .. letting Trump walk all over him. #Debates2016 #ImWithHer #debatenight #NeverTrump
Sean is my bestie. I bet no one else is better at being friends with Sean. Call him. He can use some friends. #debatenight

Opted against #debatenight cause I like my eyeballs and want to survive the night without gouging them out with a dull spoon.
#debates Painful to watch a man disintegrate, but he brought it on himself. @realDonaldTrump @HillaryClinton
Okay lets get down to the real question... Who is Penn State's next linebacker? #debates
Donald Trump could teach a course in "Mansplaining 101: How to Alienate Friends and Influence No One" #DebateNight #🗣🗣🗣
What Earth can I escape to in the Multiverse because this one too much #debatenight
Jab, jab uppercut... She is coming out of the corner swinging #Debates2016  #GotHim
He's very good at computers, eh? What if your son was behind the DNC hack? Has anyone looked into this? #debatenight
Trump advocates "stop and frisk" but ruled unconstitutional in New York, says Holt. Trump: "No, you're wrong." #debates
I can hear the people that live below me yelling at the tv. #debatenight
Trump obviously knows nothing of ISIS history. Or any history period #debatenight
Hillary is right. We need to take care of our Muslim citizens #debatenight
Trump just bragged about his income in talking about how bad the economy is. That is all #debatenight
YOU CANNOT RETROSPECTIVELY SAY IF OR IF NOT ISIS WOULD HAVE FORMED. YOU LITERALLY HAVE NO IDEA ABOUT THAT. #PresidentialDebate #debatenight
#debatenight   #Hillary too  much air time. Speaking her crap. #trump needs to take the offense not defense. This hack #liar #liar #liar
It's a scary world when @Lesdoggg can't find something funny to say about this debate. #WeAreDoomed #FutureEuropeanCitizen #Debates2016
Our next segment is called, "why did I think we could get through six 15 minute segments because I hate both of you." #debatenight #debates
Trump: China should go in to North Korea. And Mexico is going to pay for it. #fakequotes #debatenight #debates
So is this really a debate? A hotel owner vs. a real politician 😂 #debatenight
#debatenight so far #TrumpVsClinton #DonaldTrump doesn't know how to address #HillaryClinton going back &amp; forth Sec. Clinton or Hillary...
@HillaryClinton is race baiting. But again, she's a typical politician. All talk and no action #PresidentialDebate #debatenight
Holy hell. Remember Gore 2000? Hillary is going it to Trump. I honestly can't believe it. #debates
OMFG Moderator is coming at Trump's tax returns. Trump deflection is the Moby Dick of all red herring fallacies #debatenight
"The security aspect of cyber is really really tough." What. Wtf is cyber? You mean cyber-security right? Donald? #debatenight
It'd be nice if he could shut up and let her speak  #debatenight
saying Muslims "need to cooperate" with law enforcement. i really don't like that. #debatenight
Donald Trump has to stop saying "these politicians who lie" right now, this is what you are, Smh, You haven't done anything yet #Debates2016
I thought Hillary's father made fabrics and now he's hanging them? Wow he moved quickly up the ladder in 10 minutes #debates
omg...he is an actual child. "nuh-uh, I didn't say that" dude, we know you said that! #debatenight
Trump says that him being in favour of the Iraq war is rumour, circulated by mainstream media and put out by "her", aka Clinton #DebateNight
I loved Hillary's demeanour today. #debatenight She looks so natural and in control.
"I have a much better temperament than she does." -Trump   Hillary thought bubble " No, you mean you have distemper..." #debatenight
"I opened a club in Palm Beach so I know all about the struggles of the lower class." - Trump #Debates2016
It feels like someone is playing long game chess and someone is...speaking English. #Debates2016
TRUMP YOU JUST GOT CALLED OUT FOR BEING RACIST AND CANT EVEN PROPERLY DENY IT! GO HOME #debatenight
Is it a reason why this dude thinks cause he has property in a community, he knows what it is to LIVE BLACK? C'mon son! Gtfoh! #debatenight
HRC droppin' the lingo.  Fact checkers are turnt!  Ain't no party like a  #debatenight party.
I believe DJT just said the economy is more important than the war on terror. #debatenight
Where are the hactivists ?? Trump wants to own the Internet ?? #debates #Debates2016 #HillaryVsTrump
Donald talks about 5 officers being shot but doesn't talk about police taking the lives of innocent people #debates
He just said he will release his tax returns and just moved on. He made audit seem like a big deal  #Debates2016
Almost every time Trump speaks he talks about his damn endorsements  #Debates
I am more entertained by putting snapchat filters on Trump &amp; Clintons faces than I am actually watching the debate  #debatenight
The question is does Lester Holt not have control of when his mic is on? Is that why he's all but absent here? #debates
@HillaryClinton called @realDonaldTrump a racist. Shes smelled weakness and went in for the kill #debatenight @andersoncooper @CNNPolitics
Does Trump not realize that there's a microphone right in front of his face? 🙄 #debatenight
Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump strategies for dealing with crime in the black community have overlap.   Let. That. Sink. In.  #DebateNight
I stop paying attention for two seconds and Donald Trump mentions the birther movement and ISIS in one feel swoop #debates
#debates2016 Trump is just as much of a character in the debates as he is on his on his TV. Rude, interrupts and doesn't follow the rules.
Hillary is quite irritating how she has been laughing and smiling throughout the whole debate. I can't take it.  #Debates2016
Oh birther shit is an EXCELLENT thing to bring up in a segment on racism. #debatenight
LaGuardia is actually horrible but I promise that's not Hillary's fault. #debatenight
The fed is doing political guys! Seriously. Big ugly bubble. Big. Ugly. Bigly. Bubbly. Lester. #debatenight
I hate both of them I feel like this whole #election is a big ass joke #Debates #CNN
The only mess we are in is allowing this ass clown to get the nomination. #debatenight
Of course she argued with him? She was opposing him in a debate? #debates
I try not to express my political views but listening to Donald Trump is actually giving me pain and we're only 30 minutes in #debates
I'm pretty confident that Hillary Clinton has never served in the armed forces. So no she's not or never has fought ISIS #debatenight
This debate is not nearly as entertaining as I expected it to be.  It does illustrate the candidates’ characters well, though.  #Debates
First Howard Stern reference in a presidential debate. #debate #debatenight #history @HowardStern when do they measure dicks?
Please let this man @GovGaryJohnson in the debates. He will outperform both of these "candidates"
#debatenight @realDonaldTrump cannot stop interrupting.  Almost unwatchable.  Lester, get him under control.
No one taught Trump how agreements work --just because you say something to someone doesn't mean they agree with you. #debatenight
We have wrongly accused prisoners, we have people murdered by cops. We have people doing crazy jail times for weed. Let's talk #debatenight
If he talks over her one more time I'm going to break my own TV. My nose to spite my face, Trump-style #debatenight
Trump would like to use his life line to call Sean Hannity #debatenight
We need "Law &amp; Order: Trump SVU" Dick Wolf take note. #debatenight
I'm not sure if I want to put ice in my drink anymore 😳🙍🏽 #debatenight
Can @LesterHoltNBC tell him to be quiet and make him actually answer the questions?? #Debates2016 #debatenight #2016debates
How Trump is connected to places: he either owns property there, or has invested.  #debatenight
Trump developed relations with blacks over the last little while. So this week...#Debates2016
ffs thE FACES TRUMP IS PULLING omL Also "Not like you think in your.. 'president things'.." lol wtf?? pres.pls???  #debates
My God, Hillary is one of worst candidates in history &amp; Republicans nominated the one person who could lose to her. Pathetic #DebateNight
Trump is like a child who keeps yelling &amp; pulling on your shirt for attention, but has nothing important to say. #debatenight
They keep shouting at each other ... Stop ... Focus on the topic  #debatenight
#debatenight Did Trump ever take a US Government class in school ? He has no clue on how our government works
That didn't take long for him to get a free ad in for new hotel. (Where towels, sheets etc are NOT made in USA) #Debates2016
He keeps interrupting her &amp; thinks this'll play well with whatever swing voters he wants to capture in the electorate? #Debate #debatenight
For the record, the only hacker I've ever met was about 130lbs, soaking wet. Also, he's Russian. #debates #Debates2016
The mayor didn't end it, the damn court system did, you fucking dunce. #debatenight
"Why won't you release your taxes". @realDonaldTrump "Mexico. China. I'm rich. Hillary's emails".  #debates
"Implicit bias." A nonsense phrase that sounds important. Sums up the ridiculousness of this debate. #debatenight #debates #Debates2016
"I was just endorsed by ISssss..." How many people just GULPED so hard rn #debatenight
Ummm... no Trump, six hundred and fifty million is A LOT of money. #debatenight
#debatenight livestream @factcheckers  were is all the money lost from 911 pentagon,and the war at the time,who has gone to jail ??insidejob
Hillary should have known this topic was coming. Her first response could have been better. #DebateNight
This debate reminds me of when I'm teaching. I'm Hillary trying to talk, Trump is the kids talking over me. #PresidentialDebate #Debates2016
I can't understand why ppl would vote for that hair piece #debatenight #debates  He won't even let her talk smh
According to @realDonaldTrump everything in #America is like a 3rd World Country...I don't think he knows what that means #debatenight
Today #HillaryClinton says #Iraq was "weeks away from having a bomb", but said before #WMDs did not exist? Which is it. #debatenight
Can we get rid of Lester Holt and get jon stewart to moderate #debatenight
They have to name the topic on the screen because lawd knows what Trump is talking about. #debatenight
I feel bad for the guy Lester trying to control this debate and Trump and Clinton won't let him 😂😂 #debatenight
The audience laughing right now at "I have a much better temperament than her" #debates
@aplusk please tell me you're just punking America. You can come out now.  ....pls   #debatenight
Trump is splitting them by continuing to play the US vs THEM ("politicians") card... #debatenight #debates
I hope that our parish prayers @OLGCPlymouth - our fasting and prayers for mercy - bring some sense to the debates. #debatenight God help us
.@realDonaldTrump I built an unbelievable company. But, on occasion, we used certain laws that are there.  #debatenight
.#debatenight Race Relations: @HillaryClinton "Everyone should be respected by the law and respect the law."
.#debatenight Race Relations: @HillaryClinton "If you're too dangerous to fly, you're too dangerous to buy a gun."
are you kidding me? he's talking about police officers being shot, but not about black people getting shot by police officers? #debatenight
Neither one of them is really offering up real solutions. Trump slandering Hill + Hill is trying to display all her receipts #debatenight
She made the mistake of offering rationality and fairness when talking about cops. This of ALL of them is an emotional issue #debates
3000 shootings, 4000 dead. Ya math off Chump, I mean Trump #debatenight
Trump says, screaming into his microphone and gripping his podium, "I HAVE A MUCH BETTER TEMPERAMENT THAN SHE!" #debates
@_Cook4620_ @DrJillStein @GovGaryJohnson Gary didn't make the debates so he's considered irrelevant. And Jill is just Jill, poor girl
Take way guns from bad people not the law abiding ones.  #Debates
Not paying taxes doesn't make you smart, it's dereliction of duty.  #R3POTUSDebate #Debates2016
@HillaryClinton  Stay focused. Don't make people feel sorry for him. Let him beat himself!  #Debates2016
#Debates She doesn't sweat.  Is that a wig, is she sick, and a Manchurian Candidate.
He is burying himself right now!  He has a terrible temper!   #debatenight
Could give a SHIT what his tax returns are...I care more about MY tax returns...and the lack of a refund in the last four yrs #debatenight
I want to be smart too &amp; not pay taxes. Why is it OK for @realDonaldTrump &amp; not for the rest of us? #debatenight
how is not paying taxes smart? no it makes you a criminal 🙄 #debatenight
"It's all words, it's all soundbites." - Trump just laid out his entire political strategy in six words. #debates
"As soon as I figure out a way to fake my income on my tax returns, I'll release them." - Trump #Debates2016 #debatenight
we MUST bring back law and order to chicago! everyone is being killed there! stop and frisk! #debates
Isn't it cool how you don't even notice the candidates tweeting while they're on stage? They'd do well in college. #debatenight #celect16
Events like the debates are the fun little reminders of the narrow minded loud people from high school I forgot existed &amp; wish I still did.
A dog could be moderating this debate and there would be no change #Debates2016
I don't think either candidate is ideal but Clinton will be a damn sight better than Trump #Debates2016
Did you guys see that part in SCANNERS when the dude's head blew up?  #debatenight
.@realDonaldTrump you don't need to lean into your mic like that. especially seeing as the live one is on your lapel. #debatenight #wrong
"I prepared to be president" that shouldn't be an insult and yet.... #debatenight
Notice Secretary Clinton calmly waits her turn to speak like an adult. #Debates
I'm expecting the Stone Cold theme to start any minute and the Texas Rattlesnake to come out and start stunner'ing people #debatenight
Guns out of the hands of people who shouldn't have them is in conflict with working with the police #debatenight
Who put these young black #superpredators in prisons Hillary?? Your husband Bill Clinton policies. #debatenight  #Debates2016  #debates
"I just want to get the answer here..." oh Lester, don't we all. #debatenight #Debates2016
Sorry Trump, but America is not just another one of your companies and you can't expect to run it like one. #debatenight
Guess I shouldn't be surprised that Donald Trump is into fat shaming in this #debatenight.
Can you imagine this dude negotiating the finer points of, well, anything of importance? 🤔 #debatenight
Dude no one cares about your achievements or endorsements.. what about the people. #debatenight
"Hillary Clinton does not want to use a couple of words: Game of Thrones/ Breaking Bad/Bob's Burguers" #debatenight
I hope Barack made a drinking game out of this, too. #debates
Hillary is so cool and calm and Trump is losing his almighty shit. #ImWithHer  #debatenight
@HilaryClinton is No.1 Presidential material...c'mon America, vote for this well experienced Stateswoman!  #Debates
Man, this dude is SO UNSTABLE!!! #DebateNight     whoever gave Trump a Red Bull before this debate needs to be fired... #debate2016
Humble brag!  take a shot... actually, you're probably already dead from alcohol poisoning  #Debates2016
@timandsid I watched until it was 3-1 then tuned into the debates.. WTF HAPPENED
#DonaldTrump says he has the best temperment.  His doctor says It's always at 98.6 degrees.  #debatenight
Trump Detroit DOES NOT LIKE YOU!Talk about the negative responses you got , you don't care about us. #debatenight
Trump is right. Only 5 NATO countries pay their fair share. #debatenight #PresidentialDebate
"I think Donald just criticized me for preparing for this debate... I also prepared to be president." DANG. #debatenight
No Donald, we think you're disgraceful. I'm convinced the world is coming to an end. Jesus is on his way back y'all get ready #Debates
Fuck rebuilding the middle class what about the homeless and the poor ?? #debatenight
"We have a Fed that's doing political things." That's a helluva charge coming from a presidential candidate. #debates
But seriously, have you ever flown to/through MCI - Kansas City? #3rdWorldAirport   #debatenight #Debates2016
Take the oil! Out of the ground with a huge straw and take it to America!  #debatenight
Hey @realDonaldTrump... wanna give me some of that $694 million from this past year? kthxbye. #debatenight
TRUMP SAID HE WILL RELEASE TAX RETURNS WHEN HILLARY RELEASES THE DELETED EMAILS #debatenight #debates
Notice he's not saying he's innocent. Just that he never admitted guilt in court.  #debatenight
Glad Lester brought them back on track - they both hopped off the race topic as fast as they could  #DebateNight
Trump is SICK if he thinks he did the nation a service by stoking the birther movement #DebateNight #Debates2016 #PresidentialDebate
If Tr*mp could stop creepily addressing all his comments to Lester that would be good #debates
"A city that I love, a city where I have investments" HUH #Debates
When one candidate is speaking they should turn off the mic of the other candidate. That would prevent the rude interruptions. #debatenight
no matter who wins come 2020 the president elected this year will lose by a landslide 🤒 #debatenight
Which African-American community?! The one with the Stacey Dashes, the David Clarkes, and the Uncle Ruckuses? #DebateNight
Bragging that you are smart for not paying taxes does not make you fit for public service. #Debates2016
Oh shit Trump activated Hillary's trap card. Stiffed Talk: remove all business cards from your hand. #debates
#debatenight #Debates2016  Top down doesn't work.  Delete one vomit from Hillary for common sense.  Hillary 😯😯  Trump 😯😯😯😯😯😯😯😯😯
Are presidential candidates subject to drug screening and if so, let's release those results too. #debatenight
how many debates you think we have left til trump just straight up drops the n-word and sets a Quran on fire
great job hillary, throw in a quote from michelle obama. that'll win 'em over. #debatenight
I couldn't get through debates without @metafilter. My internet home for 10+ years.
I think it's funny how literally everyone is watching the debates and playing drinking games like take a shot when Trump says something dumb
Lets play a game:  Take a shot every time Trump doesn't answer a question. Oh wait, you'd be dead already.    #Debates
It amazes me that Hillary could win this debate without saying a single word. #debatenight
why are they stuck on the same arguments everytime they speak to each other?? I'm actually watching 5 year olds. #debatenight
i work with people who have communication disorders &amp; still can't figure out what trump is saying  #Debates
Trump is trying to roast Clinton and she's literally just laughing at him omf g #debates #debatenight
What is a "governmental society?" #drump's vocabulary continues to abuse the English language and everyone else's intelligence #debatenight
The housing discrimination suit was settled WITH an admission of guilt. LIAR!  #debatenight
"We've got to address the systemic racism in our criminal justice system"-@HillaryClinton  YES YES YES #debates
Walked out of the room to get a drink. Three minutes tops &amp; already have over 150 tweets on my feed. That's how you know it's #debatenight
Trump was also right about mainstream media being Clinton's best campaign ally. #debatenight #Debates2016 #DNCleak #BringBernieBack
I can't believe one of our major presidential nominees just bragged about not paying taxes #debatenight #debates
"And maybe because you haven't paid any federal income tax in many years. " I'm sorry someone get some ice for trump. #debatenight
Donald was firing people on the Apprentice.  Don't pin Libya on the reality star. #debatenight
So Mr. Trump, who are the bad people? How can you tell? Are color and race a part of your judgement of that? #DebateNight
#Clinton discusses #Trump not revealing his #tax details &amp; outlines the potential reasons...#Hillary coming on strong #debates #debatenight
A lot of American debt is owned by American citizens. China isn't an argument. #DebateNight
Chris Christie laying on his bed working on his laptop just cried hard. #debatenight
What is there... six or seven Law &amp; Order shows? I think we have enough Law &amp; Order. #debatenight
One filthy rich candidate pretending she's not rich and one filthy rich candidate bragging about his wealth. #debatenight
LOL no Lester you're wrong. Racial profiling works! Please Trump continue to tell me about African-American communities. #debatenight
#debatenight I was sorry to se Trump chose not to wear a "Make America Great Again" hat at the debate. @AdvanceGuyNotes  @DennisWAlpert
I think my tongue is breaking out in hives from anxiety. #TMI? #debatenight
I have a tremendous income. You're going to love my income. Everyone says I have the best income. #debatenight
"The record shows that I'm right"  THIS MAN IS INNNNNSAAAAAAAAAAAANE #debatenight #Debates
"I take advantage of the laws of the nation..to take care of myself." There's your presidential candidate @realDonaldTrump. #Debates2016
Trump saying he used certain laws of the nations and took advantage of them. #debatenight #ksatdebate
Clinton response, "listen to what you just heard" he started his political activity on racist lie. #ksatdebate #debatenight
Trump says he will take out ISIS. Trump saying some troops should've stayed behind, and taken the oil. #debatenight #ksatdebate
Yeah go to @realDonaldTrump's site. It doesn't work, just like his platform #debates
Trump: I'll bring back Jerry Orbach, so we can bring back Law &amp; Order. #debatenight
When they go low we go high. Taking the high road with you, @HFA #debatenight
Donald, an IRS audit does not preclude you from releasing your taxes. #debatenight
'I'm a business person!' So get off the fucking presidential debate stage. #debatenight
Hillary u are guilty for everything sick that has happened !!!!!!!!!!!!! #Debates
"I can give you a list of banks."  Thank you, @realDonaldTrump #Debates2016
Hillary just hit y'all with the Black people kill Black people too! #debatenight
Now that we found the "birth certificate" Trump can NOW get on with Isis... #debatenight
I think Trump has criticized me for preparing for this debate. Yes I did. You know what else I prepared for? Being president. #debatenight
This Hillary deadpan glare at the camera right now is everything #debatenight
I'm really disappointed in our choices this year for president. Literally a monkey would do better than these two clowns. #debatenight
Trump Logic: I didn't pay my taxes therefore I'm smart and fit to run this country... #debatenight
He will avoid talking about race at all and just talk about crime #debatenight
"I didn't start it. She did." points at @HillaryClinton. What r u @realDonaldTrump? Five? Winning temperament? U mean WHINING? #DebateNight
How can anyone truly think trump crushed this debate please explain? #debatenight
No tax returns &amp; The Donald admits he doesn't pay taxes and stiffs people. Great businessman. Lester silent. #debatenight
Moderator should ask Donald if the 14th Amendment applies to the 2nd Amendment. #debunkdonald #debatenight
We have a fed that's doing "political things." Wait a sec. I thought he had a very big brain &amp; the best words. LOL #debatenight
Oh my god he did not just say global warming isnt a thing, what an idiot #debatenight
Speaking of your fathers middle class job still doesn't make you relatable. Accidentally deleted 33k emails???  Seriously?!?!#debates
This is embarrassing. And it still won't matter to the idiots who support him. #Debates2016
Hillary makes mistakes all the time.  Imagine how many mistakes she'll make as POTUS  #DisgracefulHillary  #debatenight   Vote #Green2016
You cannot take a sovereign nations resources. That's against the Geneva Convention. #debatenight
#Trump: I’m cool with all types of rich ppl, man, just chill out! #aslongasyougotmoney #debates
If the people of NRA are really "good" people how come there aren't any real gun laws ?? #debatenight #debates
"I have much better judgement than she does". Wow Donald wow. #debatenight
In general, listening to white people talk about race is so painful. #DebateNight
@realDonaldTrump: "I will release my tax audits when she (@HillaryClinton) releases her 33,000 emails." #debates
Has anyone caught ANY details from Drumpf? He's bullshitting this entire debate...and he's not even good at it. #debates
Just learned that the computer aspect of cyber is very tough. #drink #oyvey #debatenight
Debating about whether or not it was even worth turning the TV on for this. #Debates2016
Trump is so humble. The humblest really. Ask anyone. Especially Trump. #debatenight
@CNN #DEBATES2016 Yeah, you get audited because you do all the wrong things to make money.
I'm sorry Trump, but he is also your President. Show some damn respect #debates #fucktrump
Why is @LesterHoltNBC asking 2 priviledged white people about the oppression of and racist attitude towards black people?  #debatenight
HEY HEADASS STOP AND FRISK ISNT A SOLUTION TO COPS KILLING BLACK PEOPLE #debatenight
I completely zoned out at "we have to do better at cyber" #Debates2016
Trump needs to drink more water  Dude is getting really red faced #Debates2016
Trump is scrambling. Hillary is cool as a cucumber in an icebox #Debates2016
No one was caring yet you continued birtherism.. you still at your rallies and interviews say Obama is secretly a terrorist. #debates
Stop advocating for racist policing methods! Then talking bout needing better relationships smh #debatenight
"Vacuum up intelligence" - I could never be in a debate because I'd respond to this with a Dyson joke. #debatenight
"That's another beauty" says Trump like he is talking about a Buick instead of diplomatic relations #debatenight
While Donald blithers, Hillary is mentally humming "Doo Wah Diddy Diddy." #debates
How about we don't have a president for the next 4 years....#debatenight
We do need to get guns out of those that shouldn't have them, take the guns from police #debatenight #blacklivesmatter
I don't know, but is it appropriate-- ironic--foreshadowing-- that I am in Canada during the debates?
Genuinely surprised Trump didn't say "The bubble is so big, fat, and ugly, I call it Rosie O'Donnell." #debatenight
I knew this dishonest asshole was going to seen the audience. #ImWithHer #debatenight
Wow Hillary is sticking it to Trump on the #birther issue!!! #debates #debatenight Only an idiot can follow him, ever;;
"...knock the hell out of".    -Trump Do you possibly mean, "annihilate" Or "eliminate" or "excise" or other acceptable word? #Debates2016
#Trump: We’ve become a third world country! … &amp; it’s politicians like #HillaryClinton that made it that way! #Debatenight #Debates2016
#Trump knows African Americans &amp; Hispanics live outside of inner cities, too right? This false equivalency he keeps making is crap. #Debates
#HillaryClinton: Let’s talk about the question you actually asked, Lester.  Me: cheers so hard I fall off the couch. #Debatenight
Does anyone else feel that Donald Trump sounds like Dr. Seuss talking about his financials and businesses. #debates2016
#lyinghillary is going to look really bad tomorrow after the beating shes taking tonight #debates
Trump is the kid in school that explains/tells a story just so he can brag about himself. #debates
what the fuck is she talking about...The Bushes are supporting her NOW! #debatenight #tytlive
Hillary threatens Russia &amp; other countries for hacking - maybe she should protect her own classified emails #Debates2016 #BringBernieBack
After seeing that lectern of @HillaryClinton's before the debate I'll have to call her "Stubby" for "short" from now on. #Debates2016
Why did Lester bring up the birther question? Makes no difference. #debates #debatenight
In short "I opened a club and many people like me and think I'm the original Jesus" DT #kappræður #debatenight #Debates2016
Hillary's comment on the atrocity of private prisons gave me cummies #debatenight
Being under audit for 15 years is not a good thing. #debatenight
If you don't learn that much from tax reforms, why not release them? #debatenight
Just say the catch phrase so we can fill in our bingo cards, Hillary. #debatenight
HE'S A DOUCHE AND SO IS EVERYONE IVE DEFRIENDED SO FAR OVER THOS ELECTIOM #debatenight
Race remains to be a significant challenge in this country? That's because the liberals make it that way. #debates
@CNN Finally #Hillaryous is #Punching , there are two ends to a bargain.. #Trumped doesn't believe that. #Debates2016   #debatenight
IF I HEAR STOP AND FRISK ONE MORE TIME I'LL KNOCK TRUMP OUT WITH MY POCKET CONSTITUTION #debatenight
#debatenight: Trump is getting more &amp; more incoherent as the night goes on.
#debatenight : I'm sure China will do Trump's bidding on North Korea when he imposes tariffs on them.
Sniffy lies again on Iraq and Libya caught you out Donald out AGAIN @Brits4Hillary @HillaryClinton @AdamParkhomenko #Debates2016 #ImWithHer
Trump loves Law &amp; Order. Someone get him the box set for Christmas #Debates
I've seen plenty of these things in WWE. Any moment now they'll flip the tables. #debates
#debatenight , money, money, money... 40' and only money , the kind and amount of money that none of you ever see! Wake up!
Has he ever been to a 3rd world country? Jesus Christ, we don't need airports, we need to fix that we have 3rd world countries #Debates
"Yes I was sued for being racist, but that's okay because tons of other companies were sued for it too!" SMH. #debatenight
The way trump slowly leaned into the mic and slowly and quietly said "wrong" was so fucking funny #debatenight
The read Hilary is delivering I am complete here for it #debatenight
Did this man seriously use the word "bragadacious"? WHOS MANS... @MELANIATRUMP COME COLLECT UR MANS OFF THE STAGE FAM. #Debates #debatenight
Fuck me. I was doing fine in the drinking game. I didn't honestly think "temperament" would hit so hard.  #debatenight
If you're black and still thinking the political system is going to help you, whether it be Trump or Hillary, you're slow. #debatenight
Am I really really tired (yes) or are @realDonaldTrump and @HillaryClinton starting to look similar? #debatenight
Donald Trump has yet to answer one of the questions. And that's a real thing #debates
Yes police are implicitly bias. Be honest. Let me hear what trump saying on that note. #debatenight
Even Mexicans with calves like cantaloupes couldn't haul the bs Trump is slinging, right @SteveKingIA?  #debatenight
Trump is bragging about his brand, not answering questions, and is bullying #DebateNight
But what would Trump do to make the loss of the people be less? Because I think Trump would not make any better knowing him!  #Debates2016
Sitting in India &amp; watching #debatenight, how can a party have a candidate like Trump? Zero ans.for the questions asked so far.
Aaaaaand he melted &amp; went off the rails. Ladies &amp; gentlemen the nominee you've been defending with your life is a fraud  #debatenight
You: "I think we should see other people"  Me: "you've been fighting Isis your entire adult life"  #debatenight
Wait, did Donald JUST SAY HE STIFFED THE GUY? Because maybe he didn't like the work and America should do it too??? #debatenight
Did anyone catch HRC's subtle eye roll when Trump just started his latest ramble?  #debatenight It's gotta be tough to debate this wacko
Law and order because they're out of control! Why are they in this predicament Donald? @#debatenight
Here's a suggestion: how about y'all leave the Middle East alone? #Debates2016
Tonight is one of those times I'm glad I also follow non-politics on Twitter; more to life than just politics #Debates2016
Of course you'd be endorsed by #ICE. Your immigration plan would give them billions in more federal funding @realDonaldTrump #Debates2016
At least hillary admits that there is racial injustice in the system  #Debates
"I say nothing "but let me just tell you" - trump 💀 #Debates
Doesn't Hillary look like a patient headmistress with problem child whining petulantly ? #HillaryVsTrump #Debates2016
Is there a phone a friend during debates?thought that was for that other tv show...eff it we are just having a pop culture grab bag in 2016.
...I...really don't see how #Drumpf's performance tonight really helps him with ppl who don't already drink his bathwater. #debatenight
When you build a golf coarse everywhere you drop a deuce, maybe don't mock another guy for liking golf. #Debates2016
"It's not in a braggadocious way..." We'll all be the judge of that Brannigan. #Debates2016
@realDonaldTrump realizes that the creation of Isis happened before @BarackObama came into office right!? #debatenight #Debates2016
So @gigabarb He only has an hours worth of self constraint. Time for the fireworks now! #debatenight
I wanna see ISIS's birth certificate before I release my tax returns.  #debatenight  #dumptrump
Well that's an plan, Donald, 5.3 trillion dollars to "spend on inner-cities and other things." #debatenight
Even after you got the birth certificate you claimed he wasn't a us citizen. Lol watch him squirm!!! #DebateNight
If Trump says "I'm very proud of it." one more time my head will explode. #debates
was honestly waiting for Trump to say his 10yr old fixes his computer for him #debatenight
Am I just mad or is there a non-zero possibility that #trump would invade #Iran and start world war 3? Should I be worried? #debates #ohgod
Instead of calling Hannity, use your call to make sure Lester is OK #debatenight
Hilary just wants another pay day she won't even wear a USA flag pin  #Debates2016
What is cyber and how do I get tough on it? I thought that was an a/s/l thing. #debatenight
Situations like Chicago don't happen unless people are desperate. It's not law and order they need. It's economic opportunity. #Debates2016
This is literally just the two of them throwing shade and that's what I'm here for #Debates2016
This is staying on taxes. Can we go back to the emails?  I do want 2 know how it was a mistake but her ppl need 2 take the 5th #debatenight
Trump: EVERYTHING IS BAD. Clinton: Right. And this is how I'd fix it-- Trump: SHE HAS NO PLAN. #debatenight
LOL TRUMP HAS A BETTER TEMPERAMENT THAN HILLARY AND I AM A WIZARD WHO CAN SHIT GOLD. ON COMMAND. #debates
'I voted for every sanction against Iran' Clintons handy work is as encouraging as Trumps bigotry. #debatenight
If he doesn't attack on her playing a part in Russia having those secrets it will be a failure.  #debates
When Donald isnt interrupting her she actually says some very important shit. Like I like almost everything she said #debatenight
Police are afraid to do anything?!?! How many people have been shot?????? #debatenight
Nobody cares about his taxes. Everybody cares about her emails.  #debates #debatenight
New #debatenight drinking game! Drink responsibly, at your own pace. If you want.
So what was that you said about accepting race, Donald?  #gohillary      #debates #debatenight
Lester: You're plan is racist  Trump: No it's not I'M racist...   #debatenight  #FatTrump  #BlackLivesMatter
Contrary to what Trump claims,  global warming is real and is a global problem #debatenight
So he's admitting that he used certain laws to avoid paying people what he owes them? #debatenight
Both are trying so hard to ignore the racism problem that ppl face daily! Answer the damn ?s .What are you doing about oppression?? #Debates
Law and order isn't really going to bridge the racial divide. #debatenight #2016debates
Lester: WE NEED TO MOVE ON   also lester: *stays silent again*   #debatenight
LOL Lester's like, BTW, this segment's about RACE. Check your privilege. #debatenight
The awkward  moment when you tried to help the Middle East but ended up destroying it. #debatenight
Tonight's debate is a proof that Clinton and Trump are equally as bad #debates2016 #presidentialdebate #politics.
#CrookedHillary says she has a plan to fight ISIS.  Does her plan include allowing un-vetted #SyrianRefugees into our Country? #Debates2016
Do you really trust #CrookedHillary after her Disastrous #IranDeal?  Iran was choking under the U.S. Sanctions.  Not anymore. #Debates2016
#CrookedHillary wants to move past the ISIS portion of the Debate because she knows she cannot defend her record. #Debates2016
I trust #Trump to handle our Nuclear Codes over #SickHillary who may accidentally push button after she collapses from a stroke. #debates
Trump denounces that Russia responsible for #DNChack despite FBI saying it was. #debatenight
We need to improve sentencing practices, give judges more leeway, and yes, stop privatizing state/nat'l prisons. #Debates2016
When I flew out of Laguardia several years ago, I ordered a hamburger on an iPad. #ThirdWorldAirports #Debates
Come on with the follow up Lester... Well the audits say something about you and your dealings... #debatenight #debates
I wonder is @MerriamWebster will be considering adding Trump's new words "bigly" &amp; "bragadocious" #debates
All I need is for Lester or Hilary to say "nigga, please" #debates
So we should have been upfront about invading the Middle East for oil? #Debates
I think Hillary expected that zinger to hit harder. Been there.... #debatenight
Trump literally only cares about cities where he has investments. Everywhere else is "many others." Do you live in #manyothers? #DebateNight
Trump's so sick he's having to hold himself up with the podium.  #snottyTrump #debatenight
If it doesn't work that way, Trump....then stop trying to get in good with the African American community...We don't want you. #Debates2016
Wait why are we doing personal attacks? Can we talk about the issues, please? #debates #Debates2016
Trump is almost like an enigma, no matter how hard you try, you cannot understand what the fuck is being said #Debates
Omg. He's actually promoting his hotel. This was all an ad. #debatenight
But we are so off the point tonight this is rediculous. #debatenight
If I wanted to watch an elegant woman quietly watch a man light himself on fire I would’ve watched Vietnam documentaries in Rome #debates
Politifact already said Trump was lying about financial disclosure forms being more important than tax returns. Trump is lying. #debates
Let's not pretend like there is a way to construe Donald Trump winning during these #debates. This was a Hillary For America ad #SheWon
haven't seen a performance this good since lebron led the cavs back from a 3-1 deficit in the nba finals #debatenight
Where's ANONYMOUS at?! Trump just called y'all (a) fat loser(s)....????   #debatenight
"We lose on everything." Well even a clock is right twice a day. We DAMN SHO losing. #debates
they want support, more training &amp; assistance = they want more money from the federal government. #debates #debatenight #betweenthelines
(Not paying federal taxes) "That makes me smart" @realDonaldTrump  it really doesn't #debatenight
Yo Trump, You don't get to agree when Hilary says "even one murder is too many" when YOU ACTIVELY SUGGEST WAR CRIMES. Fuck you #debatenight
Donald nobody gives a shit about where your businesses are located #debatenight
His penis must be so fucking small that he needs to mention is (likely inflated) earnings. #debates #debatenight #Debates2016
THIS LAW THAT ALLOWS COMPANIES TO SETTLE WITHOUT ADMISSION OF GUILT NEEDS TO GO THE FUCK AWAY!!!!! WHY SETTLE IF YOU'RE RIGHT?! #debates
"He paid ZERO income taxes". "That makes me smart."  🙈 #PresidentialDebate #Debates2016
.@HillaryClinton: "Maybe he's not as rich as he says he is, maybe he's not as charitable as he claims to be." #debatenight #Debates2016
I have common sense.  - DONALD Trump   😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁 #Debates
She's gonna have a police commission?!?!  The federation wants to become an empire #debates
Howard Stern mentioned on the  #Debates This is history in the making!  #BaBaBooey #HitEmWithTheHein  @HowardStern
Still waiting for someone to tell me that Trump has been one heck of a hidden camera prank #debatenight
@dissonance_pod when does the "bad things, the very bad things" come out? #Debates2016
Trump: all my friends are in the audience Yeah all five of them except putin #debatenight
Trump believes everyone should pay their fair share but also believes cheating the govt out of his taxes makes him smart. #debatenight
Someone call up Sean Hannity   Please  Please   Do it   I dare you  #Debates2016
Apparently @realDonaldTrump asked the @nytimes to endorse him and they said "nah"...he's shit talking them now #Debates2016
#debatenight If Trump has built such a great business, why does he stiff contractors?  "That's business"?  Shameful.
If we were all smart and paid no federal taxes where would we be? #debates
#debatenight Nuke subs, STUPID !!! Apparently he only watches "the shows" B52s ?
Lester is gonna lose it before the end of the night #debatenight
Trump could make a useful financial consultant to the White House. That doesn't make him a good presidential candidate. #debatenight
Since he's not talking about #birtherism it anymore, I guess he's not going to respond. #Debates2016
I actually feel bad he has to do this two more times. #Debates2016
#debates Trump is so funny to look, he should be there every year doing the same show. I just hope he does not win, that will be a sad show
"We were all racists, so it was ok.  Also, more stop and frisk" @realDonaldTrump #debatenight #ImWithHer #racismisreal
#debatenight  Hillary just threatened to go to war with Russia over the #DNCLeak but it's Trump who doesn't have the temperament for POTUS?
@realDonaldTrump , you can release your tax return while under audit. I don't give a damn about your profit margin. #debatenight
Trump always says we will take out Isis. What he never says is how. Because he has no plan unless he's gonna drop a nuke.  #debatenight
Can we ask the candidates to locate different places on a map I think that would be a fun game for #debatenight
Good. #TrumpPence16 brought it back to how his financials are so good instead of answering the bomb about tax returns. #Debates2016
I can see the headlines now "the ratings were great but the country's screwed!" #debates #debatenight
I forgot to put the garbage out, all good just blame HC  #Debates
Jesus, Trump... Do you have to shout "WRONG!" every single fucking time someone says something you disagree with?  Wait your turn!  #debates
Please share those ideas! So far it's been vague things he's heard or been told by unknown "friends" #Debates2016
I'm rich as fuck my friends say I'm great vote for me #debatenight
"I'll release my tax returns immediately, if Hillary releases her deleted emails" - @realDonaldTrump #shotsfired #debatenight
"That makes me smart" - Trump live on the U.S. Presidential Debate in response to not paying his taxes #Debates
Looks at this pumpkin fuck scoff at “people of color are disproportionately targeted by law enforcement and incarceration” #DebateNight
And there it is, first mention of the emails. That's all, folks #debatenight
Can someone close caption Trump's response to race relations in Spanish please? #debatenight #Debates2016 #HushMoney
.@POTUS should do a Roosevelt and go for a 3rd stint and hope 2020 brings semi-decent candidates #debates
I wish I could proudly say my brand site out loud like Hillary did tonight. #Debates2016
"4000 people have been shot in Chicago since January 1st" Donald Trump(fact check) only 3224 actually shot since then.) #debatenight
Gee, he went there with the stop and frisk, which failed BIG TIME #Debates
How do you take the oil @realDonaldTrump ?  Wait leave the troops? That was W #debatenight
Trump will release his taxes November 9 when the audit is done.  #debatenight
How many times did he just say " I have property there " ? #Debates2016 #ImWithHer
oh yeah donald fondle that microphone like you fondle your cock in my ass #debates
anxiously awaiting for a long vaudeville hook to come out &amp; pull donald trump off stage #Debates2016
Says the guy who has been bankrupt four times... Shut the fuck up, Trump. #Debates2016
Mandatory Gun Background Checks don't prevent Criminals from getting guns. Especially in Colorado.   #copolitics #debatenight
A club in Palm Beach? Is this really happening on a presidential debate?? #Debates2016 #Election2016
I'm honestly surprised that the fear mongering didn't show up sooner. #debatenight
@HillaryClinton @realDonaldTrump #debates show your real face #DonaldTrump don't think running country as a business !!#PresidentialDebate
Remember the good ole days when the worst of poor debate etiquette was checking your watch for the time? #debatenight
If I took a shot every time he said "Chicago" in the past 4 minutes I would be dead of alcohol poisoning right now. 💀#Debates2016 #trumpf
Trumps taxes dont put American lives at risk like the unchecked use of a personal email server does! Hellary for prison! #debatenight nbc
Oh pls Hellary - stop the pandering for the blk vote. They already dont like you - maybe this time they will vote that way #debatenight nbc
He is off the rails. His base will love it though #debatenight
THANK YOU CLINTON. "We have got to address the systemic racism in our justice system. We cannot just say law and order." #Debates2016 👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽
I'm enjoying listening to @DrJillStein Stein "debate" on her own. Wish she and @GovGaryJohnson could be on the stage tonight. #debatenight
"A man who can be provoked by a tweet should not have his &lt;very small&gt; hands near the nuclear codes." #Debates2016
@HillaryClinton brings up the trail of lawsuits and nonpayment @realDonaldTrump has "stiffed" over the years. #debatenight #eccunion
@realDonaldTrump claims any shady dealings on his part are just him playing the game by the rules of the road. #debatenight #eccunion
@HillaryClinton goes back to gun control, pointing out the police are facing military type weapons in criminal hands. #debatenight
Holts tries to pin @realDonaldTrump down on the racial implications of the birther controversy to no avail. #eccunion #Debates2016
@realDonaldTrump says that nuclear weapons are a real threat, greater than global warming. #debatenight #Debates2016 #eccunion
How can she talk about hacking when she was irresponsible with the USA information? #debates
Hilary a boss bitch. Whether you like her or not. She is a woman in the running to become President. That's boss  #debates #Debates2016
Why not just blame Hilary! Hilary why you  cause me to buy these Hammer pants!#debatenight
Wealthy  have had over 30 yrs to have trickle down economics work. Still hasn't worked @realDonaldTrump #debatenight
If you cut out the things Trump said 2, 3 and 4 times, you would condense his jibberish down to about 5 minutes total. #debatenight
TRUMP SNORTED COCAINE BEFORE THE DEBATE THE EVIDENCE IS ALL THERE #sniffsniff #debatenight
#Trump makes a statement followed by a promotion of his businesses. He doesn't think about people first. #debatenight
#Trump is racist by not accepting @POTUS as an American citizen. Racial profiling? #debatenight
The connection to the debate just cut out for me, but I doubt I'm missing anything of substance. #debates
trump's unneccessary ragging on the NYT in the middle of his debate just shows how fucking immature he is  #debatenight
.@HillaryClinton is so condescending and entitled. We vote in America, we aren't a monarchy. We owe you nothing. #JillNotHill #debatenight
Smart Money is on the moderator packing up his stuff and leaving before the end of #debatenight
Did Trump just admit to using legal loopholes to refuse to pay for labor on national TV? #debatenight
hillary: "yes, i did prepare for this debate"   trump: "a very against police judge"  #debates
Was Donald trump about to toungue kiss the mic? Wtf was that? #Debates
It always nice to have a Howard Stern mention at a political debate. #DebateNight
Someone give Trump a thesaurus. His limited vocab is very very bad.  #debatenight
Clinton: There is proof that Trump has not paid federal taxes several years in the past. Trump: That makes me smart. #Debates
#debates. How can a person as absolutely inept as trump even be on this stage. Shame on you Republicans.
He is a broken record- does he even know how the government works? #Debates
OMG Donnie only talks to people who agree with him. So myopic! #Debates
Lol don't learn a lot in tax returns? I'm under leveraged?  #Debates
How will u remedy it mr.trump? Law and order... I watch it too... so how do u do that #Debates
If you didn't get drunk before these debates I feel sorry for you
TRUMPS ARGUMENT STARTED WITH "Clinton didn't want to say two words..." ??? #debatenight
Hillary:  Too many people in our great country.. Me: Great? Ehhhh 3rd world I think  #debatenight
Retweeted Breaking &amp; Entering (@BreakandEnterTV):  Is this a Presidential Debate or Monday Night Raw?! #debatenight
Have you no shame, Dodgin' Donald? Shaming the overweight? You've gone too far! #debatenight
Mentions: 1: Libya  14: ISIS 1: NATO 1: Osama Bin Laden 1: You live in your own reality #Debates2016
This is the most careful paragraph about race and policing that anyone has ever memorized #debatenight
This man comparing airports to justify us being a third world country. Trump. you are so enlightened.  #Debates
equality and the end of oppression are a hell of a lot more important that Trump's twisted, authoritarian view of "law &amp; order" #DebateNight
#Trump kinda just compared opening a hotel on Pennsylvania Ave to running the USA. #Debates2016
Did I miss something - is Obama running for President?  #HillaryClinton is running for President so address her!  #DonaldTrump #Debates2016
Indeed, Donald, the company you've built is unbelievable. As in, I literally can't believe it. At all. #debates
Are we going to talk about the Palestinian Genocide at all? #debatenight
Listening to debates on the radio is fun/disgusting because you can hear just how dry Trump's mouth is. 😷 #Debates2016
"There's some bad things going on, some very bad things" I would like to list the first bad thing is his candidacy in general #Debates
"HE ALSO RAISED THE ISSUE OF YOUR EMAIL, WANNA TALK ABOUT THAT?" #Debates2016
I think #Bigly is one of the drinking words of the night. #DrinkUp @smerconish #DebateNight #Debate2016
@AnushaysPoint @DNAtv @Ali_Gharib you're supposed to take a shot every time he says that.  #DebateNight #Debate2016

"I'm satisfied with the birth certificate because I want to move on!" @realDonaldTrump FANTASTIC! #DebateNight
EVERYTHING Trump has said about NATO is 100% true. Our allies must be held accountable to pay their fair share #debatenight #Trump
It's a shame that America has produced only these 2 for president. Depressing. #Debates
Why doesn't trump know how to wait his turn, chill dude #debatenight
If a booger falls out of his nose I'll chug the entire unopened bottle of vodka that's in my freezer #debatenight
Can the hacker sitting on their bed breaking into #TheCyber weigh 399lbs or 401lbs instead of exactly 400lbs? #Debates #TrumpSniffles
@GovHowardDean yet it's HRC who's drugged up so she won't faint. LOL. MORON! #debatenight #debates
And this???!! In the face of d.trump is running for the highest office of the US???!! #debates
The birth certificate/ISIS transition will be the last bit if this debate i will watch #debatenight I'm done.
But I also don't want to listen to Trump for 4 years either. 😅 #debates
I'm still stuck on the fact that I don't think 'bigly' is a word. #debatenight
#debatenight whose going to tell Trump we don't use the term "3 world" anymore
how about ending the drug war to prevent crime? you won't hear that from either of these two idiots #debatenight
Trump says we need law and order? Really Trump? What are your plans? #Debates
People with a winning temperament: Donald Trump; Charlie Sheen. Both unfit to be president. #debates #USPresidentialDebate
Someone needs to remind this guy that is this is the greatest country in the world. Has, is and will always be great. #debatenight
#debates #debatenight DJT has some key "I'm on shifting ground" statements: believe me, it's a disaster, I can ... all bluster not facts
trump literally sounds like my 12 year old cousin when we're fighting about anything. he has no grace &amp; is childish #Debates
R we really going endure 2 more of these? I can't believe well prepared public servant is going up against a blustering bully. #debatenight
I propose a motion to resurrect FDR, and elect him for a fourth term. All in favor? #debate #debatenight #PresidentialDebate
"you shouldn't have a profit motivation to fill prisons with young Americans"-Hillary on private prisons #debatenight
Honestly, I can't see how somebody not into Politics wouldn't be switching the channels right now. #debatenight
He will literally say anything not to answer the birther question. #Debates2016
"A man who is provoked by a tweet should not have his fingers near nuclear codes." #Debates2016
Trump says he did not support the war in Iraq before the invasion, Holt says the record shows otherwise #debatenight
Lester just failed to chastise the audience for applauding for Hillary...hmm #debatenight
Maybe you're a cheap fucking douche who refuses to pay people what they're owed #Debates
"I think I did a good job" -of course you did #Debates
Welp, Trump just pledged to release his tax returns "when the audit is completed" #debatenight
A little further than half way through the #Debates2016 &amp; what I'm watching seems like something out of a movie
I live in #DC, #ward8, I haven't been shot at walking, driving down the street! You're an asshole! #debate #debatenight @cspan @cnn @msnbc
Yes. Trump. That was actually racial profiling. No one cares if you have property there #DebateNight
Some1 sitting on their bed that weighs 400lbs? what? No way this man is an actual candidate for Pres. Is this an snl skit? #DebateNight
Does Trump know Hillary Clinton hasn't been president for the last thirty years? He needs to watch school house rock. #debates
Trump continues to reference things he "knows" &amp; says he has lists but CAN'T ACTUALLY recall any real facts, things, numbers, etc. #Debates
Hearing "wrong" so much is giving me bad flashbacks to high school math. #debatenight
She's smirking all the way to the White House. This is insane. #DebateNight
#debatenightI have property there.I have businesses there.I'm successful. ANSWER THE QUESTION. BAD, BAD and BAD. @realDonaldTrump #debates
That "WHEW" from Hilary just won the night for me. That's premium quality shade right there. #DebateNight
Harvesting a great crop during #harvest16 seems more productive then the #PresidentialDebate  #debatenight
Trump says he has released an "essentially financial statement of sorts" what the heck is that? #debatenight
@HillaryClinton can we talk about how you will give us free education #debates
So, are we still going to question if Trump is or isn't racist? #debatenight
Oh no..Stephen Hayes was too dangerous at one time for a gun. #debatenight
Raise your hand if you know what Trump is going to say #DebateNight Cyber security
Trump does his best nodding dog impression - and comes out looking more like a lizard with a toupee #Debates2016 #PresidentialDebate
So if I work hard for u #Trump &amp; do what was asked but then you didn't like what YOU told me to do... I shouldn't get paid!?!? #Debates2016
Since when does Trump care about the African-American community? This is new... and sounds insincere #debatenight
Huh @realDonaldTrump WTF are you talking about. You are speaking in riddles! Stick to the topic please #debatenight
What is he talking about? He is better at the rope a dope than Ali! #debatenight
Her saying "trumped up", he rooted for housing crisis, got loan from his dad achieved purpose - got under his skin. #debatenight
#debatenight trump had to bring up the Hillary emails which had nothing to do with the debate. #baitAndSwitch
This is the political equivalent of watching an @AFVofficial video of dads getting hit in the nuts. #Debates2016
Lester needs to ask Trump the tough questions, like why did it take him 8 weeks to fire Gary Busey? #DebateNight
That's the line!!!!! "I was getting prepared to be President of the United States!!! Gooooo Hillary!! #debates
Tbh, Donald Trump and Hilary Clinton had a baby boy named Coriolanus Snow #debatenight
"I made a mistake with deleting the emails"  Oh that's game #debatenight
Nothing better than salty Shillary supporters unfollowing since she's getting BTFO tonight #debatenight
Did Trump just say it made him smart because he didn't pay his taxes??? #debatenight #TrumpVsClinton
The Squawking Satsuma is rambling about bubbles.. Politicians are doing political stuff.. Ok.. #debatenight #debates2016
@SethMacFarlane @SethMacFarlane didn't you back in 2011 say Trump was the best man for the presidency? #debatenight
What do you say about racial healing in this country? "I say nothing." #debatenight
On the reals though, why do politicians keep focusing on the past? Why not focus on what's needed for a better future? #debatenight
#Trump checks Hannity to figure out if he was for or against the Iraq war. Shit is getting deep 'round here. #DebateNight #LyingOrangeClown
.@realDonaldTrump wont pay 'unsatisfactory' work yet brags how unbelievable all his bldgs are #trumpfraud #Debates2016
If I had paid taxes"it would be squandered" Trump How would we run our country if all thought like that? What kind of model is he? #debates
There are lots of drinking games being referenced on my Twitter timeline. Tomorrow is going to be painful for a lot of people. #debatenight
I don't believe Trump has as many friends as he says he does. And if he does, I don't really care what they think. #debatenight
"According to a report I just read." Like literally it's on my podium right here. #debatenight
What's happening in Chicago is bad because Trump has property there. #debatenight
Trump: I am against all N acronyms. NAFTA and NATO can just fuck right off. Also NANO, just in case. #Debates2016
"We'll put a boot in your ass that's the American way" Toby Keith  "We have to knock the hell out of ISIS" DJT  #DebateNight

Yes it was Bush who started the war that creates Isis. Is this not common knowledge? #Debates2016
Donald Trump proposes we should have taken the oil out of the middle east. #debatenight
This whole campaign was just a way for Trump to try to get Law and Order back on the air. Maybe he's not a bad guy after all. #Debates2016
What does someones weight has to do with anything?  Get this joker out of there #DebateNight #ImWithHer
I'm not too sure he given "lots of thought" to anything  #debates
Trump you have never cared about this issue before you ran for president. I see right through you. #debatenight
HRC- True fact. Trump- Your wrong. I'm going to hold my breath until you agree with me. #Debates2016
Did Lester Holt leave the room? I mean, I wouldn't blame him if he did. #debatenight #Debates2016
Oh I'm sorry, you didn't get the memo? The #PresidentialDebate ended with the "I prepared to be President" line.  #debatenight #debates
They both are sucking on the topic of race; but Trump sounds like an out of touch racist idiot. #debatenight
So selective gun-bans are Trump's stance on the gun problem..how very constitutional. #debatenight
HA- "all talk no action sounds good doesn't work"- dude, that's you. @realDonaldTrump #debatenight #Debates2016
@realDonaldTrump- you do realize that infrastructure is funded by taxes which you refuse to pay, right? #debatenight #Debates2016
"had we taken the oil ISIS would not have been able to form". um... what? #debatenight #Debates2016
When someone is constantly saying "believe me" you probably shouldn't believe them #Debates2016
I am running for President! I have answered as many questions as these two! #VoteforPhillip #debatenight
"They have information we can't get anywhere else." Hillary makes the plain-language case for not bashing Muslims #debatenight
Lol Trump is sniffing more than that one kid during silent reading in English class 😂😂😂😂 #debatenight
The #Debates2016 expected nothing less nothing more. Frightened over future of USA! Vote @barackobama third term, if only that were possible
#Trump proudly has an American flag pin on...Guess Hillary didn't want to offend anybody #AmericaFirst #makeamericagrateagain  #Debates2016
Hillary&amp; her like do nothing but talk the game but do nothing. When I say Im going to build something I build it ~ @realDonaldTrump #debates
If @HillaryClinton can't secure her email, how can she protect US against cyber-attackers? #debatenight #PresidentialDebate
Hillary wants to support Kurds like Obama. That will only strain Turkish-US relations. Don't know what Trump thinks #Debates #debatenight
"y-you should have paid to rebuild america yourself!" is she pretending to be retarded #debatenight #debates
Dude you told Russia to go into Hillary's emails.. Am I the only one that remembers this? #Debates2016
Who had "Trump mentions NRA endorsement" on their debate bingo? Drink up cause he won't let it go. #debatenight
And you decided to stay home?!?  Oh fuck no. Oh fuck fuck no. Oh no you don't. #Debates2016 #ImWithHer
He’s so out of touch. 650 million dollars isn’t a lot of money? I wouldn’t mind having that little money. UGH. #debatenight
.@HillaryClinton is 70 Isis hasn't been around her entire adult life.   #debatenight #debates #Debates2016
Hey @HillaryClinton, if you're going to talk about the people he didn't pay, talk about the students he cheated too. #debatenight
Would like less patting selves on the back re: Middle Eastern policy, more serious look at our "friendship" with Saudi Arabia. #debatenight
Trump to @LesterHoltNBC on stop-and-frisk targeting Blacks and Latinos: "No, you're wrong" #debatenight
I'm burning with rage. "These are bad people." Fuck you, Donald. You're the bad person. #debatenight
#debatenight I'm from the African American community and I wish Donald Trump would choke on his spit and die.
'We need Law and Order in this country.'   'In the criminal justice syste-  *DUN DUN* '  #debatenight
"Secretary Clinton hasn't used two words that I learned by watching TV: Law and Order." #Debates2016
What exactly is an "African American Hispanic," Trump? Oh right, minorities are all the same to you. #Debates2016
Why did you challenge Obama on his birth certificate?  Trump: Isis, build a wall 😂 He's actually a caricature #Debates2016
I keep saying, BAD SPANISH TRADUCERS!!! I can't use SAP on this one. #Debates2016
yes 400 pound couch hackers are the huge national security threat of today #debatenight
Trump is having some tremendously beautiful adverse reactions to the hillpill  #Debates2016
"That makes me smart."  If I have to pay my taxes, I think the President should have to pay his taxes. #Debates2016
"A very against police judge" !??!!? What is this guy saying #Debates2016
Wow - Trump had Killary on the ropes with ISIS, and Holt is baling her out. Biased much, Lester? #debatenight
Trump saying he has a better temperament than Secretary Clinton is subtle sexism to e idc #Debates
Not paying federal income tax doesn't make you smart, @realDonaldTrump. It makes you a mooch. #debatenight
Is Trump really going all-in on this argument that HRC started the birther movement??? #debatenight #imwithher
400lbs sitting on a couch hacking data, now Trump is blaming Chris Christie? #debatenight
Seriously, I don't get it America. Why Donald Trump is even a choice? #debatenight
Damn Trump, are you saying it will be another 15 years before you release your Tax Returns? #debatenight
Claiming credit for the birth certificate to this day is one of the most offensive things in politics today #debates
unfortunately, looking at twitter atm it's not actually all that popular #debatenight
How long does an IRS tax audit last? Answer the question 😱 #Debates2016 #ImWithHer
#debatenight Hillary has on red and Trump has a blue tie. Who's side are they on?
Aye Hilary, you know we didn't forget about the 94 Crime Bill right? Right!? #DebateNight
Suddenly you talk like Linda Richman on Coffee Talk? On Stop and Fisk? #debatenight
@realDonaldTrump's losing it....watch your temper Donny-boy....Stop interrupting and she won't interrupt you #Doublestandard #debatenight
Hey guys, we came up with the internet. Which means we're the only ones who are supposed to be tech literate #debatenight
We will never see his tax returns. Never. He's been saying "I will if or when..." for years. #debates
He basically said black people are bad, as if he's any better! #debatenight
Yeah Hillary, Donald may have conflicts of interest....  BUT we KNOW you do and your families foundation does. #debatenight
Hillary apologizes for her email and takes responsibility, BUT has done everything to hide them.  I DON'T CALL THAT APOLOGIZING #debatenight
So thankful for snapchat filters. Only thing good about this #debatenight is seeing both of them look as ridiculous as they sound
I didn't know a giant douche could talk but I also didn't know a turd sandwich could delete emails #debatenight
Every time he says "tremendous," he means "I have no idea how much." #Debates2016
Yeah, we've become a third world country, thanks to trickle down philosophy #Debates
People love the idea of stop and frisk, unless they're the ones always stopped and frisked. #Debates
jfc Trump just because other people did it doesn't mean it's suddenly okay #debatenight #Debates2016
How many folks are doing live fact checking? Can't be too hard, right?  #DebateNight #FactCheckTheDebate
Instead of #debates can we watch a live broadcast of these 2 taking the US Citizenship Test? #debatenight
Wish Trump would quit interrupting Hillary and let her spit out what she's trying to say #debatenight
ATTACK HIS ACHILLES HEEL BABY YOU GO AFTER THAT TAX RETURNS #debatenight
@realDonaldTrump can we get the #orangehitler hashtag going please? This man will kill us all #debates #USPresidentialDebate #debatenight
Line of the night is when Donald Trump suggested a 400 pounder on a bed could be hacking Clinton's campaign. That's gold. #Debates2016
Moderator: What is your response to saying our Preside needs to produce his birth certificate? Trump: ISIS, ISIS, ISIS!  #debatenight
I hear there's rumors on the, uh, internets. —George W. Bush #debatenight #debates
I feel like Trump's tax returns are this elections Obama's birth certificate. #debatenight #Debates2016 Can we move on already?
You should stiff a worker if you're unsatisfied with his or her work? That's a heck of a justification. #debatenight
They need to put a shock collar on Trump and zap his rude ass when he interrupts. #debatenight
I think we should have a prohibition on unconstitutional lists but like.. #debatenight
@RevoltTV yes! Trump is the dope beat w/ no lyrics. #clinton is about rhymes n substance. Money vs character. #debatenight
"I built an unbelievable company" Finally Trump speaks truth-"unbelievable" is exactly right,until we see tax records #debates #debatenight
He wants the Regan Era back... all gangs are illegal immigrants? #debatenight
"We need to move on" -moderator ..... LET TRUMP speak.   #Debates
I live in an integrated neighborhood, used to be traditionally AA. I'M LIVING IN HELL, apparently. #Debates2016
Uh, Trump, the stock market didn't look so hot this week.  #debates
Trump, "The African-American community has been let down by politicians."  No shit.  Politicians have let us ALL down.  #debates
Lester gotta tell Trump to stfu, it's getting out of hand #Debates2016 #debates
The nuclear and the cyber...like the nexus and the olive tree?  #debatenight #FeelTheBern #HFA
"I have a much better temperament than she does" LIES...you the only one YELLING #Debatenight
#thatmakesmesmart @realDonaldTrump about not paying much taxes 😂She wants to see what he's hiding but deleted 30,000 emails!! #debates
"I have to respond!" IS HE JUST NOW LEARNING HOW DEBATES WORK #debatenight
Trump has that connection, but was sacred to come to to our hometowns😂😂 #debatenight
when does @mattlightcomedy come out with a beer truck and hit both candidates with a stunner? #debatenight
Just like teachers, which of our candidates will take care of our police force? #debatenight
Yes Hillary lets see most all the people who did.these things were Muslim imagrints #Debates
First part of debate was like bickering siblings. Second part has been much more civil, which is nice. Will it last? (No). #DebateNight
Trump is a slimeball; Hillary's smart to remind people of it. #Debates2016
He can't handle it. He's literally bringing up Bernie who endorses  #DebateNight
I opened a club. I didn't admit guilt. I got the birth certificate. I. I. I. #debatenight
Trump hasnt had to go this hard. This far in a debate. His MO is yelling. Context not strong. Only getting worse. #Debates2016 #debatenight
The moment when Hillary decides to just hang out and let Trump get rekt by himself #debatenight
@pinkomegas So...Is your president a twat? Either way we go(@realDonaldTrump or @HillaryClinton)...ours will be. #Debates
Obviously we need to bring back the original Law &amp; Order! Only @samwaterston can save us. #debatenight #lawandorder
Hillary wins the hair debate hands down. Where does she get her highlights done? #debatenight
Why can't they talk about the country rather than bitching at each other? #debatenight
But she didn't mention the trends of thousands of people that love me #DebateNight
He can name things all day long did you know that...wow #debatenight
If Donald Trump interrupts Hilary saying "wrong" one more time... shut up! You sound like a 5 year old. #debates
Where is the cone of silence for him? Jeez...shut up already. I would love to see a moderator who would take control. #debatenight
I'm scared she is too smug.  He is a frighteningly real threat. #debatenight
To be fair, Hillary already used "Super predators" which is way more hardcore than "law and order" #Debates2016
I give Donald that one burn. Just one. The rest is pure petulance. #debatenight #clintonemails #dumptrump
Lester is doing a better job fighting back against Trump than Hillary. #debatenight
The venue's gotta smell like freshly spread manure after Trump's birther self-defense. #DebateNight
Smh. The debate is disappointing from both sides. We're screwed 2016. #debates #debatenight
Trump really just wants stop-and-frisk to be allowed at his beauty pageants. #DebateNight
Trump was endorsed by ICE from the dispenser in his refrigerator. #debatenight
Honestly, Trump could have debated against a mirror and still lost. #debatenight
Hillary talking about ending private prisons when she took massive amounts of money from them. Hypocrite. #Debatenight #debates
Lester is getting bullied by Trump too much. Lester put some bass in your voice and stop getting cut off my Trump! #debatenight
Will Lester Holt please ask Trump what he's ever done for the African American community? #debates
So at what point does @BernieSanders charge the stage and save the day? #debatenight #debates #Debates2016 #Trump #Clinton
Did #DonaldTrump just say that America would be a better country if we were more like China or Saudi Arabia? #debatenight #debates2016
I feel like I should have paid for pay per view for this debate.... #boxing #debatenight
He is SO childish! I don't want him as my president! #cnn #debatenight #debates #debates2016 We don't CARE ABOUT THESE EMAILS. #trump #HRC
#debates @realDonaldTrump @HillaryClinton Trump missed the opportunity about taking the Libyan pres. and loss of 4ameticans in Benghazi
Hillary looking into the camera like "are u seeing this shit" #debatenight
(He knows we have a black president... right? Who fulfilled 70% of his campaign promises? Right?) #DebateNight
How... insulting is it to prepare for a job for so many years and then have to interview next to a giant boob with a mouth. #DebateNight
Am I the only one that thinks that #Trump is braging about himself and his companys?? #Debates
#JerryWhite: If there was real "law and order," the two people on the stage would be behind bars #debates #debatenight #Debates
He only knows how to talk about himself, his business  #Debates
so she basically said that he didn't rent his apartments to black people? to which he didn't deny 😶 #debatenight
Moderator: birth certificate was released in 2011, you kept pushing it. Trump says he got the certificate, Clinton started it #debatenight
Much respect for Sec. Clinton facing the question, saying she would have handled the email differently and not making excuses. #debatenight
I'm getting so many politician accounts in my timeline lol. Don't hate me new political twitter people! #debatenight
Trump just muttered "that makes me smart" as Clinton points out his not paying taxes. #Debates2016
I'm really REALLY trying to put myself in the mind of a trump supporter to gather an understanding....Just.cant.do.it #Debates2016
I'm African-American, and I don't live in Hell. Just putting that out there. #debatenight #Debates2016
Dear Donald's debate coach: might want to focus on finishing sentences coherently. Probably less cocaine before coming out, 2. #debatenight
Bad ppl? The police officers are the ones shooting and civilians are the one dying. Who are the bad ppl here? It's the Popos #debatenight
This really is a proper politician against an SNL character. It's terrifying people take him seriously #DebateNight
'Trying to save the money.' I'm thinkin' you don't have any money for tv ads. #DonaldTrump #debatenight
Some countries of NATO aren't paying their fair share? Kinda like you, Mr. Trump! #donaldtrump #debatenight
Trump repeated the phrase, "I agree with Hillary" so many times tonight. #debatenight
"I have a feeling (…) I'm going to be blamed for everything…" "Why not?"  #debatenight
Trump is so proud to be endorsed by the terrible generals that he's smarter than. #Debates2016
Next on Blues Clues, Trump finds Obama's birth certificate in the handy dandy mailbox. #Debates2016
Why didn't Lester Holt correct the cheering audience for Clinton? Hmm... #debatenight #Debates2016
Gang violence a part of Trump's anti-crime initiatives, along with illegal immigrant criminals, stop-and-frisk #debatenight #Debates2016
"The Middle East is a total mess" and no thanks to you, says Trump to Clinton #debatenight #Debates2016
#debates2016 I will do everything possible to take out leadership of ISIS. - @Hillaryclinton
#debatenight #Debates2016 Bankruptcy  6 times?, he is going to run the country into bankruptcy. You can't put him in Whitehouse.
@realDonaldTrump says many NATO countries not paying fair share. And NATO could be obsolete because they don't focus on terror #debatenight
"I've been yelling for a full hour now, but I have the better temperament." #debatenight
The Cyber! The Donald uses the security question to brag about his 10 year old sons computer prowess. Huh? #debatenight
Great answer @HilliaryClinton on implicit bias. I  couldn't have said it better. #debatenight #Debates2016
If you sorry mother fuckers don't vote Gary Johnson in november, we're all doomed. #debatenight #debates #Debates2016
This is the part of the debate when Trump completely loses the black vote #debatenight
Someone told Hillary Clinton to "smile" and it's kind of creepy. #debatenight
Did anyone else hear Trump say "you was totally out of control" yep that correct English #Debates
Meh. In fairness to Trump he's not wrong that the #IranDeal paves the way for #Iran to become the dominant regional power. #Debates2016
Trump ignores that guns confiscated in 0.15% of stops &amp; frisks. I.e. #stopandfrisk totally ineffective for gun control   #debates #nydebates
How can Trump be the leader of a system he's subverted for years? #DemDebate #debatenight
Trump: Belive me. The Prince of Eypt: There can be miracles when you belie-- Bystander: SHUT UP #debatenight
So his answer to every question is going to start with "I have just now been endorsed by..." Fuck outta here clown! #Debates2016
Donald just sidestepped Clinton's slam about being surprised that he invited Russians to hack into American emails. #Debates2016
"That makes me smart." What a greedy POS! Will the fools who believe 47% of dems don't pay taxes flip out on Trump over this? #debatenight
Trump agrees with Clinton (on no guns for people on no-fly list). Possibly first time, possibly only time ever. #debatenight
Watching the debate gives me headaches. Sounds like Trump loves the sound of his own voice #debatenight
#Debates2016  The moderator should have been a woman because Lester is afraid of Trump.
Girl, I'm like what?!?!  RT @Uneesmiles: Sooooooo our airports looks like 3rd world  countries according to Trump #debatenight
Last time I checked the Chicago airport is the bees knees and Kabul is, the what, a palace? #debatenight
He has no no clue what she's talking about. I wish we had a thought bubble over his head. #Debates2016 #PartyofLincoln
The Donald needs to actually say something instead of just generalizing everything.... Wow 😈 #debatenight
It's ok Donald. I always have to yell at people about how I have good temperament too. #DebateNight #Debates2016
Can't wait to hear all of the people who don't know anything about politics shout their opinions on social media. #debatenight
This is grim. She's baited him throughout and it's totally worked. @realDonaldTrump meltdown #debatenight
out of 700,000 stop&amp;frisks in NY 53% of the people were black &amp; 9% were white so tell me again how that isn't racial profiling #debatenight
#debatenight @realDonaldTrump AGAIN, DO NOT "agree" w/your opponent. You took the steam out of super predator as well when you did it. 😣
Say what you want about Canadian politics, it's NOT this.  Not even a little.  #debatenight  #cdnpoli
"I have a much better temperament than her though" Keep telling yourself that Donald, you're the only one that believes it #debatenight
"A man who can be provoked by a tweet should not have his fingers anywhere near the nuclear codes." #debatenight
Wow, did Trump just threaten to eminent domain the white house if elected? #debatenight
"Clinton doesn't want to use a couple of words. She's afraid of what'll happen. I am too. Thats why they're the Unspeakables." #debatenight
Did trump just create a hypothesis as to why African Americans vote democrat #debatenight
Clinton is playing this race segment very safe, but she's giving stats and a plan of action. Trump, is not. #Debates2016
A man who would be provoked by a tweet should not have his hands anywhere near the nuclear codes - Clinton. #debatenight #PresidentialDebate
Be careful you two... Lester Holt knows how to slap a bass, so he won't hesitate to cut a fool #debatenight
Donald Trump "I say nothing" I agree with you, Donald, that you always say nothing! #debatenight
If it's true that @realDonaldTrump agrees SOOO much with @HillaryClinton he should vote for her!!!! #debate #debatenight
Wouldn't it make more sense for a BUSINESS MAN to run our economy than a career politician? #debates
Why have there been no questions on Benghazi.. emails.. Clinton foundation (middle east money)? Fair questions?#debatenight
US American political #Debates Clinton with Trump. Direct live debates are very important for today's Democracy.
At what point are we gonna get into the real issues, like the ban on sports betting, online poker, and Daily Fantasy Sports? #debatenight
What does their body language say about this debate? Does it work for either candidate? #LaGHUC106 #Debates2016
What messaging guru thought “trumped up trickle down” was a good catch phrase? Someone find them and neck-punch them. #debatenight
Gotta give it to Hillary, she’s pretty good at needling Trump thus far. #debatenight
Hillary is making minced meat of Trump. This is fun to watch. Prepare next time, asshole. #debatenight
"I practiced for this debate. And I think that's a good thing."#debatenight
Bully baby, guess what?It's not all about money.Only those with no soul think the only  important thing is money. #Debates2016 #debatenight
Trump: I opposed Iraqi War. Holt: "The record shows otherwise." Trump: I was just kidding around with Howard Stern. #debatenight
Lester Holt..Reminding the AUDIENCE of the rules? Son, let's do some classroom management here with interruptions! #debatenight #Debates2016
Lets talk about all the people in Haiti Hillary and her foundation "stiffed" #debatenight
Hillary is spreading misinformation. Police don't systematically target blacks it's statistically proven. #debates
@HillaryClinton how exactly do you plan to stop people from using the Internet? #debatenight
#debatenight I am not for Trump, but he looks better on stage than Mrs Doubt fire... Or cough-a-lot-clinton as she's known
I've formed relationships "for the last... little while" with African Americans. #DebateNight
So to sum up this whole debate: We're not doing what we should be doing.I opened a club + taking over the post office. China. #debatenight
Airports don't mark whether you're a developed or developing country  I can't believe I can type that  #Debates2016 #debatenight
All debates are is a preconceived idea of how you feel towards each candidate and picking things out you like your candidate said.
I'm waiting for Hillary to become so disgusted that she asks for Huma to hand her a bottle of #SkinnyGirl and she swigs it. #debatenight
"As far as the lawsuit..." SNIFF "I have been given great credit" for opening a club in Palm Beach? Which makes me not racist? #debatenight
@realDonaldTrump is melting down he cant control him self lmfaooooo  he sound like a crazy person #debates
Is this a debate? Is this the Office? Is this SNL? Some1 lmk #debates
Grab your popcorn, get a good seat, and watch the show when #Benghazi gets brought up. #debatenight
So #trump "took advantage of laws" but admonished Clinton staffers for invoking the 5th amendment? I don't understand anything #Debates2016
I can mock every single hand gesture trump makes before he makes it #debatenight
"I think implicit bias is a problem for everyone, not just police." @HillaryClinton #debates
"Knock the hell out of ISIS, and fast" bit bland on details but yeah that should defs restore peace in the Middle East Don #debatenight
Lester needs to ask how many botox shots each candidate took. #stolethisfromabigailkatherine #debatenight
I think this is the first time Howard Stern has ever come up in a presidential debate #debatenight #debates
Donald Trump is taking credit for fighting for the birth certificate that was there all along. Fucking hero. #debates
I'm ready for Trump to start debating Lester Holt now. He's punch-drunk. #debates
@callificent I'm ashamed to see that this is what our country's become!  How is HE on this stage!?!  How did we get here! #debatenight
Can Lester speak up and tell Trump to answer the fucking question instead of just repeating facts #howyougonnafixthis #debatenight
Trump has done nothing but ramble all night long. He has not made one valid point. #debatenight
Hillary owns up to making a mistake with the email server. Best answer so far tonight. #debatenight
Could we maybe discuss your plans about the future of the USA? Or is this just a school fight about who is the not the worst ? #debatenight
Hillary has been chill he's the one who's been yelling and attacking this whole time 😂 #Debates
He's using very coded racist language and it's terrifying... "these people..." "bad people"... #debatenight
Trump has a hard-on for "paying [your] fair share". Release those tax docs so I know that you're paying your fair share, too. #debatenight
So we're supposed to believe his  memory of his income? Still won't release his taxes. ##debatenight
She wore red. He wore blue. Coincidence? I wish they were in a cage match! #debatenight
Just love the way @HillaryClinton refers to herself as a middle class family give me a break #DebateNight #NeverHillary
"One murder is too many."   WHAT ABOUT THE FOUR MEN YOU GOT MURDERED IN BENGHAZI??   #debates
Hillary really just needs to fight him. Right there. Throw it down. #debatenight
He lost his Dignity when he had to make a deal with Putin on Syria #Debates
@CNN #debatenight  Donald Trump don't know about politics. Hillary Clinton knows about politics.
The fact that Trump can't let her talk for 2 seconds w/o interrupting..  #Debates
Someone call @seanhannity and ask him about the time last decade I told him the Cubs were totally going to crush it in 2016 #debatenight
is he talking about the inner cities or iraq? this guy has no clue. #debatenight
@realDonaldTrump Hillary is over 60 years old. So she's been an adult since the 1960s. ISIS has existed three years... #DebateNight
Can he work for refugees,they are refugees because of united nations. #Debates
The race question. "A great nation faces its flaws and corrects them" - Pres. George W. Bush #debatenight #TxAKAsTakeAction #BeTheVoice
What an idiot. Racial profiling is real Mr. Trump! #debates Stop and frisk does NOT work.
#Trump on #Russia's state-directed hacking: "Russia? It could be someone sitting on their bed that weighs 400 pounds." #DebateNight
Clinton is winning the debate just on poise alone. I mean Sheesh!  #debates #debatenight
Dear IRS... Can you please hurry up and finish Donald Trump's audit so that he can release his tax returns. Thanks!!!  #Debates2016
Hillary is calm &amp; level-headed. Trump is a hot-head, he's shouting, groaning/sighing, etc. This dude is a joke. #debatenight
I'm Wondering how many Households are yelling "SHUT THE HELL UP" @realDonaldTrump you SUCK at Debating .... #YaHeard !?! #Debates2016
30 minutes in #Debates2016 How can this be even? I respectfully disagree with the #GOP #pov But cannot respect their #candidate. I Miss Mitt
Is Trump talking about a tv show or politics? Who knows? #debatenight
Trump's fact checker is just one of those Old McDonald spinning wheel toys for kids. Except every animal is a pig. #Debates2016
We Need law and order...  But not for me, cos I don't pay taxes. Yup fella. You thought that one out loud!  #debatenight
it's a little cakey, but the orange undertone is great. and that nude lip?? boiiii is that a kylie kit? #debatenight
GWBush made the agreement on when to leave Iraq, not President Obama @realDonaldTrump #Debates2016
"My temperament is better than Clinton's, it's one of my strongest assets." Is Trump high? #debatenight
Hillary should be allowed to play a drinking game during this debate, too. #debatenight
Here we go......emails!   I knew it was coming.  #Debates2016 #debatenight
When Barack leaves and goes to play golf for the rest his life... what?#Debates2016
When conservatives say "law and order" they mean "these blacks are out of line" #DebateNight
Trump: "We should have taken the oil" - what, all of it? And put it where exactly? #debatenight
I knew he was gonna bring up the super predator. He thinks it will throw @HillaryClinton off. #debatenight #debate2016
So how are we supposed to pay for airports, roads &amp; bridges when the ultra-rich like @realDonaldTrump avoid paying taxes? #DebateNight
For the love of God would someone please call Sean Hannity?!?! #debatenight
The #debatenight OMG @realDonaldTrump ANSWER THE  Question!!!! Poor @HillaryClinton She Has To Compete With This Babbling Nut! #DumpTrumpNOW
Love my girl Hill but I'm a little nervous if she says his name aloud again the lip of hell will swallow us whole. Beetlejuice! #debatenight
Respect for Hillary Clinton; I'm pretty sure I would have rolled my eyes so much by now that they'd stick that way. #DebateNight #MomThreats
i'm grateful to the Protocols of Elders of Zion for putting that whole Jews run the world thing to bed too #debatenight
Aww did Trump study a single, racist, non-constitutional policy to discuss tonight? #debatenight
Donald Trump is singling out my city &amp; I'm not ok with this! #chicago #howarewelikeferguson #whyisnthepickingonahighercrimeratecity #debates
Smh so why isn't the libertarian nominee here cause I wanna here from them. #debatenight
#Braggadocious is a great word, is that was he really said? Oh no. #Debates2016
'I'll release my tax returns when you release your 33,000 emails'-Donald Trump  Boom #DebateNight
Did a presidential candidate just quote an interview w/Howard Stern (awesome show but...) during a debate ? 😳#Debates2016
I think stop and frisk would really help with the racial tensions in this country right now. 🙄#Debates2016
Hillary is like, problematic white fav of this debate. Problematic, yes. Less problematic than Trump though. #debatenight
Trump is literally the most annoying human on the planet. I want someone to stuff a sock in his mouth. #debatenight
Did trump just ask why we didn't get North Korea to saction Iran?#debatenight
Why he needs to mention all the people that endorsed him all the time #Debates
But do you have property in Ferguson, @realDonaldTrump? Didn't think so. #Debates #NeverTrump --let him keep talkin...it's only helping HRC.
drumpf wants to lose at this point. It's like he literally just realized that his "money" got him this far. He's scared to death. #debates
Wait wait wait....Wasn't this a simple question?  Why is Patty getting dragged into this?  Poor Patty. #debatenight
This #debatenight is making me furious. There's no way The Flash is faster than Sonic the Hedgehog, OK Hillary?
#Debates Hey may be sniffing, but #Trump didn't pass out and get replaced by a look-a-like!  No WH Harrison repeat! No #Clinton's VP
#Debates INVESTING IN OUR CITIZENS, OUR CHILDREN, OUR FUTURE, OUR INFRASTRUCTURE! Not deals for billionaires...
#Debates #taxreturns mean nothing. What I say without documents to back it is what matters. I have enough money to build the #DeathStar!
HRC's response to this race/police question is MUCH better/stronger than her first response. #debatenight
Is that a polluted cloud or is that supposed to be Trump's actual bangs? #debatenight 😕
#Debates2016 @realDonaldTrump is just like our very own @Justiceforwv not in a good way #peopleHaveThePower @Pritt4WVGov @manypennytweets
sorry i'm not watching #debatenight i just got to season 3 of @ScandalABC on @netflix...
I began the debate with an open mind, with no prior bias, and all I've heard is Trump ramble with no substance, unlike Clinton. #debatenight
Trump says he has a better temperament than Clinton, and the audience laughs. #debatenight #debates #Debates2016
"I have a much better temperament." ~ Trump  Shit that happens when he's pushing one out in the toilet.   #RomInterpreter #debatenight
Am I watching @VeepHBO, family members squabbling, or the presidential debate? I'm dying right now...#debatenight
He's an idiot. "Duh, I have the best temperament. I'm not going to talk about NATO or anything of import."  #Debates2016 #ImWithHer #TGFH
#debates AND HILLARY POINTS OUT THE FUNDAMENTAL UNCONSTITUTIONALITY OF THE NO-FLY LIST.
Wait, he opened a club and he's proud of it? And that will make him a good president? #debatenight
If I was @HillaryClinton I would have rolled my eyes out of my head. #DebateNight #Debates2016
Only #DonaldTrump could be THAT proud of himself for not discriminating against anyone in his club. #Debates2016
This is the first time I've ever wished that I did have to watch commercials. #debates #Debates2016
"They talk good..." It's painful beyond a political sense. English teachers everywhere are cringing more and more every minute #debatenight
Hey @kanyewest &amp; @chancetherapper @realDonaldTrump is saying all kinds of crazy things about your city. #Debates
Somebody get Donald his medication. The #ShortFingeredVulgarian is shouting non-stop during the #debates. #UnhingedLunatic.
#debatenight Simple Definition of temperamental: likely to become upset or angry. : unpredictable in behavior or performance. MerriamWebstr
"We have gangs that roam the streets" yeah and they endorsed you right? Fraternal Order of Police? KKK? #debatenight
"I think my strongest asset, maybe by far, is my temperament." - Trump Really? Are you really sure about that? 🤔 #debatenight  #ImWithHer
"We came in with the Internet, we came up with the Internet." What? What language is this? #djt #Debates2016
SOMEONE GET THIS MAN A MINT OR MOUTH MOISTENER OR SOMETHING IM EXTREMELY UNCOMFORTABLE #debatenight #Debates2016
America, let's be in on the #DrinkingGame taking the globe by storm. Every time @realDonaldTrump #Sniffs -- We drink! #debates #debatenight
Hilary just slammed him. "Anyone who can be provoked by a tweet should not have his hands anywhere near the nuclear codes" #debatenight
Is this for real? #debatenight for trump is literally just to get off the topic for everything. Wrong. Wrong.
"You know what I prepared for? I prepared to be president" #Debates
you disrespected Obama during the debates! oh wait, that was me. - trump #debatenight
So @realDonaldTrump says he doesn't mind releasing his tax returns, then distracts people by saying PS I RICH. #Debates2016
Did he just say he was endorsed by ICE?  #debatenight  #PresidentialDebate  #Debates2016
"you learn a lot from financial disclosure" yes, like the fact that you're a lying, cheating, sneaky piece of shit #debatenight
Keep Calm Donald. In 18 min you will be able to pee all the water you have been drinking... #Debates
This is a train wreck and it's only 30 mins in. #Debates2016
If Donald Trump had common sense like he says he does he would know it's rude to interrupt people when they are speaking #debatenight
Hillary is a matador tonight and Donald is FULL OF BULL. #debatenight
"It's really unfortunate that he paints such a dire picture of Black community in this country," @HillaryClinton  Trump grunts #debatenight
Truly, where are you Barack? I am writing you in for a 3rd term @POTUS #SAVEUSBARACK #Debates2016
Ohhhhh! We need Law &amp; Order! Thank God he solve that problem! It means the TV show right? With Sam Waterson? #Debates2016
NRA are very very good people guys! Donald just said that, so it must be true. #Debates2016
If we had just taken the oil! Guys we just needed to take the oil! #debatenight #isissolved
I hope the fact checkers are turning up with their own debate drinking game #debatenight
Lester, please ask Donald what NATO stands for because I doubt he does #debatenight
And you Americans honestly think Trump is going to help reduce violence and police brutality with his anti-minority mindset? #Debates2016
The only thing that's worse than ignorance is PRIDE in your ignorance.. @realDonaldTrump #debatenight
Trumps plan will raise the deficit much more than clintons plan #shewon #ImWithHer #Debates2016
Stop and frisk???? law and Order? Wrong you need GUN CONTROL. Genius #ImWithHer #Debates2016
Yeah I'm sure our airports are like 3rd world countries. What a fucktard. #debatenight
You said something. Then you apologized for it. But I think you were wrong to do it. So let me remind you of it, and revisit it. #debates
"...great relations in the last little while*..." *when it was convenient for me @realDonaldTrump #DebateNight #debate #PresidentialDebate
#KenobiandSkywalker2016 because these two on stage came straight out of a comic book #Debates
Trump is now saying that Hillary Clinton was insufficiently respectful of her opponent during the 2008 debates. Just soak that in.
I don't think HRC is going to last the full 90 mins!! She seems to be zoning out #debatenight
"The security aspect of cyber" - $10 says he lets his 10 year old control this "cyber" he's talking about. #Election2016 #debates
Whatever Trump says in the media only serves the purpose of Trump being in the media #birthcertificate #trump #debates
This started with a story about Howard Stern, jumped to Hannity. What the actual fuck, man? #debatenight
Trump Worry More About His Investors Than He Do With Innocent Black People Getting Killed 🙄 #debatenight
@realDonaldTrump Does @HillaryClinton know what bait &amp; release means? I don;t care about taxes. Once again, where r those emails? #debates
What the fuck is Cyber? The only time my generation used the word Cyber was for Cyber Sex.... #debates
how DOES she hold it together!? i'm...SNIFFFF....better at nuclear than she is. #debatenight
With hair like that you can't run nothing but dog fights @realDonaldTrump #debatenight
wait so i thought not paying taxes made you a criminal but apparently it makes you smart?? im adulting wrong #debates
How about we talk about what you'll actually DO for the country? Good lord. #debatenight
#Debates neither of them directly spoke about the shooting of the black people, by police. But they were diplomatic and political.
Yes, we have armed gangs roaming the streets. They are called the police. #debatenight #debates #Debates2016
I'm almost speechless. Sean Hannity?? I will never get this hour of my life back! #Debates
Bumming hard at the idea of a #POTUS who thinks it's "smart" to evade taxes #Debates2016
Hillary: To many of us jump to conclusions abt each other. #unconsciousbias #debatenight
Oh yeah, release the 33,000 emails and I will release my tax returns.  Ha, suck on that BIOTCH!!  #debatenight
Yes, let's not jail a person based on skin color. SWELL idea open border #Killary   #Debates2016
"I prepared for this debate like I prepared to be president" - @HillaryClinton #ImWithHer #Debates
Donald Trump: "We [America] lose on everything." That's not my America. #debates
This will sadly as a draw. Assess it as total non-partisan. #debatenight
'What will we do to heal race relations?'  'We need law &amp; order! I have investments in Charlotte!' #debatenight
Lester: "Can I say something?"  Trump/Clinton: "NO!"  Finally. We have UNITY!!!!!  #debates #Debates2016
Trump: money money, taxes, I have incomes, I have companies, look at my money, talk to some banks about me, income money $$$  #debatenight
I like Hillary's low heels. It says "I'm still a woman but I'm not gauche." #debatenight
This debate had more China in it than my Bubbie's wedding dowry #debatenight
Law and Order.  Red meat for Donald's racist base -- it's code! #Debates2016 #Election2016 #debatenight
Underleveraged, paying taxes, made $600m, then show your income tax return!  #debatenight
He starts off everything with "they endorse me. Very proud of that" 🙄#debatenight
Close your doors, Americans. Trump has the backing of the border patrol! #Debates2016 #ClintonTrumpDebate
CLINTON: We need to do this, we need to do that. TRUMP: Blah blah blah Hillary, blah blah blah I'm rich. #debatenight
Too much smoke around small business owners saying Trump stiffed them for there to be no fire.  #debates #Debates2016 #debatenight
#We all know we need Law &amp; Order (great show).  How about no racisim, compassion, understanding, and respect? #debates #PresidentialDebate
Lets hear it for those 400-lb hackers doing it all from under their beds. Who'da thunk it? #fb #Debates2016
"I have a better temperament than her". Congrats, you broke the bullshit ticker. Jesus Christ.. #debatenight
Trump: "I fondly remember the B-52's. The rock lobster was a great military tactic" #debatenight
Okay because the common people travel to fucking Dubai and their biggest concern is airport conditions in the U. S. #debatenight
#Trump may be a low-energy loser but even #Hillary's voice makes my one year-old cry. #DebateNight
"I prepared to be President and that's a good thing" HRC. Trump is taking on water. #debatenight
He interrupts her and she can't finish her thoughts and then he gets to yammer on and on again. #debatenight
He says, "I was asked on a major show..."  I think, "Like Survivor? Real Housewives?"  This is not good.  #debatenight
I am getting no satisfaction from this at all. What an embarrassment. #Debates2016
"@jacobkornbluh: Trump is like God saying on Yom Kippur: 'You apologized for it, but you still did it.' #debates"Not like God. Jewish Moms!
#taxcut to the wealthy is going to put money… in their foreign accounts… not creating jobs mr. Trump. #debatenight
Trump demonstrating once and for all that "law and order" is the dog-whistle to end all dog-whistles. #debates
I'm not saying that in a super Cali fragilistic ex-braggadocious way - @realDonaldTrump #debatenight #Debates2016
FOR THE LOVE OF ALL THAT IS HOLY GET THIS MAN A TISSUE #debatenight
@BloombergTV Will you check on @LesterHoltNBC for me. i'm starting to get worried #debatenight
I just found out there's no rap battle portion of the debates and now I'm beginning to think @HamiltonMusical is a lie.
Many attacks against Trump. All justified and need to be talked about but the emails and Benghazi hasn't even been brought up  #debatenight
Well done, @HillaryClinton You clearly have been preparing to be our next President! #debatenight #debate
Ok, I had to hit mute. He makes me murderous with his useless crap. #debatenight
"You shouldn't have a profit motivation to fill prison cells with young Americans" is the most powerful line of #debatenight so far
someone count how much the candidates are using variations on "I" "me" "mine" v "we" "us" "ours"??? #Debates2016 #debatenight #debates
What's going on inside their heads:  Trump - don't say anything stupid Hillary - don't have a seizure   Hillary's winning #debatenight
Twitter observation: If you support #Trump, he's winning. If you support #Hillary she's winning. No minds/votes change tonight. #debatenight
Trump: we should have robbed a war torn country of its expensive natural resources. WOW #Debates
Trump trying to rewrite his history right now 😂😂😂 You fucking mess #Debates
We need to move on Donald. I am loving Lester Holt right now.  #debatenight
Man provoked by tweets never should run nation!HRC strong confident substantive. Presidential.Don not. Holt,should cut him off #debatenight
He's perfectly enunciating the concerns and thoughts of his followers. He is dominating this. he's destroying her. #Debates2016
"We should have taken the oil." Like all of it? Out of the ground? #debatenight
Trump: "Stop and frisk worked very well in New York." ~ I think some people might have a different view on that. #debatenight
Hillary feels the need to "one-up" Trump and that is going to make her look petty and like a harpy. #debatenight
Hillary thinks she's doing better than she actually is... Her grasp of reality is very distorted. #debatenight
ISIS IS HACKING THE INTERWEBS! WE'RE GOING TO BUILD A GREAT CHINESE FIREWALL AND MAKE MEXICO PAY FOR IT. -- Trump #infosec #debatenight
HRC clearly thinks she has something with the gun issue. Tim Kaine was in Orlando visiting Pulse today. #debatenight
Did he just say that immigrants cause high crime rates? Wut #debatenight
Both of them have had really racist statements in the past so I don't think either one can accuse the other of racism #debatenight
oh I see...so if you say that you did a great job enough times it becomes true #debatenight
Did anyone bother telling Trump how debates work? You can't talk during the 2 minutes brah. #PresidentialDebate
Stop and frisk? Yea, sounds like the perfect way to work on racial tensions @realDonaldTrump #idiot  #debates #debatenight
@realDonaldTrump is so far out his depth. It's like watching a toddler attempt Shakespeare. #debatenight
#Debates2016 Think of this as a magic show where #Drumpf is the distracting show girl while #QueenShrill does the real trick.
Hilary has the patience of a special education teacher (who are AMAZING).  Good for her. This alone speaks volumes. #Debates
Trump has, maybe, a 50 word vocabulary. I'm embarrassed even watching this. Clinton just assumes she'll win. Also embarrassing. #Debates
Clinton: "I think cybersecurity will be one of the biggest challenges facing the next president." #debates #debates2016
We need to stop violence. How ya gonna do it? We need to be strong. How will we be strong? I WANT DETAILS @realDonaldTrump #debatenight
Stop using empty buzz words and make a damn point trump #debatenight
Did he just respond to tax evasion allegations by saying "it would be squandered too?"  #debatenight #wtf
.@HFA: "Yes, I prepared for this #Debates2016. You know what else I prepared for? BEING PRESIDENT." #ImWithHer #StrongerTogether @ObamaDems
Can they take a commercial break so Trump can take a bump?! He's losing it and his sniffling is crazy #Debates2016
Donald just admitted he's a cheapskate in his campaign by not running ads against Hillary. #debatenight
@realDonaldTrump repeats himself on IRAQ because @HillaryClinton and other liberals will go on with their lies otherwise. #debatenight
Can you comment about the #PresidentialDebate if you don't have papers? Im asking for a friend😂😂😂 #debatenight
Planned to drink wine tonight. Didn't plan on feeling the need to drink straight from the bottle. #debatenight #PresidentialDebate #wine
WRONG?  Huh?  Does Trump have a double who's saying this stuff???!!!  #debatenight
Did Trump just say his use of tax loopholes "makes me smart"? Way to talk like a corrupt millionaire &amp; not a potential prez #debatenight
Hilary is literally just telling us facts we already know... What are you going to do about it???? "Um" isn't an answer..... #debatenight
hillary the hypocrite. it wasn't trump who threw a vase at bill clinton! i wouldn't talk ''temperment'' woman! #debatenight
Tbh can we just get an octopus to decide the election @MontereyAq ? #debatenight
Trump: I will release tax returns against lawyer's wishes when she releases the 33,000 emails #debatenight #debates2016
Boy, I see why she is so unlikable now. She is glowing with eliteness. #debates
Favorite new word...bragadocious. Trump doesn't want to be it but won't stop bragging about his business #debatenight
I made a mistake using a private email and if I had to do it over again, I'd do it differently - #Clinton #debatenight
Debates are annoying. I'm sitting here trying to fact check nearly every damn thing that comes out of both of these fools' mouths.
#debatenight Hilary talking about black folks arrested but she signed legislation to put us there!!!! Ok liar liar. Fake activism on fire.
#debatenight love how Hilary didn't answer the the "Super Predator" call out lol gotcha heffa.
#debatenight Trump yo ass is acting holier than thou too so have a seat  💺
Let the bets begin: How much do you say #trump has paid @LesterHoltNBC to allow him to speak more than allowed? #debatenight
Not paying taxes make you smart? you mean i have been dumb all my adult life? #debates
Dang,  Trump didn't lower his crazy flag,  he is flying it high..  Holy crap! Dude is deranged.. #debates
Lester: "What about you saying Obama wasn't born here?" Trump: "I want to defeat ISIS!" #Debates
"Why did she delete 30,000 emails?" Why did you delete your Chinese global warming tweet? #debatenight
Oh God. "Someone sitting on their bed that weighs 400 lbs." What the shit is going on here?! America, WHAT HAVE YOU DONE. #Debates
"We need to move on" - Moderator, just tired of this shit #debatenight #Debates2016
*flipping back and forth between "The Purge" and Donald Trump debating* "....huh..." #Debates2016
@LesterHoltNBC is going to punch the shit out of his steering wheel when he gets in his car tonight.  #Debates
"You was totally out of control" - Trump.  Nice English 😂😂😂. #ImWithHer #Debates2016
Oh please,  yes. Let’s let these two absolute EXPERTS in cyber-anything talk about this issue. #debatenight
Trump unapologetically owning not paying taxes: "That makes me smart" and "it would have been squandered." #debatenight
Do Hillary's people think that creepy frozen smile makes her look more human? #debatenight
"I got sued, but settled with no admission of guilt."  *Paid enough of dad's money to skirt repercussions*  #debates
Clinton - "He paid zero income tax" Trump - "Yeah, that makes me smart" 😂😂😂😂 brazen #debatenight
You know who needs to figure it out? The sound guy in the forum. #FeedbackCity #debatenight
Trump wants US out of NATO so his Russian buddies can take over Europe #comradetrump #hillary2016 #debates #HillaryN2016n20
Trump you are a complete Moron you don't know anything you don't make sense #debatenight
"I settled that lawsuit with no admission of guilt." Drumpf. THAT is his argument? He got away with racism when indicted?   #debatenight
So ....we are just gonna invade a country and rob them ?!??!?!? &amp; we wonder why other countries &amp; people hates the US.....DUDE #debatenight
Trump isn't even using proper grammar or sentence structure, and he wants to be president? #debatenight
Donald: *wasnt paying taxes*  "that makes me smart"  No. That makes you a fucking criminal. #Debates2016
OMG. Somebody better get him some smelling salts. I'm actually concerned for his health. #debatenight #debates
I love how @realDonaldTrump bragged about his "temperment" &amp; then @HillaryClinton &amp; the whole room laughed. #LOL #debatenight #fb
Tonight on Dateline, a moderator disappears. Two candidates left alone. And a Long Island neighborhood left confused. #debatenight
"I could give you a list of some very fine banks." Trump or Siri? #debatenight
@TomiLahren Don't listen to them Tomi you're super hot. But Hillary is crushing it right now #debatenight
Does Trump even know how actual debates work? He's like the kid who didn't do his homework.
#Trump is right about the Fed they're leaving a big bad mess for the next Potus #debatenight
My god..  this #debatenight is just a total shitshow. I feel bad for @LesterHoltNBC trying to corral these two #Debates2016
Hiding, Hillary what ARE YOU HIDING IN THOSE EMAILS    #debatenight
Did he just say he doesn't run nasty commercials against her?!?! #Debates2016
After this debate I am going to eat a pint of ice cream and look at paintings of Jesus #debatenight
Apparently @realDonaldTrump was the one to get @POTUS to produce a BC but didn't believe it was real until 4 years after??? #debatenight
BREAKING: over the last "little while" @realDonaldTrump has done an excellent job with race relations #nevertrump #debatenight
Among the many things Trump has not read, we're going to have to include "debate rules." #debatenight
The way Trump uses the word "beautiful" makes me think he doesn't know what it means...  #debatenight
Trump keeps yelling "wrong" in the mic at any time. Absolutely disrespectful. #debatenight
This is out of control. No way Donald trump can be president ole boy would start ww3 at the inauguration  #debatenight
I want friends who tell me $650 million isn't a lot of money 😩 #Debates2016
The race relations discussion has been the most telling thus far. Large divide in competence between the two candidates #debatenight
20:1 odds @realDonaldTrump comments on the pillow Hillary is sitting on before the debate ends #debatenight
So he's audited every year, has been audited for 15 years, and will release his taxes when the audit is over. #debatenight
This debate is so exciting. Oh my gosh. Where's the popcorn? Wow. What entertainment #Debates2016 #DebateNight
Fighting ISIS her entire life? When did ISIS come into existence? Someone please wake me up😱😱😱😱😱 #debatenight
"We need to restore trust. Everyone should be respected by the law and should respect the law." - @HillaryClinton #Debates2016 @KTLA
"ARE YOU PEOPLE HEARING WHAT I'M HEARING? WHY ARE WE HERE" -@HillaryClinton #debatenight
"I know how to win!" he sounds like one of my first graders #debatenight #ImWithHer
@realDonaldTrump you are a moron, and a walking catastrophe. Just apologize, go home, and think about what you did. #debatenight
Hang in there @HillaryClinton. Fight the bully for all of us. Positive vibes from our Haiti-based debate watching party. #DebateNight
.@realDonaldTrump not sure it was Russia that cyberhacked DNC . Have to get tough on cyber security #Debates2016 @LIBN
SHE JUST CALLED HIM A RACIST AND A LIAR! SHE DID IT AGAIN!!! #DebateNight
There is to legal or otherwise way to appeal your placement on the terrorist watchlist, Mr. Trump. #NYDebate #debatenight
Nuclear a bigger threat than climate only for the short time #Trump as #Potus. Cause he'd hit the button and then all gone #debates
Just call him racist. Just say it. "You are being racist." #debatenight
What strikes me the most is how polite and graceful HRC is while Trump is sarcastic, snarky, and arrogant. #Debates #DebateNight
I would feel better if the choice was Secretary Elizabeth McCord. #Debates2016
Trump did you hear how to reference a material? " When they go low, we go high"- Michelle!  Please remind your pretty wife..#Debates2016
Everybody at home right now thinks they know what a bubble because of "The Big Short" #Debates2016
Do they get a halftime to regroup? Yes? Somebody better slip Trump a Xanax or two, he's really a tad overexcited. #debatenight
Why is this lunatic @realDonaldTrump so respectful tonight..damn he might be winning this thing. @HillaryClinton is long winded #debatenight
People love Trump for not being politically correct but he doesn't "tell it like it is." He "tells it like he feels." #debates
"Let's talk about the question you asked, Lester." What a novel idea... #debatenight
Race!lord if Donald gets in office he would probably have a Purge from 12 -6am kill all the Mexicans and black people you can!  #Debates2016
Fast forward to Twitter later on: "Trump won, Hillary sucks!" "no, Hillary won, Trump sucks!" robble robble robble #debatenight
I don't care about race, I just want it to be known I got Obama birth certificate #Debates
Speak on it @HillaryClinton - Black &amp; Hispanic communities are strong, hard-working and PROUD. I am a product of it! #debatenight #debates
These are two of the LEAST transparent candidates arguing about who is the least transparent #debatenight
Laughing and crying... RT @etupper: You guys my stomach hurts so much from laughing #debatenight
"I have met a lot of people who were stiffed by your businesses, Donald," @HillaryClinton #debatenight
I want the moderator to have the ability to cut microphones and you should get play off music like on the Oscars. #debatenight
"What made you push this falsehood about Obama's birth certificate?"   Racism, that's what.  #debates
Am I in the point in life where I actually watch the presidential debates?
"My stoniest asset is my temperament," says the orange man as he turns red. #debatenight #MomsAgainstTrump
Every time they mention "trickle-down economics", all I think of is #FerrisBueller.  #Gottalaugh #debatenight
Oh, he can hide behind CPA's and his Lawyer 's but her people don't have the same rights? #Debates
Donald trump is a good crooked salesman don't buy into it. #debatenight
I've come to the conclusion that no matter who wins, the US is completely screwed for the next 4 years #debatenight
#CrookedHillary STILL WANTS TO TAKE ALL THE GUNS AWAY! ALL THE GUNS #debatenight #Debates2016
So basically he doesn't intend to fix the issue of Black Americans being unlawfully killed?#Debates
Somebody tell Hillary it okay to laugh. We all are at this point 😂#Debates2016 #debatenight
.@DrJillStein: "we need a new offensive in the Middle East--a #peace offensive--beginning with a weapons embargo" #debates #debatenight
Wtf!!! This man is nuts!!! #Debates2016 #debatenight always has some negative stuff to say 😑
Ask the innocent black people in Chicago is they would support stop and frisk, they get assaulted in their own front yards #debatenight
Yeah Muslims on the front lines all right, they're the ones attacking us..  #debatenight
"They talk good" they talk good!?! You are running for the president of the United States, not the 4th grade.#debatenight #englishmothafucka
Trump use of #cyber is as bad as #gwbush use of the #internets in 2004. #debatenight
I can see people not liking Trump but voting for Hillary is disgusting. She is a mess. #debatenight #debates
@jenniferbeals so I guess it's Obama's fault for shootings in Chicago. That's what Trump is trying to get people to believe.  #debatenight
How about free trade and keeping our military out of other countries? #DebateNight
Why won't anyone believe Comrade Hildog that TRUMPF has something DARK DARK SCARY to hide? STFU about the treason already OMG  #debatenight
donald trump really wants to call a friend (sean hannity) in this game of 'who wants to be millionaire' #debatenight or game show?
#debatenight Funny, I haven't met employees of Clinton, because she kills them all.
I legitimately believe that Trump can't finish a sentence without intersecting himself with a self-compliment. #debatenight
She talks about people having military weapons you have to have a military license order to get some of these guns #Debates
It's a good thing my doctors won't let me eat or drink anything because I would already be through a bottle of Makers #IVlife #Debates2016
#debates Attn black America. Trump just spoke of all his police support. He's incapable of addressing the problem factually. #ImWithHer
"I just want everyone to know that my son, he's 10, loves computers!" –Trump #DEBATENIGHT
So racial profiling is ok because black people and Hispanics are criminals? This is disgusting. #debatenight
That's such a stupid thing to say. S hell do dah man here #debatenight
@juliemason to be fair HRC is not lose but i cant blame her DT is all over the map?#debatenight
There's too many regulations....I take advantage of those regulations to not pay people. #debatenight
"I have better temperament" Trump is crazy. Seriously. I think he has mental instabilities. #debatenight
#debatenight HRC giving ANSWERS to policy isues not just shouting her mislead opinion like DT #ImWithHer
Can someone please translate? I can't follow anything he is saying.  #Debates
Obama is now responsible for murders in Chicago??? Blame the black guy, huh?#Debates
#Trump is up here talking about building and better airports real estate and property  but we have severe global warming.smh #gtfoh #debates
"I have developed very good relationships over the last... Little while with the African American community." Shut up trump. #DebateNight
I don't think Trump understands what "facts" are. Or the economy. Or leadership. #debatenight
When does @LesterHoltNBC give these 2 socks full of horse manure?  #debatenight #Debates2016
@axetothemax ... she looks like she's in need of a stiff espresso. #ouch #debatenight
#debatenight kindergarten style. What a steaming pile of horse shit. Only in America.
*Debates raging*  So I just got an amazing deal on art X3
Hillary plans to invest in clean/solar energy and create jobs... While destroying all the coal/oil jobs. #debatenight
I really don't want to hear what Trump has to say about race.. #debatenight
Trump talks a lot about his friends, but has anybody actually seen any of them? I think he owes them all money #debatenight
He just talkin bout gettin the rich more richer, he dont even support the lower n middle class,  #FDT #Debates
"Very bad things."  What am I supposed to be afraid of, #Donald? #debatenight #Debates2016
When @realDonaldTrump says "Law and Order" I'm pretty sure he's talking about the show #debatenight
Holt has to be meditating. Because if it was me, I'd turn that debate around and send them to bed. #debatenight
The most fucked up thing about this election by far is that Hillary's wearing red and Trump's wearing a blue tie #Debates2016 #Election2016
"Bigly" he is side stepping the question because we need Law and Order" #debatenight
Trump has a better temperament than Clinton. LOL Does he watch himself? #Debates2016
@realDonaldTrump says @ICEgov endorsed him. The ICE officers union did, not quite the same. #DebateNight
I've paid more in Federal Taxes than Donald J. Trump, AMA plz donate to my kickstarter #debatenight
Many many people are saying that Trump has nose cancer. Something is very very wrong with his nose. He is too sick #DebateNight
Trump snorted a few lines of K before he came out on stage. Explains the sniffling and droopy eyes #debatenight #debates  #StrongerTogether
. @realDonaldTrump said @HillaryClinton has been "fighting ISIS her whole life." Roots of ISIS only in early 2000s. #Debates2016 #factcheck
Of course Trump would say that the wealthy create jobs and deserve tax breaks. #debates
I'm not watching the debates at all but all these live tweets makes me absolutely not excited about this election
Oh yeah, Trump should criticize someone ELSE for playing too much golf. Are you F'ING kidding me???? #debatenight
Trump won't shut the fuck up when it's not his turn. I want to slap him! #DebateNight
@realDonaldTrump keeps lying about U.S. troop withdrawals in Iraq that were mandated by President George W. Bush. #debatenight
Well I hate to say it but either way our next president is gonna have a small pouty mouth #debates
Why haven't the rich started making jobs and expanding businesses to jumpstart our economy? #AskDonald #debatenight
It's a #Mullet vs a #Combover and we know one is just SAD and the other is #Business in the front-Party in the back. #VoteMullet #debates
"That's not a lot of money." Of course it's not Donald. I mean gee golly your father gave you ONLY $1 million to spare. #debatenight
Blaming Obama for the faulty actions of individual officers is like blaming God for all the negative events in our lives. #debatenight
Note how Trump never directly answers a question. He makes false accusations to manipulate the audience. Do NOT vote for him. #debatenight
Trump just said that he didn't pay the contractor for his golf club, because he was unhappy with his work. #DebateNight
I will never understand why working class people think giving tax breaks for the rich actually help them. #trickledownmyass #debates
He's saying absolutely nothing. Because he has absolutely nothing to say. About race. #debates
Donald Trump is not debating. He's throwing a tantrum. He is repeating himself because he has NOTHING of value to contribute. #debates
Pro #Trump ppl: are any of you not racist? HAVE U BEEN TO A 3rd WORLD COUNTRY? THEY DON'T HAVE WIFI &amp; RUNNING WATER EVERYWHERE #Debates2016
#Debates Trump can't help himself, he's trying to sell his brand &amp; bragging abt his business in a presidential #debates2016 R U kidding me?
#Debates Wrong DJT &gt;There you go again declaring Stop &amp; Frisk is sound!&amp; all African American communities R poor, wretched so need law order
I never talk about politics,but if this shit isn't obvious to you,you've done the impossible &amp; literally rendered me speechless #debatenight
He developed great relationships over the "past little while" with the African American community. You're fking 70. #debatenight
Wow..way to even manage body shaming into your debate answer. Zero facts, zero plans, zero knowledge, zero IQ = ZERO RESPECT. #debatenight
"I think there are a number of issues." is like the "gimme a sec to think" of this #debatenight
Um, I am at a point where I'm legitimately offended with all the shit Trump is talking about my country. #debatenight
Trump just said he had a better temperment and everyone laughed at him like me in middle school saying I wasn't fat. #debatenight
"I'm trying to save the money. Because I don't have any and I need it to settle lawsuits." #debatenight
Trump cheated on his wife remember that, it tells a lot about his personality #ImWithHer #debatenight #Debates
Hey @HillaryClinton why not just ban people from coming into America until we figure this mess out?  #Debates
"Donald Trump, it's your turn" DJT: "I have endorsements from 100s of people you never heard of and aren't relevant to this Q" #debatenight
Clinton on Trump's temperament: A man who can be provoked by a tweet should not have the nuclear launch codes #debatenight #USvote
Trump "I've been audited for 15 years straight" what kind of shitty business have you been into? #debatenight #trump #Clinton
Trump just admit it! We're going to war with ISIS if you become president! #debatenight
he is a bully,he is not letting her talk &amp; why he is drinking so much water,is he nervous? unrespectful #debatenight #Debates2016 #FoxNews
#Hillary has the nerve to talk about hiding info Who deletes emails   #debatenight
we need more police ?? so that they can shoot more unarmed black men ?? #Debates2016
Hillary funny lol she just patiently waiting for him to stfu #debatenight
Can someone bring the sniffling candidate a box of tissue please!!???  #DebateNight
For a non-politician, Trump sure is avoiding this question as well as any other politician. #Debates2016 #debates
@realDonaldTrump  got that   " I WISH THIS BITCH WOULD " FACE ON  #debatenight #debate
Yes, Obama should have produced his BIRTH CERTIFICATE when you won't produce your tax returns. #debatenight
Nobody CARES. Let's get to the issues. Tax returns mean nothing. #debates #Debates2016 #debatenight #MAGA
This debate is an aborting of justice. WTF, HOLT. Total hack. Clinton not asked about foundation. #debates #Debates2016 #debatenight #MAGA
Trump is holding his own at the debate. Not letting Holt rick roll him. #debates #Debates2016 #debatenight #MAGA
Someone please overlay the SVU theme song ("dun dun") after Donald Trump saying "we need law and order" #debatenight
Trump: you have the right to your gun, but if you are black you don't have the right to move about freely. Sick! #debates
OH! So THATS how you know the infer city blacks had it bad off. #Debates2016
HE ADMITTED THAT HE HASN'T PAID FEDERAL TAXES BECAUSE "That makes me smart" WHAT?!??!! #Trump #debatenight
"I think implicit bias is a problem for everyone, not just police." - @HillaryClinton #debatenight
I have watched Hillary her entire career and you are seeing her do what she does best on #debatenight lies and propaganda. #NeverHillary
Why can't the #FLOTUS just run for president? I would totally vote for her ❤️👍🏼 #debatenight #debates #FLOTUS4president2016
Lester Holt calls out DT's "Stop &amp; Frisk" promotion with facts on discrimination, DT still maintains his stance #debatenight
"MAYBE BECAUSE YOU HAVEN'T PAID TAXES".....thats gonna hurt in the morning @realDonaldTrump #Debates2016 #debatenight
Fuck you Trump, stop talking, you don't even know what email is. Much less a server. Much less why we're pissed about it. #debatenight
But Trump how can you be strong with SUCH SMALL HANDS!? #debatenight
"The record shows that I am RIGHT. Because FUCK HISTORY!?!?!!" -Trump #debatenight
#debatenight Donald's drawback: Not listening at all. Hilary's drawback: listening too much.  Donald. Shut up.  Hilary. Don't.
At this point we'll be receiving 1 of 2:   H: "Pandering with no procedure"   T: "Prejudice with no policy"   #Debates2016 #debatenight
IF WE COULDNT BUY GUNS SO EASILY WE WOULDNT HAVE TO HAVE THEM TO DEFENS OURSELVES #debatenight
Wow!! Trump knows so many city's... like Chicago, and New York and Chicago and Dallas, oh and like Chicago... #debatenight
Iraq invasion was a bad idea but it's ironic for Guy who skipped military service ask for leaving 10k troops in Iraq  #debates #debatenight
All I have to say is... I feel sorry for Lester Holt. This evening's ringmaster has lost control of this circus. #campaign2016 #debates
Has Donald Trump even read a single newspaper since 1989? Third World Country? Really? #debatenight
Hillary takes notes when trump talks and trump just interrupts when Hillary talks. #Debates
Trump doesn't know about the Status of Forces Agreement problems?  And you can't take the oil! Geneva Convention! #debatenight
My impression of Hillary Clinton so far tonight is of an annoyed parent waiting for a child to finish their temper tantrum #debatenight
"The @NRA are very good people" is the biggest lie of the night. #debatenight #debates
HRC should get @realDonaldTrump to commit to a CR funding Flint $. #Debates2016 Would tie his hands and prove she gets shit done.
Trump: my son is 10 years old and he is very good in computer. 😂😂😂 #Debates2016 #debate
The fact that HRC is keeping cool against the ravings of this buffoon is proof enough that she should be President. #Debates2016 #ImWithHer
I feel like I'm waiting for Charlie Murphy to start narrating every time #Trump speaks. #debates #ChappellesShow
It's so interesting to hear a racist talking about how he's not a racist.#DebateNight #Trump #HillaryClinton
Trump wants a wall - but thank god for the tunnels #snort #Debates2016 #debatenight - reality show does not make a president - dick!
Trump in 5 seconds. Obamas birth certificate. Fight Isis. Build a wall. NOTHING MAKES SENSE! #debate2016 #debatenight
I think the real issue tonight is that nobody has @seanhannity 's phone number. #Debates2016
@realDonaldTrump You said "my African american." Get a grip,  dude.  #debatenight
So far it's a draw!   Neither giving realistic plans #Debates2016
He doesn't even make sense.  Is there any actual policy?  #debates
#debatenight she is looking tired. no coughing. wonder what she took to prevent that.
Training isn't going to fix this.They would have needed training if white men were dying at the same rate.. better psych eval? #Debates2016
Trump is snorting back snot far too much for a man who has never done drugs. #debatenight
Trump, you are not in charge of this debate. Let Lester do his job. #heneedsasquirtbottle #baddog #debatenight
WHY should he have produced his birth certificate?!?! You're insane. Maybe he only should have if you released your taxes #debates
Just b/c you settle with no fault doesnt mean you didnt do it #debatenight racism just one of those things...
He hasnt given a thought to NATO they are our biggest allies. #notprepared #debatenight
You can't bargain your tax returns with emails. THEY ARE NOT EQUIVALENT #Debates
Don def has the temperament that would start a war over literally anything that offended him. #Debates
#debates "Wrong" by Trump should be a GIF now, so we all can use it daily !!
Wow! His face just turned beet red  when asked about his taxes!  #DebateNight
Trump: My strongest attribute is my temperament.   Clinton:  BWAHAHAHAHA! #debates
The nominee for PRESIDENT has brought up the issues of how ugly our airports are. #debatenight
What is this mans obsession with Mexico 󾌡󾆳󾆳󾆳?!? Leave them alone lol!! — watching Presidential Debates 2016
Oh snaps, #DebateNight Trump is finally jabbing back. Brought up the "Super predator" quote. Let's see how Clinton responds
@PatriciaHeaton It's a total joke, and not a funny one. It's a cruel "you're screwed either way" joke! #GodHelpUs #debatenight
"It's all words, it's all sound bites...so let me give you a few and you use only the good ones, got it?" #debatenight
"It could be Russia or China or someone sitting on his bed that weighs 400 lbs." @DebateNight
How old does a B52 have to be for my grandfather to be able to fly it?  #DebateNight
The nightly news said the presidential debates are of a higher caliber than the primary debates... More composed, serious, etc. 😐 #debates
Made it home in time to watch #debatenight. Shoutout to all the places live-streaming #debate2016 for free so folks can be informed.
I hope someone is counting the # of times @realDonaldTrump says "I" compared to @HillaryClinton #debatenight
Can someone tell @realDonaldTrump that there is no need for him to yell for us to hear whatever he has to vomit ?  #debatenight
#debatenight So #Hillary assumes that #trump probably didn't pay any income taxe and the only answer he has is "that makes me smart" #idiot
#Debates2016 @realDonaldTrump's tie is on his lapel. Blue tie against @HillaryClinton's red attire. Color swap?
Are we sure that glass Trump was sipping only contained water? #maddow #debateNight
The hardest part of debating Donald Trump is: where do you even fucking start? #maddow #debateNight
HRC: "A man who can be provoked by a tweet should not have his fingers anywhere near the nuclear codes." #maddow #debateNight
"Maybe he did a bad job?" That's not a legitimate answer. #debatenight
Which version of Law and Order do we need? SVU is my fave #debates
She has to cooperate with Muslim nations. They're her biggest donors  #debatenight
I can't stand when Trump says "African American." I don't perceive it as positive. It SOUNDS like the n-word to me. #Debates
take a shot every time Trump goes off topic from the questions  #debatenight
Nobody likes the guy who speaks about himself in third person 😂 #Debatenight #Debates
Do people actually think he'll do a good job as president? I want what they're  smoking. #Debates #PresidentialDebate
Hillary: Trump: The emails!!!!!!! The emails! Release the emails or else!!!! #debatenight
I"m so proud of her. When he shouts over her, she doesn't raise her voice. Let the rage monster rage himself out. #debatenight #ImWithHer
Anyone else notice that Trump never lets even Lester finish his sentence before he starts ranting? #debatenight
Political hacks? How about you telling Russia to hack the US?!?! #debatenight
TRUMP JUST SAID HE WAS SMART FOR NOT PAYING FED TAXES FUCK THIS GUY #Debates2016
I wonder what music he's listening to it keeps bobbing his head back and forth #debatenight
Yo Hillary is making this look easy... or is #Druph doing that for her.. #comical #debatenight
"You look at the Middle East, it's a total mess."   Please don't elect this man President. #debates
Don't let #DebateNight distract you from what's really important...  The Warriors blew a 3-1 lead.
DNC was hacked, it shouldn't matter because your emails were there for the taking...#debatenight #debates @HillaryClinton @realDonaldTrump
I can't with these people. I don't even wanna know what my blood pressure is right now. #Debates2016
My 10 yr old: His temperament is his strongest asset? Those are some really WEAK assets!! #trumpisntsmarterthanafifthgrader  #debates
This is more like it. Trump and Hillary #debatenight heating up over Iraq. @DeWetshofWines Finesse Chardonnay can now be opened.
Won't somebody think of poor Sean Hannity, nobody calls him #Debates2016 :/
Haha! She wants to talk about sense?! Does anyone really believe Iran has been disarmed? Let's not be that naïve, America. #Debates2016
TWITTER HAS NEVER BEEN SO ACTIVE I AM S H O O K #debatenight
How can anyone support this man? He literally makes no sense #DebateNight
"Just listen to what you heard" should literally be @HillaryClinton's pinned Tweet for this election #Debates
Trump is so dumb if he thinks we are in bad shape right now #DebateNight
@realDonaldTrump does not understand diplomacy! He is a capitalist! Win win! More shares or nothing happened! #factcheck2016 #Debates
I just wish someone would figure out how to have an equal ratio of shampoo and conditioner,can never run out at the same time. #debatenight
I wonder how many votes Harambe will be getting this year #DebateNight
"I think implicit bias is a problem for everyone. Not just police. I think too many of us..jump to conclusions" omfg love her. #debatenight
Donald Trump just said Immigrants have guns and are shooting people.  #Debates
Donald trump is calling blacks and hispanics victims of racism but just blamed immigrants for it?  #Debates
he not even intellegent or level headed enough to be president...like do you see him having debates and dealing w world issues &amp; leaders? no
I think @realDonaldTrump's getting beaten so hard in this debate hes taking it out on the water. He's finished like 16 glasses. #debatenight
#DebateNight| HRC: 'if you're too dangerous to fly, you're too dangerous to buy a gun ...'
#DebateNight| HRC: 'it has been the policy of the U.S to reduce the proliferation of nuclear weapons ... [U.S warheads 6970, Russia 7300]
Nato members not paying fair share. Hmmm. Like you not paying your taxes. #Debates
"Yes. I was sued for being racist, but so were other people." ... What? #debatenight #drunktweetthedebates
Blue tie for the Republican candidate? Was that a good call? #debatenight #equaltreatment
Someone sitting on their bed weighing 400 lbs? Did I just hear that? #debatenight #debates
"It's about time that this country had someone running it that had an idea about money"  - Trump  #DebateNight
Y'all act like you can read Donald Trump's tax return.   #debatenight
Drumpf admitted to not renting to Blacks.  And adds that that's perfectly fine, because other companies were doing the same.  #DebateNight
@HillaryClinton: Race determines too much. Education, schools and how they are treated in criminal justice system. #debatenight @CMLIFE
@realDonaldTrump: I'm taking guns away from gangs and violent people. "Stop and Frisk" impacted safety of NYC. #debatenight @CMLIFE
@realDonaldTrump on @NATO: They do not focus on terror. Need to pay their fair share. "We pay up 73% of cost to NATO." #debatenight
"Believe me" "Trust me" "Out of the ballpark". Trump. PLEASE, PLEASE speak to in FACTS. F- the audit. Show your tax returns #debatenight
He can't even finish a sentence when called out!As @J_J_Nicholson so eloquently said"You want the truth?You can't handle the truth!"#debates
What Trump just did - the sigh and the eye-roll - cost Gore the Presidency. #NobodyCares? #debatenight
DemocRats simply abandoned blacks, and Hispanics to cater to my people.  #Debates
No matter the outcome, we're all screwed. Welcome to the end, folks. #debatenight
I need to follow more Trump supporters I think. My feed is one sided. I want to learn how it's possible to support him. Curious. #debates
Kap takes a knee during the anthem, he's unpatriotic.  Corporations move money offshore to avoid, America is the bad guy. #debatenight
#Debates2016: Wait, so when exactly do most of us real Americans fly in from Dubai?
Trump, you got my vote. But please, PLEASE, stop repeating yourself and talking about your endorsements. #debatenight #Debates2016
#debates @LesterHoltNBC it's not your job to interject yourself into the debate.  This is 2 vs 1. You are cheating. You're a referee only.
Well, there's the trump we remember- trump just repeating random conversations he's heard vs Hilary repeating FACTS!! #debatenight
Hey @HillaryClinton? A woman who goes ballistic at the women your husband hits on should NEVER have the nuclear codes. #Debate2016 #debates
Donald has the "I have no idea what I'm doing" look #DebateNight
"Charlotte - a city I love. A city where I have investments."  #debatenight
honestly just wish President Obama could stay in the White House forever 😭 #debatenight
I do not think temperament means what you think it means #trump #debatenight #debate #debate2016
He nailed it: She DOES behave like she's holier than thou &amp;I better than everyone. Can't stand it! #Debates2016
@HillaryClinton is poised/professional. @realDonaldTrump is rambling like a drunken Frat boy or someone on amphetamines. #debatenight
Man, white Americans just cannot chat about race. Lord. Reminds me of Grade 9 History classes. Damn. #Debates2016
@realDonaldTrump Donald it's a debate you ding dong... you are not supposed to be nodding in agreement with your rival... #debatenight
ahh time to watch 70 year old rich white people talk about cybersecurity #debatenight
Are you releasing the returns or nah? Are you releasing the emails or nah? #Debates2016 #debatenight
Wait so now he's not going to release his tax returns #debates
You can go to the voting booth and get kicked in the groin or punched in the throat and it will be the same as voting. #debatenight
FACT Trump's claim he did not support the war on Iraq is FALSE. I hope i dont lie this much in my life #morals #debatenight #debates
You don't mind releasing your taxes, Donald? Then release them, like every other presidential candidate in my lifetime. #Debates2016
Our police are afraid to do anything? Tell that to the bodies. #debatenight
I just screamed "she knows everything and you doN'T KNOW ANYTHING!!!!" at my TV and burst into tears. #champagne #Debates2016
#debatenight #debates #Debates2016 @HillaryClinton HOW  HOW ABOUT AN APOLOGY FOR  CHRIS STEVENS  TY WOODS  GLEN DOHERTY  SEAN SMITH
#debatenight #debates #Debates2016  @HillaryClinton s husband was the driving force behind privatization of prisons
I hate it when rich slick white men over 50 grunt when I am talking. #bully #debatenight
Clinton: we need thoughtful analysis and potential reform. Trump: we need law and order. Period. Unbelievable. #debatenight
Destroyed on not paying any tax like the rest of us. Deservedly. #debatenight
"Let's start the clock again, Lester." YOU TELL EM HILLARY 🐋 #debatenight
How can anyone be extremely underleveraged? Perhaps he's loaning out money instead of borrowing? #debates
I just knew he will drag this matter to the email question.  The crowd even cheering. #debatenight
Yeah guys, we need Law &amp; Order. It's a great show. #debates
In Clinton's head, WG Snuffy Walden's music is building, and the birther response is her Jed Bartlet moment #debatenight
Hillary Clinton just said "make all the gains".   That is all.   #debatenight
This is basically like the taxi cab argument of my worst nightmares. #debatenight
She's keeping it cool &amp; confident. He looks like he's gonna have a temper tantrum. Noodle body if anyone tries 2 pick him up. #Debates2016
Can ICE - a federal agency - endorse a candidate, Donald? #Debates2016
If someone skinned us all, we would all look the same, race is merely skin deep #debates #Debates2016 #debatenight
Praying to everything holy this ends with him taking a long pause and going "...fuck it, vote for her." #Debates2016
I do not think Trump understand "common sense gun control." He has no common sense.   #debatenight
Trump's deep sniffing is a tell... get ready for the big story....  #debatenight
I like how Trump blames large issue decisions solely on Hilliary #Debates2016
BTW debate is oratory. Don't talk to me about Hillary's speaking skills again. #debatenight
That Pennsylvania Avenue aside was the saddest thing he's ever said? #debatenight
So what if Trump was endorsed by ICE when Obama chose who is the director #DebateNight
Hillary Clinton just called everyone in the country racist. "We all have implicit bias." Wow! #debatenight
When we talk gun violence, we need to stop gun violence by police against black people #debatenight #debates #blacklivesmatter
Politicans need to stop scapegoating people with mental illness; that is not the answer to gun violence #disarmhate #debatenight #debates
Twitter about the debates is much more entertaining, than the debates.
Trump seems to judge the entire US Black population by Chicago's crime rate #debates
Trumps says audit is reason he has not released tax forms. Holt reminds that IRS has stated it should not be a problem. #debatenight
Trump: "That was more than a mistake" - talking about Clinton email issue #debates
Clinton: "Everyone should be respected by the law and everyone should respect the law." #debates #debatenight
Trump: "I did a great service to the country in getting him to produce his birth certificate." #debates
Quit lying about what everybody has already researched! We can learn what we want to learn from your taxes. #Debates2016
@realDonaldTrump sounds like he's out of breath. You talked all that shit about @HillaryClinton health. Maybe slow down a bit. #debatenight
If we made a wordle of what Trump has said so far, the biggest words would be "BELIEVE me." #debatenight
Funny thing about @realDonaldTrump is that he re-writes his own history according to what sound right st that time - LIAR #debatenight
Can we ask Trump if he's feeling ok like we HAD to do with Hillary? Im sick of the sniffles. Get the cowbell, he has a fever. #Debates2016
Trump giving me a damn headache rambling on about nothing stfu already  #DebateNight
Wait so Trump is going to cut taxes and rebuild our infrastructure and reduce our deficit?  #Debates
Hillary Clinton must have been a great mom because she's really good at arguing with this 5 year old #Debates
@chrislhayes #debatenight so the Trump people made big deal about hillary's cough, what about how much water trump is drinking. Nervous much
I wonder of Donald Trump has to pee he's drinking a lot of water #Debate2016 #debatenight
Hillary Clinton talking about cyber security........   ....that's it. That's the joke. #debatenight
If #LesterHolt ask about his interest in birth cert he BETTER ask Clinton about deleting 33,000 emails. #debatenight is RIGGED!!
So this moderator is just going to let him speak forever... okay #Debates2016
Trump wanted to yell "FAG!" SO BADLY when Hillary said her father was a drapery installer. #debatenight
What does the birth certificate have to do with fighting ISIS? @realDonaldTrump tf you be on? #Debates2016
Impressive to see a grown man using school yard insults.  #debatenight
Hillary's dangerous—lets put HER on the no-fly list.   Grounding her would curb global warming, too.  #DebateNight
#Trump is drawing dicks on a notepad while #Hillary speaks. I guarantee it. #debates
This debate should never happen! Donald isn't qualified to be in this position. #Debates
How many questions can he deflect?   Mumbling, hissing... Stumbling. #debatenight
Serious question, would legalizing marijuana cut down on AA's crime rate and stifle future arrests? Would it improve race relations #Debates
😣 everyone talks about mental health but AFTER the election mental health programs get cut ASAP #debatenight
#Debates2016 I do not want to hear @realDonaldTrump anymore! His voice hurts my ears!
"I've been all over the place. You decided to stay home." *inserts Skye face cap* #debatenight
Trump is yelling at her. She's just letting him do it. #debatenight #Debates2016
From watching #debates , i'm interesting what is Live feature mechanism, especially performance and availabilty.
Nothing like date night... and by date night I mean long distance watching the #debatenight together via text.
Can't imagine that @realDonaldTrump will be able to talk about race issues in America with anything resembling tact. Let's see #debatenight
A fun story about @realDonaldTrump and his dear friend @seanhannity - why won't anyone call him?! Just dial him up Lester #debatenight
Take a shot every time Trump says "wall" Take a shot every time Hillary coughs Have 911 on speed dial #debates
The National Guard will keep us safe from ISIS. Not crooked politicians. #debatenight
When's Holt gonna do his Candy Crowley impression and make a false correction? #debatenight
Trump supporters can't blame Obama for dividing the country when they're calling him the N word at the same time  #debatenight
Just stop. Jesus, it went to a judge who was against the police my ass. It was unconstitutional and promoted racial profiling #debatenight
Omfg did he really say he did not support the war in Iraq. #debatenight
Ask not what you can do for your country, ask how you can exploit bankruptcy provisions to avoid paying contractors. #Debates2016
Trump did not interrupt this much even through the primary debates. This is ludicrous- the sexism is blatant +The pettiness of these topics
Hillary, who compromised national security with her private email servers, is talking about cyber security. Peak 2016. #debatenight
Our airports are from a 3rd world country??? They have sushi, spas &amp; gucci stores at 3rd world airports??? #PresidentialDebate #debatenight
Instead of hearing him yell garbage, @realDonaldTrump supporters are going to be proud of him for "standing up to her" #debatenight
Trump: Stop and Frisk over Stop and Give Educational and Work Opportunities. #Debates2016 #DonaldRump
I don't know who's the biggest liar of all time. Trump, Hillary or Manti Te'o? #debatenight
@realDonaldTrump certainly has some experience in running indebted entities...so he's right about that. #debatenight
#debatenight  "Relationships are a beautiful thing."   So directly answering the questions.
I'm foaming at the mouth waiting for @billmaher @RealTimers once the #Debates2016 are done!! In Bill We Trust!
I wonder if the big Cheeto has a cold or is the BS he's trying to sell has clogged his nose... Someone get him a Kleenex. #debatenight
When trump gonna tombstone piledriver Hillary through the Spanish announce table #DebateNight
Odd Trump never mentioned Blumenthal one time when bringing up #birtherism for several years...#DonTheCon #Debates2016 #debatenight
Trump should have to release his taxes. That is a big issue that he is trying to avoid tonight!  #ImWithHer #Debates2016
What in the blue state of moon country is he talking about #debatenight
It's those 400lbers on their beds you have to watch out for, eh Donald? #debatenight
Did Trump just says he's building something right next to the White House? #Debates2016
Hillary: maybe he's not as rich as he says he is. Trump automatically adjusts himself. #debates
Hillary: 25 years of "very good relations" but there were "some consequence" and also sentencing disparities #debates
Trump: I have been listening to Gingrich on all my style points. #debates
Trump is correct about politicians only talking about African American issues once every four years. #debatenight
HRC camp busted for systematically overcharging their smallest donors #Debates2016  look it up on duck duck go #debatenight #debates
The Chicago statistics in Obama era gun violence are overpowered #Debates2016 watching this on CSPAN, cant handle big box media gaslighting
I believe this question is actually: “Have you ever heard of the “first use" policy and do you know what it is?” #debatenight
he keeps repeating all the thousands of people getting shot but he refuses to increase gun control i don't understand #debatenight #debates
Important #debatenight ??:  1) how many Americans are watching? 2) &amp; of those, how many are drinking to survive this? #PresidentialDebate
It's a debate night first. The man is wearing more hairspray than the woman. Oh, and a woman is on stage! #debatenight
Sit tight Hills, let Lester get under is very thin skin. #debatenight
"Our airports are something from a third world country" is something only a rich person would say. #Debates2016
Watching #debatenight? Go to my website instead. We don't share our ISIS-fighting secrets.
@realDonaldTrump is talking like that paper you wrote that says the same thing over and over again,hoping to still get a good grade #Debates
First it was that he couldn't release them because of the audit, now it's "I'll release them when she releases her emails" 🙄 #Debates2016
He tried to bring up "super predator" as if he hasn't said a whole ton of racist shit #Debates2016
Yes Donald, we know about the shootings in other places, but how are you going to HEAL THE RACIAL DIVIDE??  #debatenight
Did he really just say he was smart because he has never paid taxes?  How is that ok? #Debates2016
Quote of the night was in my living room "People are running from the president so they have to debate." -my three year old #Debates2016
I get that politicians are dirty, but what about the businessmen, like Mr Trump, influencing and paying off politicians? #debatenight
I am currently watching two children yell at each other on national tv #debates
Theres currently a delusional, cheeto dust-covered goblin with teeny hands and a temper of a 2 year old running for president. #Debates
"Braggadocious". That would be the one word longer than three syllables that Donald would know.  #debates
Thank you audience for laughing at the absurdity of his comment, "I have a better temperament." #debates
#debatenight Hillary getting crushed on Isis and she calls to move on!  Arrogant.
Ummmm. Stop and frisk was in fact ruled unconstitutional. Didn't even need the fancy fact checkers for that. #Debates2016
"I think I did a good job."     You have to imagine that's also what he says after he takes a dump.  #debatenight
"Well, just listen to what you heard."      #debatenight
"provoked by a tweet should not be responsible for nuclear weapons" OKAY HILARY!! #debatenight #debates
I hope people see his ego in Trump's answer on the birther issue. #debatenight
Allowing Jews and blacks into the Palm Beach Country Club is racist #debates
Trumps answer is have a police state to heal race relations FOH #debatenight
After tonight if Trump's poll numbers stay the same, it cleary a racist revolution happening. Worst debate performance ever #debatenight
Release your tax returns @realDonaldTrump or scare for the truth the be let out just like @VinceMcMahon #debatenight
First African-Anerican president to the first female president. Wondeful time to be alive to witness this epic moment #debatenight
DT: we are a third world country.  His supporters surely vote as one #Debates2016
Go Hillary, go Hillary, It's your birthday, it's your birthday 🎉 #debatenight #imwithher
Trump using the word "cavalier" is legitimately laughable. Don't use words you don't understand buddy #Debates2016
US allies don't pay the US for protection. What the fuck is he on about? #debates2016 #PresidentialDebate
Donald Trump, you think us Black people REALLY believe that you care about us? #Debates2016 #debates #PresidentialDebate
||: There are three fires around me and the debates on..I think it's a sign
I think implicit bias is a problem for everyone not just police - well said HRC #debatenight #ImWithHer
@realDonaldTrump as a former auditor release your taxes there is NO RISK to you. Liar #Debates2016
@realDonaldTrump you called the black president a non American. But you're good for race? God ur lost! #Debates2016
"Not paying federal income tax makes me smart". - presidential nominee Trump #cinnamonhitler #debatenight
.@HillaryClinton just nailed Trump about discriminating against African Americans in his building. He was sued twice for it. #debatenight
Giving a lecture on the emails still doesn't answer the question about tax returns. #debatenight
Hillary u used a private server to secretly communicate &amp; put the States at risk for enemies. Don't speak about cyber security!#debatenight
I cant believe this is what its come too. This is our America, guys. #debatenight
#debatenight working with Muslim countries? You mean the ones that @HillaryClinton has taken 100's of MILLIONS of $$ from
Trump is coming to Bernie Sanders' defense. This is the most hilarious thing I've heard in a while.  #Debates
"I'm going to be blamed for everything that's ever happened." "Why not?" "Sure, why not?" Lol...these two. #debatenight
I love that Trump thinks Americans only care about money related issues. Really? Presidents are more than business and budget. #debates
#debatenight if HRC is si Up posed to be trying to come across as more likeable, she's failing.
Had to pause the debate to pick kids up - pressing play now. Shhh... don't tell me what I missed! 😂#debatenight
It's not about who's the better candidate anymore, it's about who is worse and vote for the other person #Debates
We really need to cyber better. A/S/L is not enough! My kid is a very against cyber 10 y/o computer genius. That makes me smart!#Debates2016
did someone tell lester to grow a pair and to put trump in his place? this is seriously ridiculous. #debates
How is Donald gonna cut taxes and Hillary raises them? Either way we are doomed.#debatenight
R2 for Clinton 10-9 on taxes, since Trump hides tax returns. But Trump is losing it, yelling and interrupting. #debatenight
"Two words... Law. And order. A terrific show, a really, really tremendously successful show. We need to bring the show back." #debatenight
Trump is just so awkwardly inarticulate. I don't think he's losing any votes tonight though #Debates2016
They both suck but Lester Holt is clearly working against Trump #mediabias  #debates
I'm waiting for Ashton Kutcher to walk on stage and tell America we just got punk'd. @realDonaldTrump @HillaryClinton   #debatenight
"We've got to address the systemic racism in our criminal justice system."  YES @HillaryClinton #Debates2016
Lester Holt is about to tell Trump to just 1. stop interrupting him and 2. listen to what the question is #debatenight
Did the man say he's been getting to the African-Americans "for the last little while"? You can't this stuff up. #DebateNight
@debates. #DebateNight is an insult to the 62% of America that wanted to #LetGaryDebate the real issues. #letgarydebate
The people that should not have guns are Cops!! They are the biggest gang in America #Debates2016 #reEducateUS
"I was the one who got him to produce the birth certificate." Pretty sure that's something to NOT be proud of Donny.  #debatenight
Trump: you went after Obama, but now I'm defending him! So you can't say I'm always after him. So there! #Debates2016
I don't care about emails. I don't care about tax returns. Can't imagine I'm alone in this. Lester, get your stuff in order. #debates
Maybe one of the emails Hillary deleted contained Trump's tax returns #debatenight #PresidentialDebate
HRC confirms stop &amp; frisk found unconstitutional. Supports community policing. Warns about systemic racism. #Debates2016
Appreciate that he's now debating Lester, he wasn't doing all that well against Hillary.  #debatenight
So I broke down and turned on the #debatenight I like to look for which looks presidential. They get my vote. One does. The other doesn't.
Trump: I've been all over. Me: Yeah. Just like dog poop. #debatenight
Yeah, but like why was it so important that Obama produce a birth certificate? You can't answer that without admitting racism. #debatenight
Trump finds so many things "unbelievable" he'd probably die of shock after 20 minutes in the Oval Office. #debatenight
Taking the oil is illegal. I only bring it up because you keep saying law and order. #debates
"goes off to the golf course for the rest of his life to play golf" trump, expert orator #debates
Hillary's forced grin while Trump talks is just creepy. Like uncanny valley creepy. #debatenight
It's time TO MAKE AMREICA A QATARI &amp; EMIRATIS AIRPORTS AGAIN without MUSLIM labours though #debatenight
Happy I'm not wasting my evening watching the debates considering I don't like either candidate.
Are Trumps hands getting smaller as he talks, or is it just relative to his nose growing? #Debates
HRC: Woo! Okay! Now rip him apart as he wishes that water was something stronger. #slays #Debates2016
Stop the fight!! Stop the fight!! If this was a boxing match they would call it  #debatenight #GoHillary
#trump needs to stop talking and take a breath before he loses it all #debatenight #debates
On scavenging the #housing bubble : "That's #business" On #tax returns non-disclosure: "That makes me smart" #DonaldTrump #Debates
Dumb and dumber debating tonight. Do we really even need a president? #debatenight
You mean "HIM." RT @jartaylor: #debatenight The invalid is stumbling over her words, losing concentration, forgets what the question was.
I'm just thinking about all the students that have to come up with essays on this debate. Just wow #Debates2016
Not watching the debates or twitter for two reasons. 1) The debate is a mess &amp; 2) watching who I consider intelligent lose their shit lol
"Maybe I'm trying to save the money." This is his idea of humor. Schmuck can't even joke right. #debates
I still can't believe that Donald Trump is standing up there as a presidential candidate. #debatenight
Let's stop and frisk all criminals, what do the look like @realDonaldTrump? Jim Crow here we come #debatenight
@pang Check @cspan - they should have it, along with debates going back years
The Donald turning "racial healing" into how Clinton is the originator of the birther movement. Cool story, bro  #Debates
I honestly question people's sanity that are still going to vote for Trump after watching this #debatenight
The amount of disdain Trump put on the word "knowledge" says it all. #debatenight
"You're wrong. It went before a judge who was a very against police judge." @realDonaldTrump #debatenight
T...p: "Well, first I have to say one thing..." ...buncha incomprehensible words... "take the oil..." He's lost it. #debatenight
really trump? our airports which feature multiple fast food restaurants and multiple stores are like "3rd world countries?" #DebateNight
We're now on the race portion: Watch closely - either one could brick this, with the quickness. #Debates2016
Ok, what the fuck? Trump's word salad is becoming positively Palin-esque.  #debatenight
Trump needs to go back to kindergarten and learn how to share. #shutup #debatenight
Want to hear more specifics on #Clinton plan to make college debt free. Will #Debates2016 get into the meat of any issues?
"Let me bring it down for a minute. Come close. It's important. I agree." #debates
Donald says Hillary takes the 5th...well, he would know about taking the 5th, because he is a pro at it...answer a damn question...#debates
Trump says he has a better temperament than Hillary Clinton &amp; the entire audience pissed themselves from trying not to laugh #Debates2016
If you have to find ways around the laws you're a criminal @realDonaldTrump #debatenight
"We settled the suit with no admission of guilt" - @realDonaldTrump says there were many others accused of similar claims #debatenight
So one of the reasons @realDonaldTrump is seeking to be president is because he has money. Really?  #AmoyawKasa #Debates2016
#debatenight can she talk about the issues &amp; not his personal business practices! Wtf! We want answers about issues not this bs!!
We don't have a trade deficit with *all* of the countries we do business with. #debates
"Your president"? Is Trump not an American citizen?  Show me the certificate!!! #debatenight
Speaking of which, @EarlSkakel why are you not sitting side stage you'd be having a field day #debatenight
#Debates2016  TRUMP DONT LET LESTER HUSH U... TALK OVER THEM THEY ALL ON KILLARYS PAYROLL
Omg, bigly! Bigly is when this went from bad to worser. #debatenight
Are people still surprised Trump can't correctly answer the question "How?" This is old hat for Trump in debates
am I the only one worried about Trump's health during this debate? hmmmm #Debates2016
Trump has a "winning temperament"? still trying to process that one...bahahahah #Debates2016
Plz let Trump keep talking he's about to drop the nbomb.  #debatenight
Not particularly impressed with their answers on this tho I think they should move on to the next  #debatenight
#Clinton: "Maybe he's [Trump] not as rich as he says he is." #Debates
If you get audited every year, that should tell you something! #Debates2016
I hope Clinton continues to school Trump. His childish tantrums during the debate is not very presidential. #Debates2016
@LesterHoltNBC deserves to not pay any taxes this year after taking this job #debatenight
Trump's law and order would be authoritarianism. Blame Obama. Exalt Giuliani. Blame immigrants. #debatenight #ImWithHer
1 hour in and still no mention of a wall. I think I'm disappointed. #PresidentialDebate #DonaldTrump #debatenight
Watching Netflix instead of the debate because we're already screwed either way #debatenight
north korea really should do us a favor and nuke everything before it gets shittier #debates
How has this man not even mentioned police brutality once in this speech on race #debates
Is it me or does Trump look less orange to appeal to more voters? Like he's significantly less fluorescent. It's almost creepy #Debates2016
#debatenight #Debates2016 So the guy who praised Hillary in 2008 now says it's unfair for her to praise her former opponent from that year.
The idea of race divide is not only about crime, law and order.Shame on both. #debates
Trump: "Like I told you we should have stolen an entire counties natural resources it worked on the Native Americans" #debatenight
His record shows? What record Lester? He's never been a politician #debates #Debates2016   #debatenight
@realDonaldTrump just admitted he "takes advantage of the laws in this nation" WHY IS RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT?? #ImWithHer #Debates2016
@HillaryClinton was "in the room when it happened, yo!" #ImWithHer #Debates2016   Cc: @unfoRETTAble
NATO doesn't focus on "Tera"? Who is "Tera"?! Is she fine, b/c if so she deserves some focus... #debatenight #debates
@HillaryClinton just check your website for fact checking? Yeah because you are known for truth and honesty. @realDonaldTrump  #debatenight
The summary of debate:  @realDonaldTrump: Our country would be better if... @HillaryClinton: Your business, your tax bla bla... #debates
How big of a fucking mess are Donald’s finances that an audit takes 14 months? You can audit Bank of America in less time. #debates
That's it. I'll be watching. @thewestwingTV on @netflix the rest of the night for a more hopeful debate. #debatenight
#Debates2016 I don't live in a 3rd world country! My America is already great!!!
THAT WAS THE FIRST TIME SHE ACTUALLY OWNED UP TO THE EMAILS AND ACTED LIKE IT WASNT EVEN THAT BIG OF A DEAL #Debates
Omg called out overweight people vChina ir 400# person in bed #debatenight
Trump has told 31 lies so far by my count. Make that 32 as I'm typing this. #debatenight  #factcheck
NATO has to pay their dues but Donald doesn't have to pay his taxes? #DebateNight
@realDonaldTrump "We have to know what we're doing" even if he doesn't #Debates2016
Trump claims he has the highest support amongst police and armed forces. @GovGaryJohnson, thoughts? #debatenight #debate
Key and Peele take off the masks... We know it's you #DebateNight #ThisIsActuallyFunny
"I have the feeling that I'm going to be blamed for everything..."-Sec. Clinton 🙄🙄🙄 "Why not?"-Donald Trump #debatenight #debates #maturity
Thank you for moderating here, Lester. I need more talking and less interrupting. #debatenight #debates #PresidentialDebate
#trump: “most gang members are illegals”  can you prove that claim, dumbass? #debatenight #debate
Trump always looks like a small child who is telling an elaborate lie to his mother about why he bullied another kid. #DebateNight
@HillaryClinton how will we push ISIS out of Iraq with no boots on the ground? #debatenight
"idk, who knows, maybe, essentially"- Donald  dawg..what DO you know?   #debatenight
"I have better temperament..."   *keeps interrupting and yelling*   Over and over and over again.  #debatenight
I hear there is a debate on TV ?  #debatenight  💩😂😂💩
The segment 'securing America'...oh this will be fun...😩 Though Hillary starting on cyber is very pleasing! #debatenight
That moment when trump calls the USA a third world country. Wowza. #debatenight
Honestly happy I can't vote like who would I be voting for bad or worse #debatenight
How do you feel, @realDonaldTrump? That sounded like a little haiku there. #debatenight
wait, it's unusual for the NYTimes to be honest? One of the most respected voices in journalistic integrity... #Debates2016
@imdadawan if only we too had open debates here. People would even stop voting at all :D
Interesting to see that the GOP has given up on pretending to be the "small government" party. #debatenight
can someone give Lester a water gun? it works when my cats are fighting #Debates2016
"Why am I feeling this way?" @HillaryClinton 😂 Liberalism is a mental disorder. #debatenight
Still Can't Believe Trump Got This Far Fucked Up Ass World #debatenight
Oh who haven't I offended tonight? People of size? Lets go after them too. #400lbHacker #debatenight #PresidentialDebate
Every time Law and Order is mentioned I have to resist the urge to see if SVU is on #Debates2016
Definitely more like a #verbal #boxing #match than a debate already hitting below the belt 😬🙈💩 #debatenight
From China to NAFTA to Dugout Doug MacArthur to ISIS...all in one question. Thanks @LesterHoltNBC - what a time to be alive indeed! #debates
@realDonaldTrump Just called our airports third world.  THEY ARE SO FAR FROM THIRD WORLD. This is madness #debatenight
She actually didn't take responsibility for that. It's a federal crime #Debates
"A judge who was a very against police judge". Yells like a three-year-old, lies like a three-year-old, talks like a three-year-old #debates
Trump just praised his son's mad computer skills. From a man who never touched a computer, is very credible #debate #debatenight #debates
"Who is behind cyberattacks against the US?"  Trump: BERNIE SANDERS WAS TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF   #debatenight
What a "get credit whore" Donald want credit for any and everything! #Debates2016 #Debates #debatenight
there's still ppl supporting trump after this debate ? What ? I'm confused don't ppl have like common sense ? #Debates2016
God forbid Hillary actually has REAL EXAMPLES and Trump just talked in BS and generalities #DebateNight
If you're watching #debatenight I hope you've got beer! Alcohol is needed! #truth
Sooo... no paying your federal taxes makes you smart... dear lord... #debatenight #Debates2016 #debates
"I have a better temperament than she has," audience laughs derisively #debatenight
kinda said that Trump isn't referring to Hillary as Crooked Hillary. #debatenight
Trump: Unfit to lead Petulant.  400lb fat-person in bed is a threat to 'Merica My 10-year old son Cyber needs to be done better #debates
Trump: You want me to bridge the racial gap? Let me spew some more racist nonsense instead.  #debatenight #Debates2016
Oh so @seanhannity needs to get his own batman symbol in the sky for when ever Donald needs to call him. #debatenight #Debates2016
Thank you trump for finally telling the people Bernie was sabotaged by his own party #debatenight #democrooks
How did @realDonaldTrump get to the trade deficit from a question about tax returns? #debatenight #j153
Felons with guns are not being tried federally. Enforce those laws we already have. #Debates2016 #DebateNight
OffTopic: @realDonaldTrump the hair is distracting but grats in being less orange. #Debates2016
@HillaryClinton DONT use the same clap back twice. The tweet clap back isn't funny. Your clapback to his clapback was decent. #Debates2016
WE WOULDN'T BE IN DEBT IF YOU'D PAY YOUR GD TAXES, HOMIE #debatenight
@realDonaldTrump over 70% of #Americans believe we need #ComprehensiveGunReform You are out of touch with #RealAmericans #Debates2016
Military equipment costs are too high? But they are also American-made… #debatenight
It's n surprise, but her strategy seems to be to let him reel out his own rope for the hanging. #debatenight
"The record shows otherwise…" "The record shows I am RIGHT." this s the nut of the debate, fact versus Donald-world #debatenight
Why can't we #LetGaryDebate ? Please?! The #debates are seriously between a giant douche and a turd sandwich.
I hope people of color are thoroughly listening to Trump's stop and drink ideas. #Debates
Pretty clear Trump doesn't understand stop and frisk. Or inner-cities. Or constitutionality. Or debating. #debatenight
"A mother's boy has never wept, nor dashed a thousand kim." —Donald Trump #Debates2016
Hillary: Institutionalized racism is to blame  Trump: Black people are to blame   #Debates2016
Hillary sounds like some robot with every answer she gives. Like vomiting each word one at a time....  #debatenight
"Secretary Clinton, your response?" HRC: I hope Americans are smart enough to fact check. Me too. #debates
Just a second, Lester. I'm going to interrupt your facts with some blatant racism. - basically #Trump #debatenight
#debatenight there it was blame George Bush 7 &amp; 1/2 years later...
I have a question: name one black friend that isn't connected to you politically. #Debates2016
Did Trump actually admit that he agrees with Hillary on something?? :D #Debates
Hi I'm Trump and I like to target other races then pretends to support them on national debates.. hmmmmm #debatenight
Did he do bumps in the bathroom with Melania? @HillaryClinton   #drumpf #debatenight
it is a fact that the same crime by a Black man and White man will more likely lead to an arrest of the Black man. @HillaryClinton #debates
The Donald is all over the place. It's called shuffling. Pay attention #debates
Trump is saying cause he has property in Chicago we need to have stop and frisk in Hispanic &amp; black communities. #cnn #debates #debatenight
Where the hell did that emoji come from and what is it? Damn cyber! #Debates2016

@angela_rye Trump is drinking all that water to keep his lies moist! 🍶 #debates
Trump has been sipping water so many times now.  More than Marco Rubio. #Debates2016
dumpster fire. reluctantly voting for clinton, so no need to watch this crap. back to mnf. #debatenight
You were a secretary of state when ISIS was a little infant. Now it's a 400 pound gorilla... Donald Trump on #debatenight
Donald, Lester asked about race relations...what the hell are you talking about! You are way off track! #debatenight
Just because you settle with no admission of guilt, doesn't mean you are guilty. #Debates
@cristinalaila1 last time I checked the FBI said the non-profit status was for operating the Clinton library. Only. Not overseas #debates
For 40 yrs, all candidates for Prez have shared tax returns. Why on earth aren't @realDonaldTrump supporters concerned about this?? #debates
If there was no picture, I'd swear Trump had a coke spoon at his nose. #sniff  #USPresidentialDebate #debatenight
does trump realize it's super illegal to not pay federal taxes not "smart"? #Debates2016 #debatenight @realDonaldTrump
If everyone in the 70's was discriminating why are you singling me out is Trump's answer?  What a dickhead. #debatenight
I guess we need to get someone to get Trump to produce those tax returns. #DebateNight
Essentially Trump just said "We don't need a duck to pull a truck. We have a Trump to pull a truck." #debatenight
"Bad people... Bad people" I think we all know who the bad person is #Debates2016
It's an insult to the legacy of Ronald Reagan for Trump's surrogates to continue calling Trump "Reagan-esqe". #debatenight
Nice tying in her father into the type of people that Trump stiffed. #debatenight
they done gon ahead and tightened Donald hair piece a lil too much, my mans trippin 🤕 #debatenight
I would appreciate if the candidates to serve the people of this country would focus on the people of this country. #debates
#DebateNight #trump obligation is to do well for company and my family and my employees
Trump lost this debate before he walked in the building....he never answers questions asked #debatenight #Debates2016
@HillaryClinton must be part camel. WHY AREN'T YOU DRINKING ANY WATER?!?!? 🐫 #Debates2016
Oh good for you, Mr. Trump. So good of you to allow minorities at this one random club #debatenight
This motherfucker is talking about how terrible our airports are...you can clearly see what the fuck he's worried about #debatenight
Trump doesn't even know how to answer a question directly without drifting off to another subtopic. #debatenight
#debates My god!!   Hillary is calling for a fact check.  How hilarious.  She is the one telling the lies!
That's usually what settling consists of, right?? Nooo admission of guilt due to a monetary pay out to shut em up?? #AskRayLewis #debates
Hillary thinks ransom and putting Iran on path to nuclear weapons is diplomacy? #debatenight
#Trump He sounds like a fourteen year old boy trying to wing an oral book report never having read the book #PresidentialDebate #debatenight
#Clinton: Too many military-style weapons on streets. Right now, in some places, police are outgunned.//Agree? Disagree? #debatenight
#Clinton: "Birther" lie was hurtful one. #Obama is man of great dignity. Could tell how hurtful it was for him.//Thoughts? #debatenight
#Clinton: Man who gets upset over a tweet should not have access to nuclear weapons.//Thoughts on temperament of each? #debatenight
The IRS has literally released a personal statement that he doesn't have to wait to release his tax forms. #debatenight
I bet hillary just wants a glass of wine now and giggle #debatenight
Really airports?  I dont need a shopping center at the airport. Although Charles De Gaulle &amp; Heathrow are nice #debatenight
Hillary has been respectful and has used facts and has been calm, and trump is over there like a child who lost his binky #debates
Who wants to join me in burning this club to the ground? #debates Why is this even a thing he's going on and on about?
To be fair, lots of people don't want to talk to Sean Hannity. #Debates #Debates2016 #debatenight
All trump's supporters R tuning out 4 this. They dont care abt birtherism. He did a good job raising/diffusing the issue b4 the #Debates2016
can someone give Sniffy McSniffFace a tissue! And tell him to stop ranting. What a dick! #debatenight
We need some "Law and Order" in this debate, Lester.   #debatenight
He just wants to give a lot of things, you guys, in order to respond! #debatenight
"all talk no action" i think you just described yourself, trump... #debates
Are you watching #debatenight ? What do you think both candidates lack in #publicspeaking ??
#Debates American airports are not 3rd world country airports...  I'm sorry trump. That's just not true.
I feel like I'm watching 2 genius kindergarten kids arguing for the orange Recess Patrol vest. #debates #debatenight #Debates2016
Horrible airports? What's he got against airports? He uses private airfields. Our airports are fantastic! #Debates2016
I swear trump has mentioned China at least 50 times so far #debatenight
#debates Lester helps Hillary out by challenging Stop and Frisk! Why is it his job to do that? also Stop &amp;Frisk was not ineffective!!
Did Trump just compare us to third world countries based on the appearance of our airports?? #Debates2016
I'd rather have a president that knows how to make a payroll than a president who knows how to bank everyone else's pay. #Debates2016
@HillaryClinton #Boom "Maybe because you haven't paid any Federal Income Tax 4 a lot of years!" #debatenight @therealdonald_ needs a tissue
Hillary's dad installed blinds, creating shade. His daughter became a politician and throws shade. COINCIDENCE? #debatenight
There's a 10% chance Trump thinks "ISIS" is like Iceland for Muslims filled with extremist polar bears who hate our country. #debatenight
slamming Janet Yellin and being condescending about Obama's post presidency plans #debatenight
Um...settling without an admission of guilt doesn't mean you weren't guilty Donald. It meant you got away with it. #shame #debates
How is it that the cast from Parks and Rec has the best live tweets? #debatenight
In the first 20 min Trump called Hillary a Loser, and Hilary plugged her book and website. George Washington is crying in Heaven. #debates
Trump would lose the thread if they asked him who was his favourite character in Friends. #debatenight
I am a 60 year old female and I hope I live long enough to see the generation of men who think like Trump gone!!! #debatenight
HC: I have thoughts and I would like to --- DT: "WHAT ABOUT #DAESH, HIL? WAY TO POLITIK, HIL" - said with zero experience.   #Debates2016
Trump visibly and audibly sighed when Hilary said he painted the African American community in a bad light #really #debatenight #butyoudid
How are we going to "train out" racist police officers girl?! @HillaryClinton 🤔🤔🤔 #debatenight
Judging by her mannerisms, Hillary knows the best shade is nonverbal. #debatenight
"I have a feeling by the end of this debate I'm going to blamed for everything" - Hillary. "Why not?" - Trump #debates
Trump is just throwing out numbers at this point that have no meaning. Also, he just said "bragadocious" That's not a word #debates
I'd love to have $1 for every time he says believe me #Election2016 #debatenight #PresidentialDebate #ImWithHer
For all of the Hilary supports let me ask y'all a question  #Debates
@HillaryClinton wants to work with the nations that have been slaughtering infidels, women, and the #LGBTQ community. #debatenight
Why does he keep raising his voice like a spoilt step-child throwing a trantrum.. #debatenight
My favorit- "30 YEARS!" ..um, my favo- "JOBS!" myfavoriteparto- "GOLF COURSE" ...ah forget i- "AUDIT!" #debatenight
Coming this Fall from Executive Producer Dick Wolf - Law &amp; Order: Hell in Chicago #debatenight
Hahaha!!!   Here goes Clinton again!!!  Fake scripted garbage#Debates
The hypocrisy of Hillary saying Trump has something to hide in his tax returns is absolutely nauseating. #DebateNight
Hillary trots out the dividing leftist narrative that every white person in the US is racist. Awful. #debatenight
He's basically saying that we need to enforce more police brutality to stop black on black crime. #Debates2016
Ohhh check you out Hilary. Talmabout "I prepared to be president". I see you girl LMAO #debatenight #debates
Hillary has been combating ISIS her whole adult life. I didn't realize ISIS has been around for 50 years! Donald just say shit.#Debates2016
#debatenight How many times has Hilary interupted Trump? Trump continually interupts her. He's trying to be a bully..
@realDonaldTrump is a mess up there! Cant stay on the topic to save his life #debates
Why you gotta fire shots at Obama for playing golf? It's a nice leisurely activity!!!! #debatenight
Trump just hit her with that "super-predator" comment!! There we go.... #debatenight
We need law and order. The original, Svu, criminal intent, and all the rest #debates
I think there's a political reason you can't say it. #superpredator  #debatenight #Debates2016 #Debate #PresidentialDebate #SickHillary
Saudi Arabia pays us for defense, but it goes to the Clinton Foundation.  #Trump #debatenight #Debates2016 #PresidentialDebate #debates
Don't worry #Charlotte, Trump loves you because he has investments in your city. #ImWithHer #debates
#debates. Hmmm. Attacking MSM...Trump denying his original support of Iraq war...doubling down as usual.
The coolest thing about the debate is that rappers use the trump and Clinton names in songs #DEBATES2016.
Nobody cares about taxes except for Hillary and those who drink the koolaid. #debatenight
Can u believe a pres candidate just shilled4 his self &amp; did commercial during a presidential debate? #Deplorables #debatenight #Debates2016
I just thigh slapped my husband in excitement, watching #HillaryClinton 's face during that defense. #Debates2016
Trump says the wealthy are going to create jobs. Are we talking about the same 1% the 99% have been hating the last few years? #debates
If I had the motivation, I'd be setting up the @400poundhacker account right now. Trusting someone's on that. #debates
And now over to Trump and Hillary talking oil! Take it away, y'all! #Debates
#debatenight #FACTCHECK The fact is that factcheck is always behind the fact what is being told. The real fact is what is best for #USA
Guns dont kill people. People kill people. Taking guns away wont stop that. #debatenight
I was just endorsed, it'll be over 200 next week .. by admirals. And generals. Veers and Piett, many others. They want leadership. #debates
These two people are our only "hope" for being leaders. God. Help us. #debatenight
Even with the Dublin bus strike being incredibly inconvenient, at least we don't have to worry about @realDonaldTrump #debatenight #IREvUSA
@Brok3nOne ... I gotta bounce and catch the replay later. The debates always bore  me. Plus dudes voice is annoying as sin.
I think @realDonaldTrump just said that ISIS was created by @BarackObama and @HillaryClinton ... #Debates #Hillary2016
Instead of discussing policy, they're already discussing the tax returns 😧 #debatenight #Debates2016
Trump is a cry baby and needs to let Hilary finish #debates
HRC finally gets out bush set the rules to get troops out, not Obama. Plus liability issue. USA can't stay w out Iraq agreement #debatenight
Trump sounds like a little kid "the record shows I'm right" bye shut up #debatenight
Donald Trump makes his $694 million dollars a year by selling a bunch of baloney  #debatenight
Hillary prepared to be president!  Trump can't even prepare his taxes. #Debates
So is it just black ppl that have gangs what of the biker gangs they don't have guns. Trump says a lot of nonsense for a father  #Debates
To reduce hacks let the nsa stop reading our internet usage #Debates
China has 1 billion ppl it has so much problems or bullshit is amazing #Debates
so i guess law and order only applies to civilians, police are above the law ?#debatenight
Also why do I care about the debates I'm no where near 18.
Trump said "Believe me" again. This is too much on my liver. I'm about to drink some water soon #debatenight
Let's be honest with ourselves. Did anyone answered the police brutality question? #debatenight
FED, POLITICAL, POLITICAL, FED FEDLITICAL POLITIFED...we get it donald trump, you know what the fed is #Debates2016
Responsible gun control, absolutely and thank you. @HillaryClinton for making some sense tonight #Debates2016
My inner psychology major is loving @HillaryClinton response on implicit bias. A lot of great experiments showing shes right. #Debates2016
Neither stayed on topic or listen to the moderator...yet they are gonna listen to the people 😂 #debates
Does Trump realize that all he's doing is constantly repeating himself over &amp; over again &amp;not actually answering any questions? #debatenight
#debatenight                  NEITHER       Rich people in a pit fight  while the poor hope for scraps    #auspol #abcnews24 #USA
Hillary has such a better pose than Trump. Him constantly yelling only makes him look even worse than he already is #debatenight
Uneducated hoes out here during presidential debates not knowing what to tweet, so you tweet "fav for a DM😏😈"...put ur titties away &amp; learn
Maybe it's the lateness of the hour but Trump's vocabulary is so limited I'm genuinely having trouble following this #debatenight
I think the first two questions were answered and after that I'm really not sure what real topic is being discussed #Debates
Hey Trump - do you even understand what the acronym NATO stands for? #DebateNight
I prepared for this debate. I prepared to be president. I think that's a good thing. *TRIGGERED TRUMP* #debates
Release the tax returns # Trump. You can't delete them so just release them #Debates2016
#Trump economics. A pretty airport and skipping out on paying taxes will lift you out poverty.  #Debates2016
.@realDonaldTrump is talking about his club in Palm Beach instead of talking about the state of race in America. #debatenight
oh no hills, I was with you until you started warmongering. #debatenight
Hillary. Hillary. Hillary. You don't pay them after they taunt your sailors publicly. #Debates
We've figured it out, Donald's Achilles heel is for anyone to think he isn't rich. #Debates2016
When they only way to get through the debate is with a drinking game 🙃😂 #debatenight
Did Donald Trump just try to prove he wasn't racist by saying that ONE of his clubs doesn't discriminate.  How many do?! #debates
He actually agreed with her. I had to wait to see if the world would just explode. #Debates2016
Alls fair in love and debates.... "I will release my tax returns when she releases her 33,000 emails." #debatenight
Man @YouTube could have won the night with a post debate/response with @DrJillStein and @GovGaryJohnson #debatenight
Trump won't release his returns. Who are we kidding. Just keep going round and round in circles... Geeez #debatenight
When does the mercy rule kick in? Game over @realDonaldTrump congrats @HillaryClinton  #debatenight
Hillary fans applaud and interrupt just like Trump fans...no difference there. #debatenight
Trump just served it up for Hilary to kill him on his point. #debatenight
#debatenight HRC shd point out airports &amp; infrastructure are broke bec republican Congress won't tax wealthy &amp; pay for any public growth
While watching the debate, I truly fear we may deserve an Armageddon asteroid coming our way. #debates  #DebateUSA2016 #screaming
The devil is wearing both a red dress and a suit tonight.. #debatenight
Personally looking forward to the debate where Lester Holt turns up #DebateNight
@LesterHoltNBC I am a @realDonaldTrump voter and I belief you are doing a good job #Debates2016 #TrumpPence
And you think you can rebuild infrastructure and lower taxes at the same time #Trump?  How will that work? It doesn't.  #debatenight
Um I'm no expert but don't people settle lawsuits when they know they fucked up so they're gonna buy out who sued them #Debates2016
#debates2016 Hillary again shows she is a grownup who can admit a mistake and keep it simple.
#debates2016 Gun violence a major major problem in our country - Hillary
#trump taking credit 4 getting Obama 2 produce his birth certificate after challenging Obama on it for years. What an asshole #debatenight
I am trying my best to finish the debate. I can't stand #Trump's face, voice, arguments...Everything about him is a joke. #debatenight
RT GovGaryJohnson "A 90 minute debate . . . that will require another 9 days for fact checking #debates"
UGH. Sick of the mudslinging. @debates. #debatenight is an insult to the 62% of America that wanted to #LetGaryDebate the real issues.
Trump seems thin skinned shooting from hip - reminder of the "Trumped-up trickle down" soundbite for any hacks who missed it #debatenight
Hillary is in a different league - stop &amp; frisk unconstitutional, importance of diversity, unfair US criminal justice system #debatenight
Trump said "I also have a better temperament than she has" -  he's going on the personal attack #debatenight
#debatenight @realDonaldTrump takes pride in military endorsements &amp; police, border patrol while @HillaryClinton endorsed by political hacks
She has kept her temper much, much longer then I ever could #debates
Poor Gary Johnson is probably watching thinking "THIS is what I would have been up against if I was allowed in the debate!?"  #debatenight
Your retweet on #DebateNight is  1 out of billions reason why I freaking love you so so much @trexhoney 💕
We were one of the MANY real estate firms that were discriminating against African Americans. #debatenight
@HuffingtonPost I think this is the first time Howard Stern has ever been mentioned during a Presidential debate. #Debates2016 #FactCheck
Business fact checkers have said that if he took the $ his dad left when he died and put it in the bank, he would be worth more.#debatenight
Are we allowed to just go in and take someone's oil? #Debates2016
If I had a dollar for every time the term "tax returns" was said I could reopen the Trump Taj Mahal. #Debates
This timeout from #debatenight coverage for the following important message: GO TRIBE! #tribetime @Indians
Lord knows this election needs an "intelligence surge" for a WHOLE LOTTA reasons.... #debatenight #Debate2016
Bro just said that his TEMPERAMENT is his best asset....y'all I can't even... #Debate2016 #debatenight
I "Take Advantage" of the laws of the nation. THIS DUDE is telling you he GAMES THE SYSTEM!!! Sheeeshhhh!!!!!!! #Debates2016 #debatenight
trump just said that not paying federal income tax makes him smart #debatenight
Is he really interrupting still though ... this is who you want to represent you America ?#Debates2016
Trump will care about your town if1) He owns property there 2) There's a 24 hour Arby's 3) There's a nice place to see tits #debatenight
Did @realDonaldTrump just plug his sons computer skills during the presidential debate? #debates #debatenight
#Debates2016 #therealdonaldtrump who the hell is the 400 pound shut in hacker exactly?  So so much wrong there. What a terrible man.
Our airports are like #thirdworldcountries?? I'm sure some 3rd world countries would like to debate that, sir. @realDonaldTrump #debatenight
I actually think it's time for me to leave America now: I just CAN'T with this debate. The amount of fear-mongering created rn #Debates2016
#Debates The violent crime could be instantly reduced if we simply locked @HillaryClinton up in prison. Suicide rates would plummet.
This debate funny I use to think debates were kinda lame till today gotta watch more..
Something both of the candidates don't understand, private debt =/= public debt. #debatenight #Debates2016
Does anyone else now have the Law &amp; Order theme song stuck in their head? #debatenight
#debatenight Two people arguing about why the other person is worse.  "worse" tax returns - emails Why not be the better person? #Release
I wish I didn't have to pay for shit I wasn't satisfied with like Trump...  I'd never pay for a thing.  #debatenight #Debates2016
Hillary Clinton says black &amp; brown communities need to "restore trust" with police...  When were they ever trustworthy?  #debatenight
#CrookedHillary complaining #trump didn't pay taxes didn't see her do anything about it as a senator #debatenight
#CrookedHillary your husband signed the bill you called them "those people" never wanted 2nd chance when signed #debatenight #VoteTrump
The United States of America is not "the biggest mess." The #UnitedStates is the strongest, best country in the world. #HillYes #debates
Hillary's camp is fact-checking in real-time. Trump's camp, apparently, is deleting history in real-time.  #PresidentialDebate #debatenight
If I was the moderator: will the both of you please SHUT THE FUCK UP #debates
Hillary looks like she's a giant red crayon without the paper on it in that pants suit #debatenight
"why won't he release his tax returns?" because he's donating to nambla #debates2016
How long did you last watching #Debates2016 before melting into an Alex Mack puddle?
Hilary is a kissass. Trying to win votes anyway she can. #debatenight
"If u really look at u will see that up IS down!" Trump says #Debates2016 #DebatesNight
I like that Clinton is smiling all the time it's probably making him lose his mind #debates
Can we not put Bernie on the ballot?  Like Fr.  My choices for president are the Idiot devil or the wishy-washy witch. #debatenight
Trump decides to threaten the American voters. If they don't vote me in, I will just take Pennsylvania Avenue. *smh* #debatenight
Honestly a good point by Trump-the African American community gets cared for during the election then forgotten for four years. #debatenight
Did anyone else just hear Donald say he doesn't pay federal income taxes because he's "smart"? #Debates2016
YOUR RECORD DOES NOT SAY THAT! Okay but are you looking at the record? #Debates2016
Hillary claims she wants to nuke Iran, instead gives them millions and calls that diplomacy.   #Debates #DebateNight #Debates2016
30 minutes in, and it's like I'm watching a horrific car crash. I don't want to look, but I can't turn away.  #Debates2016
Tax returns do not sway my vote, your policies and track record do.  #debates
Hillary is never ever going to cut taxes.  Look at all the people who have died under her watch!   #Debates2016 @debates @CPD
Can Hillary be more drugged up? Grandma has a Valium problem. How long before she hits the floor?  #Debates2016  @debates @CP #debatenight
Really scared to hear what #ToxicTrump has to say about race tonight. #Debates2016
This might be a good time to talk about the size of your privates, Donald #debatenight
Lester Holt "Stop and frisk was ruled unconstitutional." Donald: "No, you're wrong." Not so much, Donnie #debatenight
Stop and frisk was ruled unconstitutional you dumb ass orange dick head! #debatenight
#debatenight If SCOTUS goes fascist women minorities students and seniors all lose. Nuf said
#Debates #debate2016  RT @larrylbj1953: I'd rather see Hillarys Emails over Trump's tax returns
Did Hillary just tell Trump to apologize? Let's talk about our families who lost sons in Benghazi. Apology? #Debates
At any minute, he's going to reach down and bite into a piece of KFC. #Debates2016
Hillary needs to deliver a knock out blow. She hasn't landed a punch yet #comeongirl #debatenight
hicago has had thousands of shootings, reminds me of Syria.   It's run by former Clinton flunkie Rahm Emanuel.   #debatenight #debates
Is the sniffing due to the #Trump snorting NZT-48 pre-debate? Regret to inform him that it doesn't seem to be working... #debatenight
I'm honestly very proud that I've made my bf crack up over my tweets #DebateNight
Trump " I look advantage of the laws" to take advantage of people working for me. Exactly what this country needs, right? #debatenight
Race relations = keep black and brown folks under control with add'l police force #debatenight
If you're too dangerous to fly, you're too dangerous to buy a gun #hillary #Debates2016 #debatenight #ImWithHer

Trump on his company being sued for racist behaviour - it was the '70s everybody was doing it #debatenight
If i was the guy running the debate questions... i would have gone off by now... let the man finish the question! #debatenight
I don't think we really need to "bring back" Law &amp; Order. There's like a different one on every night. #debates
.@HillaryClinton I don't know what I just heard @realDonaldTrump made literally zero sense #debatenight #debates
Tonight the number of Americans simultaneously in a fetal position has crushed the all time record.  #debatenight
"I haven't given lots of thought to NATO" @realDonaldTrump is a complete moron #Debates
It's more than a little ironic that the candidate who modeled himself after Nixon is collapsing due to a televised debate #Debates2016
#debatenight 2008 Great Recession was caused by irresponsible mortgage lending. Had nothing to do with Hillary’s “Trickle Down” claims.
There you go! @HillaryClinton's started to play dirty! Politics! just so you know, I don't like either candidate..#debatenight
Hillary: Donald just criticised me. I'm prepared for that and I'm prepared to be president.   She killed Donald there. #debatenight #Debates
Neither of them answered the question! It was a question about healing the race divide. This is horrible! #DebateNight
How many worst deals has he ever seen, tonight I've counted two #debatenight

"I got to watch some of your debates...you treated him with terrible disrespect..." @realDonaldTrump on @HillaryClinton and Obama

I think it's great that Saturday night live won't need to add any hyperbole this weekend. #debatenight #PresidentialDebate
@mat_johnson Thank you for my 4th guffaw out loud moment of #debatenight / twitter (yes, I'm keeping count)
“@YOURERAClST: #debatenight hey donald? you do realize saying "you're wrong" repeatedly is not a valid argument right” thank you 😂
Finally Lester stepping in to call him on the tax return bullshit. #debatenight
Why bother, Lester? These people have no interest in questions. Just let them argue, it's what we're all here for. #Debates
Would someone please wake up David Dimbleby and put him on the next plane to New York so as he can moderate #debatenight?! @DIMBLEBOT
trump: yes I actively profiled the president and stuck by it for years but I was productive about it!!!!! #debatenight
I made it 10 minutes into the #debatenight before I had to walk away. 😡
Trumps refers to Obama as "your president" so is he not American? #debates
I hope my grandma isn't watching the debate..I don't want her blood pressure to go up again.. #debatenight
TRUMPS TAXES  ARE NOT A THREAT TO MY KIDS SECURITY!!!!!!! #debatenight
You know it's a rough night when you say someone is wrong before they can even finish their sentence #debatenight #debates
Hey look there was this one time I wasn't racist. I GOT ONE! Very proud. #debates #debatenight
#debates @realDonaldTrump Reconciliation does work that way. @HillaryClinton brings opposition together, professionally and gets results.
@fromTGA It feels horribly like watching those awful Brexit debates again - logic and reason couldn't cut it
I'm pretty sure @realDonaldTrump just confirmed he paid no federal income tax #debatenight #Debates2016
The way he says "Secretary Clinton" makes me think he believes that her job was stenography. #debatenight
Get over the freakin' emails. I understand the significance, but dear Lord do not encourage this xenophobic man #debatenight
I wonder how much coke does Don snort in a day? #Debates

Need help!! playing scrabble and I'm stuck, have letters BGYLI any ideas??? #Debates2016 🤔
This has nearly devolved to the point of two apes slinging shit at eachother. I cannot believe these are our "top two" choices. #Debates2016
I really don't understand the whole " you made a lot of money that's bad" play. #Debates2016
Does anyone else wish we could get a reset of the #2016presidentialelection #Debates2016 is this really the best we have to offer?
"Very nasty commercials" commercials that are literally just videos of things you have said that you won't own up too? #debatenight
No more debates for Trump ....he said your president ....so Obama is not his president
So really his whole campaign is about a Law&amp;Order comeback #debatenight law&amp;order trump style
It takes courage and conviction to even raise the "gun epidemic" in a tight election. Well done @HillaryClinton #ImWithHer #debatenight
Yeah Donald what about paying these people?  Oh wait..forgot who I was talking to...#Debates2016
YES! Remind these candidates this discussion is about race, Lester Holt 👏🏾👏🏾 #debatenight #debates
I really worry that trump doesn't realize that there really is little he can do on his own as president. thx, checks and balances #debates
"Somebody sitting on their bed who weighs 400 pounds?" There goes the south.#Debates2016

The Democratic Party is having a Costanza jerk store moment with getting blamed for Iraq. #Debates2016
#Trump talks about the pain of the Rich not being able to get their money as a Middle Class American I say FUCK YOU rich people #debatenight
#Trump will probably say "I think all cops should be like Judge Dredd" #debatenight
I'm waiting for somebody to jump on stage and say we're are being Punk'd. #debatenight
Clinton smart to just let Trump hang himself with his bragging about his temperament and judgment....   #debatenight
"I have a much better temperament than secretary Clinton!" **Audience Laughs** #Debates #FightNight
He's telling the truth. Just you go ask sexual harassment news and they will tell you. #debatenight

Everything bad that has happened to me I'm going to start blaming on Clinton since it's the popular thing to do. #Debates2016 #ImWithHer
#debatenight wow!!! What a load of bull. #DonaldTrump is full of it about the black Americans.

Usually when someone appeals to Sean Hannity it's my uncle at Thanksgiving #debates
Trump is just now being a stage whore.  Debates mean TWO are debating   Think he can turn this into one of his hate rallies   #debatenight
Reminder: @PatToomey wants Donald Trump to President. And he wants you to vote for him too. How about... neither? #debatenight #PASenate
Haha ok, Hillary talking about cyber security is actually funny #debatenight"We have to make this the top priority" I bet you wish you had..
At what point do they play "a cut off the new album" so I can go to the restroom?? #debatenight
So he doesn't pay taxes or pay up to small business who do work for him. Not my president #debatenight #debate2016 #Debates2016
@realDonaldTrump man, your an IDIOT! Lol ...comes out looking like a sour puss! #CNN #debatenight
Anyone who was hoping for a strong finish from Trump, is either crying or laughing hysterically right now. #debatenight
I could literally live in any American airport how dare he say our airports are compared to that of third world countries lol #debatenight
#Debates2016 Guns and Drugs,, get the Drugs out, the guns will follow

"Know what else I'm prepared for? To be president of the United States" boom. Mic dropped. Can we be done now? #DebateNight #ImWithHer
Lester Holt says this section is about racial healing. Trump says I got him to produce the birth certificate. #debatenight #Debates2016
Trump most certainly does NOT have a better temper moment than Clinton has he ever read his own tweets? #debates
"Implicit bias is a problem for everyone, not just police" - #HRC #DebateNight
It only took @realDonaldTrump "the last little while" to come around to the African American community #Debates2016
Howard Stern, Sean Hannity...ho hum @realDonaldTrump Did you take your ADHD meds?  #Debates2016
I cringe every time I hear the audience clap/laugh for Hillary #debatenight
"We need law and order"  The first thing he's said that I agree with.  That show is amazing! #debatenight
"She's making a good point right now." "Well one of them has to." #debatenight
Clinton has a disturbing William Shatner hanging speech thing going on. Make it stop! #debatenight
Come on, no one in the US wants to paint eyeballs on xmas ornaments #debatenight
How does stop and frisk work without racial profiling?! It comes hand in hand. This cannot build relations #debatenight
Trump is answering questions as though he's meeting an essay deadline and no where near the word limit #debatenight
Trump comes across like someone who has just bought an AS Level politics textbook, his debating style is god awful. #debatenight #TheDebate
I told Sean Hannity that Duke would beat Notre Dame, just call him! #debatenight  (#GoBlue, hehehe)
#Debates2016 I am African American and I haven't decided that I like @realDonaldTrump in the last little while. #moretrumplies
I'm literally still just laughing from the 400-pound guy sitting on a bed #debatenight
Is Trump actually saying that we need MORE police presence in the street????? WTF WAS THAT WHOLE SPEECH #Debates2016 #debatenight
his asides make it really hard to follow his point... and i swear to god it's on purpose #debatenight
What is with this damn sniffling? Is this like snow sniffles? 😂 #Debates
And now he's going to brag to the dwindling middle class about how rush he is. #neenerneener #debatenight
If she wants to protect us in America she can start by saying the words "radical islamic terroism." She still hasn't said it. #Debates
I literally cannot believe Trump is still trying to defend the birth certificate thing oh my god #DebateNight
Big point here: No matter the interruptions, mansplaining, bullying, Hillary has not gone down to his level. Presidential #debatenight
Trump: blah blah "bad things", blah *don't answer question* blah blah *insert scare tactics here"  #debatenight #PresidentialDebate
Mediator:Trump we have proof u said A Trump:no the record doesn't show  Me: sounds legit.No need 2 C proof #debatenight #PresidentialDebate

Watch the debates with someone who is gonna miss some parts to get you juice
Trump: I didn't support the war in Iraq Lester: The lie detector determined that was a lie  #debatenight
#Debates Poor Lester getting shut the fuck down every time he tries to interrupt Trump.
Again, Donald says Hillary was part of birther movement -- something we all know is a lie. Sniff! #Debates2016
HRC points the finger at Russia for cyber-attacks. Mentions Trump's bf Putin. Can he take the heat or will he attack? #Debates2016
Trump would be cut from any ninth grade debate team by now. Unbelievable that he is on a national stage. Sniff. #Debates2016
HRC: Donald has consistently insulted Muslims when we need to be working with them. #debatenight
Donald says he didn't support the war in Iraq and that the sky is orange and grass is blue. "Unbelievable!" #Debates2016
If Trump says his strongest asset is his temperament, we know we're being punked! #Debates2016
Hillary is propping herself up on the podium with her elbows. Severe swaying #Debates
Co operating with muslim nations is working well for the EU #Debates
Greedy trust fund baby Trump wants to give top 1% and himself massive tax cuts. Trickle down nonsense has been discredited #debatenight
"Mental health is a big issue our police are dealing with" - @HillaryClinton #DebateNight  and how will she concretely address that?
I bet my left kidney that Trump can't even name 30 countries #debatenight
#Trump on the stock market: "We are in a big, fat, ugly bubble." #debatenight
#Trump's I'll release my tax returns when she releases her 33000 deleted emails causes audience to break the no applause rule. #debatenight
#Trump to #Hillary: "When you try to act holier than thou it really doesn't work." #debatenight
Once again he's fear mongering and doesn't realize he's the one to fear. #debatenight
Listing airports. . . . . oh shut up donald.  #Debates

This guy is freakin' scary. NUTS. No idea what is going on in the world beyond #trump towers. He lies, cheats, and insults.#debatenight
Honestly, Trump, how do you lose to Clinton on a question about cybersecurity? #debatenight
A 400 pound hacker? Where does he come up with these lines. #debatenight
And that bitch couldn't answer the question... Why is he HERE???!!!! #debates #Debates2016
@mrsmoats52 I'm really scared for the future of our country! I've been trying to have a baby. This is totally making me rethink  #debates

His friends say that is not a lot of money? What? His friends see his red returns? #debatenight
I agree with Hillary. End for profit prisons. They use inmates for cheap labor. It's not justice, it harvesting cheap labor. #debatenight
Trump can't help but be impressed with Hillary. He's Looks like he is learning. He is out of the ultra con bubble &amp; amazed #debatenight
Is @LesterHoltNBC actually going to moderate this debate? Or will he allow @realDonaldTrump to ignore all rules of debate? #debatenight
Why isnt Hilary wearing an American flag pin on her lapel like all politicians do? Is she trying to get Kaepernicks vote? #debates
Donald is very, very angry tonight and has not smiled once! Why is he so mad? #DebateNight
ZING!! I know you haven't paid any federal income tax for years. #Debates2016
Trump can't even keep a Casino open let alone run a country #debatenight
#1uVote #debates2016 with a con man you have to watch what he does, not what he says. And here what he's doing is hiding his tax returns.
Clinton says would spend more money to retain police officers on racial bias #Debates2016
#debatenight Who keeps their military style weapons on the street? Everyone I know locks em up. (All firearms for that matter) #2a @nra

"Watch Party" groans when Trump says "I love Charlotte-I have business in Charlotte"  #debatenight
#Trump shut up about the no fly list. Guns make for a polite society #debates
Does Trump realize that he just explained himself as a "typical politician" #debatenight
#debates #Debates2016 @realDonaldTrump now arguing with Lester Holt, or more specifically, lying loudly at him.
My allergies literally started the moment I put the debate on...so yes it is possible to be allergic to stupidity  #debatenight #DumpTrump

"We are in a big fat ugly bubble..." I wonder what will happen to that bubble if Trump becomes president? #DebateNight #debate2016
Why would a routine audit prevent you from releasing past tax returns? Go Lester go. #DebateNight #debate2016 #trumptaxreturns
"Maybe because you haven't paid any federal income tax in many years..." "it would be squandered if I did..." WHAT?! #Debates2016
HRC should not be talking about the dangers of foreign money and weapons - her support for KSA makes it an easy jab for Trump. #debatenight
What does "Bragadouces" mean?  Did I spell it right? — watching Presidential Debates 2016
Just make him mad and he'll do it all to himself #debatenight #Debates2016
Lester: "can you talk about this specific policy" Trump: "uh, China should invade North Korea. with Iran. yeah, that's it" #debates
Why am i loving #debatenight so much? Idk. Why am i not studying for my Biology test? Idk

Lester: "that's racial profiling"   Trump: "no you're wrong it's constitutional"  #debatenight
"with no admission of guilt".   ummm.... that's not the same as being innocent. #DebateNight
By the time this is over, Trump will debate Lester Holt over whether or not he's actually Lester Holt.  #debatenight
He's just yelling nonsense, he's not winning anything. Children have more cool than him. #debatenight
I ain't rooting for either of them. It's just fun to watch. #debatenight
"I take advantage of the laws of this country."  Yeah mate, I think that's the issue here #debatenight

"If you are too dangerous to fly, you are too dangerous to buy a gun." Yes! @HillaryClinton #Debates2016
#debatenight I feel bad for anyone trapped in that auditorium because these two have drained out all the oxygen in the room.
"It's all words. It's all soundbites."  No, Donald—it's all facts.  #debatenight
Trump saying his strongest asset is his temperament. #Debate over right?   #debatenight
#Debates2016 NAFTA  is the cause of manufacture leaving this country with the help of our government

I'm writing a letter to Lorne Michael's because this is definitely the worst SNL cold opener. #debatenight
Trump thinks that settling with no admission of guilt is the same as being found not guilty. #debatenight
.@World_First Except his son, who is just plain unbelievably good with computers #debatenight
It's about time that somebody ran this country who has an idea about money...Trump is right on!! #debatenight
Look folks, I'll release my tax returns as soon as the election is out of the way. #Trumptranslated #debatenight
Watch Trump didn't interrupt anymore! Ran out of things to say... phew #debatenight
Trump indirectly referring to Johnny Cash because "I've been everywhere"  #debatenight
The moderator should be able to control the microphones. SHUT UP, DONALD, IT'S NOT YOUR DAMN TURN! #debatenight
Does Trump want to be President or CEO?? Jesus, who gives a shit about your real estate? #debatenight
Do you even know what it means to be a developing nation? Not to mention that you're still using the term "third world" #debatenight
"There are a number of things we can do better. Cyber is one of them." #accidentalpornquotes #debatenight
Countries should not be proud of rearmament of nuclear weapons it is not the Cold War #debatenight

"@realDonaldTrump was def doing bumps in the green room before the #Debates " - @Annie_Warhall #Debates2016
Blows my mind that these are the two best people a country of 300 million can pick to vie for the top job #debatenight

@HillaryClinton  SIDE STEPPED THE BIRTHER ISSUE WHEN HER SUPPORTERS SAID IT IN '08. Don't play like you cared. #debatenight
Tonight's Big Takeaway: Trump babbles so he doesn't have to bother with facts. #debatenight
Trump says birtherism was Hillary's idea. If it was, why doesn't he glom on to her other ideas so strongly? #debatenight
Trump says a 400lb man is laying in bed hacking America. #ChrisChristie looks up from his computer and says "wha?" #debatenight
According to @realDonaldTrump black &amp; Hispanic people live in hell, own guns, wanna shoot people &amp; commit crimes. WTH. Lol #debatenight
He brags about taking advantage of the laws of the nation. How would we want him to lead the nation. #debatenight
Can we get politifact or snopes to moderate a #debate where the candidates have to wait while they fact check their statements? #debates
"You know what else I prepared for? I prepared to be President." #BOOM @HillaryClinton #debatenight #Debates2016
Hillary giggling, realizing she is officially debating a petulant toddler speaking in tongues. #Debates2016
Clinton is looking at Trump with the same pity you look at your dog with when you know you gonna put him to sleep later #debatenight
"I take advantage of the laws of this country." Wait, that's a good thing? #Debates2016
I'm starting to think that when Hillary said "nice to see you Donald" at the top of this thing, mmmaybe stretching the truth. #Debates2016
Just week a go finished a road trip of about 2000 miles. America's roads are fine and road works are everywhere. Mr. PrivateJet #Debates
#debates If we don't have law and order, law and order, we don't have a country...why does Trump speak like Derek Zoolander
Gosh why don't we talk about her emails for just ANOTHER hour #debates
We just wasted a weird amount of time on a PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION for a very important country on emails and birtherism #debates
So when someone samples Trump's "wrong" into a super dope track, tag me, alright? #debates
I always like when real, powerful humans act as though nuclear codes are just a big red button #debates
#Trump is so weak that he could not win amateur hour contest if he tried. Making faces at #Clinton ? Seriously. How immature. #Debates2016
Stop and frisk is one of the most horrifying racist tactics ever deployed.  Bass Ackward Trump #Debates
Seriously wanna buy Lester multiple drinks rn. And give him hugs. #debatenight
Trump must believe that his followers / supporters will like him MORE if he interrupts and throws decorum out of the window. #Debates2016
I think you just saw another examples of bait and switch. #debatenight
You can keep naming them all day long...  Name one. Literally, name one you fucking twat. #debatenight

Trump called America a third world BOY IF YOU DONT GET! #Debates2016

"I take advantage of the laws of the nation"  He's basically a scam artist who manipulates the system for his personal gain. #debatenight
Donald Trump has developed good relationships with African Americans over the last little while. LOL! #Debates2016
Is Trump on meth? This is really his standard operating procedure? Scary. #debatenight #Debates2016
Lester Holt asks @realDonaldTrump if his stance on releasing his taxes is negotiable. You have been corrected, sir! #debatenight
I see no benefits from watching #debatenight.  I DO see benefits from playing with my 3DS as I snuggle in bed with my puppy.

DJT sucking air up through his nose sounds like someone going after the last dregs of their milkshake. #debatenight
The amount of wide-ranging info candidates in these debates have to have – on the spot, no matter how much cramming – is truly impressive.

Hey Donald, I am black and proud and don't live in "disgust."  What in hell are you speaking of? #Debates2016 @HillaryClinton
I could vote for her if purely based on her super human ability to remain calm and composed during this pile of 💩 #debates.
This is crazy...how the fuck did he make it this far?!?!?  #Debates2016
Who said the police had a good relationship with the community in Dallas?!?!? He just be making up shit.  #Debates2016
The audit has nothing to do with it. He can still do it, even with the audit. #DebateNight
"If we don't have Law &amp; Order, we don't have a country" That's a lot of pressure to put on a boxset. #debatenight
Trump knows what Michelle Obama said in her speech, his wife told him last night. #debatenight
Oh, sorry, someone not paying the US government what they're supposed to bothers you now Donald? #debatenight
He's talking about his son like he's the only kid good w/ computers. Bitch my 1 yr old cousin downloads apps daily #Debates2016
Did he get that crook in his neck from sucking cock?   #Debates
Clinton "I made a mistake with my private email and I take responsibility for that" #debatenight
Way to answer that hard question, Hillary: We all are subject to implicit bias. #dontbeliketrump #debatenight
Who still believes in trickle-down economics? Because we've seen that show a few times and the ending never gets better. #debates
Tax cuts for the wealthy? From 33% to 15%..... That's nearly half. As an incentive?? This can't be real. #DebateNight #ImWithHer
Law and order wasn't a very good show so I don't think we really need it #Debates
Donald trump cannot control himself. He's acting more like a woman than Hillary smh  #debates
Trump is such a bully... the host is weak. I would've shut his mic off. #debatenight your time is up
Add hackers to the list of people insulted by Trump. Apparently they're all #400 lbs. #sniffle #debatenight
Very against police judge... that sentence was just said by a presidential candidate. #Debates2016
I want law and order   Except the Constitution  That I don't want  -Trump #debates
Things not to admit in a debate: "I haven't given much thought to NATO." #Debates2016
Trump hates strong women and Hillary can hold her own. He hasn't got a chance. Sniff sniff sniff. #Debates2016
#Hillary laughing and smiling; not cool. Head is starting to bob a bit too; or maybe it's just me. #Debates2016
#debatenight #debates Go Hillary tellin Donald to check his facts. "...you can't just say law &amp; order..." 👏🏽Race relations is about way more
Why does he hate America? The US is a 3rd world country. Come on! Just because we don't have gold toilets in our airports? #debatenight
"2 minutes on race."  American politics in a nutshell.  #Debates2016
I can't even ask y'all what the fkk Trump is saying because I can't catch what he's saying because it makes no sense. #debatenight
Key facts - trump has evaded tax, his companies have been sued multiple times, he is all about money &amp;  a Racist #debatenight #Debates2016
Listening to #debatenight on radio. Psychological experiment; is this like Nixon-Kennedy, is he sounding better than he looks?
Trump takes swipe at NY Times: "It was unusual for the @nytimes to be honest." #debatenight
So @realDonaldTrump is advocating for a crackdown on protests as the best way to heal the racial divide? #debatenight #Election2016
Think about how Joanne the Scammer talks, then listen to Trump. The resemblance is uncanny. #DebateNight
#debatenight @realDonaldTrump didn't invite Putin to hack us -- he was joking ... and it was funny, actually.
@anotherFemLib #debatenight "reduced to rubble" relates to generals pounded by political cudgels; doesn't diminish their military acumen
The 2016 presidential debate, where everyone questions how to say Muslims. #debatenight
I understand being anti-trump, but how the fuck can anyone be pro-Hilary. #debatenight
#debatenight #2016debate trump still no plans - only how terrible our country is and how he will make it better. That's his entire platform.
ok, is it just me or has Trump used the same 4-5 arguments the whole debate so far? #Debates
Trump sounds like me trying to bullshit my way through high school debate. "...not for guns judge...bad things...law n order." #debatenight
"We cannot just say law and order, we have to come forward with a plan." #debatenight
"I prepared for this debate and I prepared to be President." @HillaryClinton Drops 🎤 #debatenight #ImWithHer
(Side note: @realDonaldTrump is very proud of many things he hasn't done yet) #Debates2016
@realDonaldTrump's economic plan sounds a lot like @govsambrownback's plan for Kansas. How's that working out? #fail #debatenight
@realDonaldTrump POTUS doesn't "run the country." That's what checks and balances are all about. #highschoolgovernmentclass #debatenight
That "ugh" Trump did just shows his concern for racial issues. #debatenight
Is @realDonaldTrump going for the presidency against President Obama or Secretary Clinton? #ConcentrateOldMan #debates #DebateNight
President Obama doesn't have to prove himself to Trump! Who does thus clown think he is?! 😒 #debatenight
BUT  its hard to keep guns out of criminal hands because  they are being recieved not only through stores but on through theft#Debates
Did the candidates get the rules?? The over talk is annoying! #debatenight
Trump: I'll release my tax returns when Clinton releases her 33 000 deleted emails.  #debates #election2016 #presidentialdebate
Trump doesn't have attack ads because he spends all the $ on spray tans you heard it here first #debatenight
How long, exactly, as a unit of time, is "the last little while"? #debatenight
Sure, @realDonaldTrump has temperament... to use hardworking immigrant families as scapegoats and to incite hate #Debates2016 #1uVote
#Trump been blowing low blows the entire debate. #debatenight #Debates2016 #TrumpVsClinton #trumpclintondebate  Are U Watching? 👀
"I have a winning temperament." -  Donald Trump.  Goodnight, ya'll. I'm done. There is no meaning left in life. #debates
Hopefully this election is like those multiple choice exams where I can select c) none of the above #debatenight
I think running for president makes you a politician to... 🙄 #Debates2016
.@HillaryClinton asked to start next segment: foreign policy. 3rd time Moderator leads with her. Ridiculous. #DebateNight
Prove you are under audit @realDonaldTrump show us evidence of the audit at the least!!! #debatenight
Wipe the server....you mean, with a cloth??  I don't think she was kidding re: her knowledge level #Debates #LetGaryDebate
#debatenight #therealdonaldtrump  All Americans have been let down by politicians for years.
"I HAVE A MUCH BETTER TEMPERAMENT THAN SHE DOES" - Trump   #Debates
Drink every time Trump brings up his businesses/properties to answer a question that has nothing to do with either of those things #debates
How many lines of coke did #Trump do before coming on stage?  #debatenight
Constantly interrupting your opponent and fighting with the moderator and aggressively lying is good temperament. Look it up #Debates
Hey Hillary, we want to see the documents showing the money in &amp; out of the Clinton foundation and how you made your fortune.   #debatenight
This is honestly what I've been waiting for all year. Donald Trump can't do specifics and that's what debates are about. 🤗 | #Debates2016
One thing that's interesting about Hillary's approach is her use of coherent thoughts and sentences #debatenight
Nice job, Hill!  "You criticized me for preparing for the debate, but I also prepared for the presidency."  BUUURRN! 🔥   #debatenight
Not sure Trump knows what the word "temperament" means.    #Debates2016
If yelling loudly made a statement true, @realDonaldTrump would be the straightest arrow alive. #debatenight
Real reason Trump was a #Birther ? Because he's a white supremacist #debatenight
Can somone fact check this for me this is to many stats #debatenight
Trump does try to play the good guy but just can't help the racist embedded in his subconscious #debatenight #USPresidentialDebate
Clinton dropped the ball. Turned race relations into gun control...and made sure to remind us "not all police are bad". #debatenight
Politics makes me so angry... I can't watch this debate any further. #debates
I agree with Trump that there should be Law and Order. I like that show, it has a great music theme. #Debates
He just admitted he's in it for himself, how do you expect him to represent anyone else? #debatenight
The IRS says Trump is perfectly free to release his tax returns.  He still refuses #debatenight
Financially supports the war but then wants to say that he didn't. Okay. Sure. #HypocriticalTrump #StopInterrupting #Debates
This debate is the equivalent to watching toddlers fight over a toy in the playground. #debatenight
these characters just sitting back pointing fingers, shit talking and selling dreams with bullshit lies. #Debates2016 but that's politics
"Stop and frisk was ruled unconstitutional."  "No it wasn't."  smgdh. #Debates2016
I hope this debate has the Born Against/Sick Of It All debate ending. #Debates2016
He's not doing nasty commercials to "save money"? How high road of him. #debatenight
@timmyhale @Evang4Justice what ideas are proposed to support babies? I wanna know that. #debates2016
@timmyhale I think you're the one who said it. look at the thread. #debates2016
Can we get some fact checking on this guy! #DonaldTrump is pulling statistics out his Ass! #LesterHolt is a joke! #debatenight #debates
wonder how the debate would look if hillary hadn't bought out cnn #debatenight
Only 25 minutes into the #debates and @realDonaldTrump is already having a tantrum
"we settled the suit with ZERO admission of guilt" - yeah, that's how most settlements work, your ex wife can confirm #debates
Donald completely ignored the ISIS on American soil question. Such a good opportunity - missed. Sad! #debates
If you had "Braggadociously" on your drinking game card just go ahead and shoot Jack Daniels directly into your veins. #debatenight
My greatest skill-set is contingency and strategic long-term planning. *pours another glass of wine and goes full throttle* #debatenight
"We have endorsements from every police group" any other endorsements you wanna talk about? #Debates2016
"I made a mistake using a private email and would do it differently next time" says Hillary.  What does that mean? #debates
@HillaryClinton is putting more work into not laughing at @realDonaldTrump than I have ever put into anything. #Debates2016 #debatenight
If the moderator was white, do you think he would let them talk? Trump has a great temperament?? What a joke!! #debates
wow "your president" last time i recalled you do live in the united states Mr.Trump #debatenight
Take a drink every time Trump say "Just the other day". #debatenight #Debates2016
"Could be someone on their bed who weighs 400 pounds [who hacked the DNC]" - I guess Trump just lost the hacker vote. #debatenight
"Please just call Sean Hannity, and he'll lie all about it to you!" #debatenight #Debate2016
@LesterHoltNBC is keeping this debate on time as much as Delta keeps my flight on time #debates
True he probably pays zero in income taxes, but his employees due pay. Which accounts for much more than what they paid.   #DebateNight
How to heal the race divide? More "law and order!!" What?! #debatenight #trumpclintondebate
#debates @realDonaldTrump @HillaryClinton Two of the worst possible candidates in our nations history. No plan but to punish We The People!
Tbh I don't think either one of these candidates will help the issue of racism #debatenight
I'm guessing Trump didn't trip or drool tonight so he won? #debatenight
RELEASE YOUR TAX RETURNS @realDonaldTrump  (Also said emails in same sentence). #BINGO #debatenight @ExilesBarDC
Just watching him speak you can tell the hamsters can't spend the wheel fast enough.#debatenight
Okay guys, we need to bring back Law and Order: SVU #debatenight
Lol did @realDonaldTrump call US (top OECD) a third world country by comparing JFK airports with Qatar's #debatenight
No lie Trump seriously "debates" like the 6 year olds at my work arguing on the playground... #debatenight
Trump sez Main Stream Media is in H camp.  Same guys who dont cover her to point camera where Trump might sometime?  #debates #debatenight
"I have a much better temperament than she does!" He said, as spit flew from his mouth and his arms flailed about wildly. #debatenight
Trump on race relations- "Chicago is terrible! I have property there!" #debatenight
MAN I THOUGHT HE WAS ABOUT TO MISSPEAK ABOUT THAT ENDORSEMENT FROM ICE. #DebateNight
How smart people can listen to #Trump speaking and support him baffle me. Rotten by money, he's a clown! #debatenight
how am I supposed to be a young educated voter if the debate goes past my bedtime #debatenight
See he’s grown his wealth tonight from 649 million to 650 million. #Debates2016 #debatenight
@KyungLahCNN @realDonaldTrump  yes including all those “joe the plumbers” that he would screw over #Debates2016 #debatenight
#Debates2016 #DebateNight Listening to Hillary talk about race reminds  me that her husband claimed to be the first black President
So are "illegal immigrants" just walking around killing people?!? Man, STOP!!! #debatenight #Debates2016
A very testy topic rn on race. Not something either can afford to mess up #IDS1252 #debatenight
.@realDonaldTrump "Superpredators" was bad thing to say. So was trying to railroad five innocent men with a full-page ad... #debatenight
If Hillary doesn't get votes, y'all, she's not gonna win. That's it. Hillary, u gotta move the ppl. Get the ppl to vote for u. #debatenight
I will be sitting on Twitter all night waiting for @nick_laning live tweets 😂 #debatenight
"I have a much better temperament" says the man railroading the moderater and yelling wrong into his mic.  #Debates

There we have the first email attack. First of many probably #Debates2016 #Debates #DebateNight
@DonaldTrump says It could also be someone on their bed who weighs 400lbs... is that a #microagression ? #debates
She better speak up and protect her FRIENDS #Debates2016 "when they go LOW we go HIGH!" I'm sold.
@nicolammacleod when someone talks about "the cyber" is that kinda like saying "the Walmart" or "the Costco"? #debatenight
I woke up at 3AM for this #debatenight. I should have known better.
Hillary has Wall Street backing, how will they buy her off? #PresidentialDebate #debates2016
I don't think he realizes that when he says "look at the mess we're in" most people think "trump is the republican nominee" #debatenight
This debate is just too good. Trump is losing it and Hillary is standing her ground. #debatenight
Ugh, I can't listen to any more of this unmitigated crap. They're both THE WORST. #Debates2016
Hey Mr Trump, I like contributing to my community. Why are you proud of not doing that? #debates
The biggest mess ever.  Europe in 1940 was a party.  #debatenight
The third presidential debate should be on HBO and just be a Trial by Combat #Debates
I am SO glad that Jesus is and always will be in control!!! I just can't even #debates
The best part of this debate is not watching it but instead watching all my fav comedians on Twitter #debatenight
"we have to restore trust between comunities and the police" like you believe what you say  #debatenight
Why aren't admiral's and generals coming forward now? Why in the coming weeks? Are they waiting for the checks to clear? #debates
Donald, if no one has informed you, he's YOUR president as well...has been for the last 8yrs. #Debates2016
TRUMP BROUGHT UP HER ADS. Which are only his OWN WORDS.  Trap, stepped in.  #debatenight
Do you notice that Hillary lets Trump talk and he interrupts her every time.  #Debates
"That makes me smart."= a real thing the #republican presidential candidate and/or a supposed grown man actually said out loud #Debates2016
"If your main claim to be POTUS is your businesses, then maybe we should talk about that."  BOOM  #DebateNight #debates #Debates2016
Trump's 10 year old son has our backs on online security, we're all set America. #Debates
Wow @LesterHoltNBC needs to reel this shit in. Answer the question @realDonaldTrump ! #debatenight
OK. Now I'm concerned for anyone playing a drinking game. PLEASE STOP. You'll probably die. #debatenight
Hilary's got to stop using polysyllabic words if she's gonna have any chance of swaying any Trump supporters. #debatenight
Trump to Clinton, describes US president Barack Obama as "your president" #debatenight
"A man that can get provoked by a tweet should not have his fingers anywhere near the nuclear codes" #hillaryclinton #debatenight

"NATO was the worst thing ever," TRUMP. "NATO is something I haven't given a lot of thought to," TRUMP. #DebateNight
#debatenight  Trump: I have a better temperament than her! Audience: LOL
Big government scares me. People who want big government scare me. And it should scare you too. The government is not my parent.#debatenight
Every time Donald opens up his mouth he constantly talks about himself and his many "achievements" #debatenight
#Debates2016 at least Hillary is answering direct questions. Come on Donald: what are your plans?
Yo Clinton is speaking them facts she knows what's up with the justice system #Debates
@realDonaldTrump "I did not support the war in Iraq. I was against the war in Iraq."  Trump is his own biggest enemy. #Debates2016
OMG -- Trump is the gungrabber -- wants to take guns from people, not Hillary. The right is confused. #debates #2A
Trumps logic: It was the 70s. Everybody was 'scriminating. So...you know. #debates #Debates2016
Trump with the slam on fat nerds. Better get Melania on the campaign trail to try and woo them back. #debates #Debates2016
Clinton could stand there smiling the whole time and come out of this on top. #DebateNight
[watching debates] [squirts self in head with stupid iOS 10 squirt gun  🔫]
I'm glad the bottom of the TV says what they are supposed to be talking about because I'm lost #debatenight
@ruthers7 Do you agree that Trump has a better temperament than Clinton? 😳#debatenight
He can't be serious. How in the world did he get here!!! #debatenight
@HillaryClinton is clearly prepared. @realDonaldTrump is floundering like always. Improv isn't your strength here jerkoff. #debatenight
@realDonaldTrump debating like a 13 year old. "I heard that she said that he did something that she thought was..." etc. #debatenight
You can't defeat Isis without sending us into another war zone! This is not what we need right now.  #Debates
Good thing I didn't participate in this drinking game because I'd be blacked #debatenight
So we are a third world nation because of our airports??? 🤔#debatenight #debates
So it's Russia ,China,Hillary, and fat dudes to blame for all the ills we suffer #Debates
I watch this and I'm flabbergasted that ANYONE could vote this this bully gasbag. #nevertrump #Debates2016
Addressing racism with a racist plan. He's a bigot, sexist, blowhard! #Debates2016
This has become so popular of a topic the hashtag got an emoji. #debatenight
@realDonaldTrump, two of the countries you mentioned have a restricted military by conclusions and by terms of surrender #debatenight
Trump bragging about his properties overseas... I bet they loved those jobs! #debatenight
He's been building a relationship with the African American community for AT LEAST the past week. #debates #letgarydebate
Such guilt and idiotic ness from his mouth.. you're on fire @HillaryClinton thank you for being inspiring #ImWithHer #debatenight
How many times has he filed for Bankruptcy? Yeah, he knows about money #debatenight
@HillaryClinton If you can't handle a simple email account you can't handle nuclear weapons. #DebateNight
There is no sch thing as system racism against blacks. There is systemic racism against whites #affirmativeaction #debatenight #trumpwins
Trump with some more anecdotal evidence after being caught in a lie. How can you stand by this fucking idiot?!?! #debatenight
Lester just needs to ask the questions and shit up otherwise. #debatenight
#debatenight @HillaryClinton is not fooling anyone! She is a liar and a sociopath! PRISON FOR HILLARY!
#debatenight Trump admits he said: “Who knows?” when asked by Howard Stern about invading Iraq in 2002
Gonna cry racism Hillary? Gonna play the race card like every single other liberal? #debatenight #CrookedHillary #Trump2016
I have never seen such a biased debate host. This is shameful, 100% bought and paid for by Clinton. #debatenight #Trump2016 #Infowars
Pro tip: watch the #Debates2016 with no sound and choose who to vote for based on how poised and professional they look. 💅🏼
@JayEeeTee you should've came over with a bottle of wine for this  #Debates
"I take advantage of the laws of the nation" translates to "I take advantage of the people of the nation". #debatenight
i'm going to take a leap of fact and say the dynamics of this debate are viscerally familiar for many women watching tonight. #debates
Wasserman Shultz comments were first strong hits of the night. Took him &gt; 1 HR to remind us of her gamesmanship. He looks weak. #debates
Donald wants folks to pay their fair share yet he brags about not paying Federal taxes. SMH #debatenight
This #debatenight makes me want to jump into a DeLorean and be transported to October 21, 2020 😬
If I could ask the presidential candidates one question tonight, it would be "Would there be justice for Harambe?" #debates
Regardless of who wins, these two will be linked forever in history. This is dreadfully amusing. #debatenight
LESTER IS HEATING UP Black man: correcting and mentioning racial profiling White man: Nah, you're wrong  #Debates2016
"Yeah, I started racist rumors about the president. I think I did a good job." - Trump #Debates2016
The big fat ugly bubble is standing across from you Donald!  #Debates2016
.@realDonaldTrump You lie!  #IRS says you CAN release tax returns. Poor you!  Does @IRS have a personal vendetta against you? #debatenight
My strongest asset is my Temperament. I know how to win. She doesn't. - Trump to Clinton. Just Wow #DebateNight
If it weren't a school night I'd be wasted with this #debatenight
Trump's idea of a third world country is a land of Cinnabons and souvenirs, sounds rough. #debatenight
Hillary has done a good job of staying on point. Talking about policies and plans. Trump talking about history. #Debates2016
"A very against police judge." - The Republican Nominee for President of the United States #debates

#debatenight Co-operating does not mean sucking their cock while they export terrorism around the world!
"We need to be cooperating with Muslim nations" @HillaryClinton  There it is folks she'll have women wearing burqas in no time #debatenight
Trump is a gaint man child...I see a tantrum in the near future... #debatenight
He doesn't know anything about what is going on. He is blowing smoke up your butts people!! #debatenight
Really craven for HRC to pander directly to me by saying "woo okay!" and shimmying exactly as I would in that situation #debatenight
It makes you smart that you don't pay Federa Taxes? So what does that make me? Stupid? #debatenight
Thank You Lester!! #debatenight  but Donald Trump said you are WRONG
Hello were you asked a question.?? Your answer right now in my opinion is irrelevant. #debatenight
Secretary Clinton called out Bag Daddy during #debatenight . Tune in next week on @WWE #mondaynightraw for his response! @WWECreative_ish
In grandiosity, sweeping generalization. In resentment, obsessive detail. Between, a wasteland. #Trump #Debates2016
#debates trumps number of people killed in Chicago changed three different times. He has no clue what he is talking about. Bring facts.
Bernie Sanders 😭😭 fuck y'all for wanting fake lying fat to be president she's she's a female  #debatenight
#debatenight #Trump "Police officer being killed very violently" isn't being killed already very violent? You're getting redundant
Trump is kind and gentle when he agrees. He's your passive aggressive wife finding your Twitter account when he doesn't agree. #debatenight
@realDonaldTrump, you supported the #iraqwar. It's on the record. Own it. The end! #debatenight 🇺🇸
BREAKING: Trump plans to name 10 year old Baron Trump as Cybersecurity Czar #debatenight

Bait and Switch.  What does her emails have to do with his taxes? #Debates2016
Somebody get me off Twitter. I am having too much fun with this debate stuff. #Debates2016

We are apparently a third world country because our airports aren't covered in gold leaf according to Herr Drumpf. #debatenight
I need a president that can  fix the economy so people can get there jobs back if it will ever happen between trump or Clinton #debatenight
Yea man if only there way some like, treaty or talks between nations to reduce nukes #debatenight

"Criminal Justice Reform" = letting criminals get away with crime because of their race.  #debates

Awful specific description of that hacker Mr Trump. What else does he know. #debates
It's ashame in the USA these are the two candidates of which one will be president. 2 highly flawed millionaires #Debates2016
I'm so glad that Trump is concerned with President Obama's birth certificate because it shows how much of an idiot he is. #Debates2016
My wrist is going to break if I keep having to make the sarcastic-jerk-off motion #carpaltunnel #debatenight
I just don't understand how any logical person w a brain can listen to this skewed rhetoric &amp; think there's any validity to it #debatenight

I think Lester doesn't want to be dragged like Matt was, but you can tell he's not here for all this Trump nonsense #DebateNight
"i prepared to be president. and i think that's a good thing." 🙌🏼 #debates
Even if Trump running for president . Is just for show he brought out some serious racial issues in this country #debatenight
.@HillaryClinton never interrupting @realDonaldTrump   is that intimidation or a tactic?  #debatenight
#DebatesTrump HRCs's old debates against Obama, "nice now.  that's not the way it works."  that IS how it works...w/ grown-ups.
#Trump is correct that politicians spew bs for the sole purpose of getting votes and then forget about us for the next 4 years #debatenight
When Donald Trump drinks water, I think he drinks Vodka. Perhaps he loves Putin #debatenight
I hope the next segment is the talent portion. You just know that Hillary's doubles are squeaky clean. #debatenight #ImWithHer
Clinton: Trump paid no federal income tax. Trump: "That makes me smart." Me: Hmm...what does that make me?  #debates
Hillary don't shoot yourself in the foot b. You campaigned against Obama sometime and things weren't pretty! #debatenight
Shoutout to all my tax evaders out there, BTW. I salute you. #debatenight
Fact Check: By "small loan" Trump must mean "sizable loan." Also, his father bailed him out from financial disaster in the '90s #DebateNight
It's the oil stupid.  Let's occupy Muslim lands for it. #Debates
Uh, just who do you mean by "these people." These "bad people." ???? Huh Mr. Trump? #debatenight
"Like your president thinks" ???? @realDonaldTrump who the heck is YOUR president??? Such disrespect. #HillaryClinton #Debates2016
If I live stream while live tweeting while the #debates is on live will time &amp; space fold on itself creating the blackhole that stops Trump?
Did Trump just say not paying taxes makes him smart? That makes you a fucking criminal you moron! #debatenight
Why is Hillary blinking so much?  Any psychologists want to chime in?#debatenight
I find it fascinating that they're wearing the colors of the opposing party. Fitting for this poop fest of an election #debatenight
Holy cow, The Sniffing Accountant was also Carl the janitor from The Breakfast Club...that's my takeaway thus far #debatenight
"Who was a very against police judge"-Trump trying to [sentence properly] #Debates2016
I love that Trump just says "No, you're wrong," as if that's the end of the discussion. #debatenight
Ok, so trump didn't even bother to try and defend minorities. He didn't even bother to try to fake it.....#debatenight
#hsgovchat #Debates2016 great @NPR program on "implicit bias" nothing wrong w having a bias it's what you do w it!
Trump is cutting taxes for EVERYBODY, not just the wealthy. along with simplifying our tax code. #debates #debatenight #Debates2016
The DNC rigged the primary for #SickHillary, Bernie took millions from Americans and had no chance. #debatenight #debates #Debates2016
Let me say it for the people in the back "THE USA IS NOT A THIRD WORLD COUNTRY" he doesn't know what that means #debatenight
Trump seems to think Hillary was already president, I mean she was responsible for EVERYTHING WRONG IN THE WORLD #debatenight
Do we have a job problem or a people problem? I'm over here like "Hey! Want a job?", "I'm hiring", "Yeah dude, I'll hire you!" #debatenight
Hillary never said this about police before!!! What brought about this change?!?!?  #Debates2016
"They shouldn't have been in" Iraq and yet Trump supported it. #debatenight "I hope the factcheckers are turning up the volume" says Clinton
completely dodging the emails i care more about hillary's emails than trump's taxes  #debatenight
Did @therealdonald_ just say he was endorsed by ice? Shit, how did he pull that one off? #debatenight
If I was Lester at this point I would just start screaming into the mic every time trump interrupted #debatenight
#DebateNight @realDonaldTrump says "your president thinks" - the last time I checked, he is our President ...
Donald has officially sniffled up the last of his abysmal dignity #debatenight
@HilaryClinton first said cops are bad now wants to work with them to deal with problem #debatenight
nypost: Lester Holt: "Stop and frisk was ruled unconstitutional in New York."  Donald Trump: "No, you're wrong."  #debatenight
POOR LESTER IS ONLY TRYING TO DO HIS JOB. FUCKING LET HIM TALK!!!#debatenight #Debates2016
Instead of talking about themselves they're just talking about eachother ? #debatenight
National security &gt; national debt...IMO, Donald Chump. I don't feel safe with you at the helm...no composure and ignorant. #debatenight
at least we know #trump knows more than 3 countries, he just mentioned Libia  XD #Debates
Donald doesn't even know what he's saying he basically repeated what Clinton said about "not letting use of guns" but disagrees😂  #Debates
Haha all he talks about is how good his bankrupt businesses have done #debatenight
Hit 'em with the facts, Hilary! Disparity in sentencing has been a problem for decades! #debates #debatenight #Debates2016
I'm allowed to say @HillaryClinton is lesser of two evils. It's like choosing to go on vacation between Cleveland or Chernobyl #debatenight
I want to listen to what Hillary is saying, but there's a pouty, orange, entitled toddler to her side who will not stfu 🤗#DebateNight
Anyone that thinks @realDonaldTrump won this debate is a #hack. She mopped d floor with him. This is beyond his depth #Debates2016
I can't watch anymore. @realDonaldTrump isn't able to answer a single question. What a child.  #ImWithHer #debatenight #debates
#Debates2016  @yschowdary99 - Did you see her laugh and shake??  where do they shake like that?? Looks like Hillary has nice experience
Hillary is killing this nerd. and no I do not support either one. But goddamn, this fool getting bodied. rip. #debatenight #debates
Holy fucking shit, he's really talking about them creating ISIS. I'm just fucking baffled. Baffled. This is insanity. #Debates2016
I don't expect for Donald Trump to understand racism when he fails to understand classism which is often synonymous #debatenight
TRUMP is poor. That's why he won't release the taxes. He does not want anyone to know.  #Debates2016
In my Kanye Voice, Donald Trump DGAF about black people. Caring about people is more than a photo-op #debatenight
Trump: My racism is OK because many, many other companies got sued for it too #Debates2016 #debatenight #ImWithHer #StrongerTogether
Trump's method of connecting to particular areas of the country is by mentioning he owns property and investments there.  #debatenight
Trump is SUCH a ridiculous muppet. The muppet in my profile pic with me, is smarter than him. #Numpty #Debates #DebateNight #ImWithHer
They better be paying Lester big bucks to sit through this tom foolery 🙄 #debatenight
Absolutely. The #DNC uses women &amp; minorities for votes but does jack shit for them. #debates
"George W Bush made the decision about troops in Iraq, not Barrack Obama." Tell him Hillary! #debates2016
Is her plan to just keep poking the bear, until the bear loses his mind and vomits a crazy pie? #debatenight
Easy way to take a trip to the hospital: drink everytime Trump says "tremendous" #debatenight
Did Hilary just call Trump a DEADBEAT? #Debates2016 but FACTZ though. ROFLMAO!
so y'all don't want gun control bc it "takes away your rights" but you support stop &amp; frisk policies? irony???? #debatenight
You know what else is braggadocious? Nothing, because it's not a real word...  #DebateNight
@realDonaldTrump  As a teacher if you were my student I'd send you to the office. But you'd want that. Maybe I'd just suffer. #debatenight
I really could only watch like 10 minutes of #debatenight but don't worry about it I HAVE A WINNING TEMPERAMENT.
Lol! "Just join the debate by saying more crazy things." ❤️ #debatenight #HillaryClinton
If Baron Trump's so good at computers, why hasn't he hacked Hillary's emails? #debatenight
Does Trump even know what our current nuclear proliferation policy is?? #debatenight
"I think Donald just criticized me for preparing for this debate...you know what else I prepared for? To be president"-Hillary #BAM #debates
"Japan. A behemoth, selling us cars by the millions." [Tojo shakes head and weeps bitter tear.] #debates2016
Her PLAN on guns could actually work...or at least cut down a great deal of the threat in and out of our country.  #Debates
The stopped more black men in NYC in one year with stop and frisk than who live in NYC. It's a dumbass racist policy #debatenight
To be fair, why would anyone willingly talk to Sean Hannity? #debatenight
A big, fat, ugly bubble sounds mildly misogynistic coming from the Don. #debatenight
.@HillaryClinton using Bill's old tackitic "I'm for your policies but I'd do it different." #Debates2016
"I have a winning temperament" - someone who clearly has a winning temperament  #Debates2016
Hillary gave some fun facts about the process of US troops leaving Iraq. TAKE THAT! TAKE THAT! #debatenight
"These people"... just say the n word and get it over with you asshat #debatenight
Yes, Lester. Don't let this piece of shit dodge this question. #debatenight
@NBCPolitics @NBCNews Blacks live in hell so we should stop paying taxes and file Chap 11 like Trump #Debates2016
Trump just wants to win to say he won. He doesn't care #debatenight
#Debates2016 Unfortunately, Donald Trump voters do not tweet. Vote Gary Johnson. He is a good alternative.
Hillary: all the other presidential candidates released their tax returns.   Yes, but no other candidate deleted 33K emails  #debatenight
Trump said "I have better temperament than Secretary Clinton" 😨..... Dawg.... C'mon son 😒 #debatenight
He wouldn't be Donald Trump if he didn't throw in some gratuitous fat shaming. #debatenight
I feel our country splitting farther and farther apart by the minute. #debatenight
Snide Donald. Is he going to comment on her looks soon? #msnbc #inners #debatenight
Lester: "First person who recites the words to Louie Louie correctly wins." #debatenight
You're right - we desperately need to invest in infrastructure. Paying income tax on your millions would sure help with that. #debates
THANK YOU HRC FOR SAYING THE WORDS "SYSTEMIC RACISM" THANK YOU, SHUT DOWN THE PRISON INDUSTRIAL COMPLEX #debatenight
We've been a debtor nation since the start. Jesus, has @realdonaldtrump NOT listened to @HamiltonMusical yet? #debatenight
Someone let the presidential candidate that "biggly" is not a word #debatenight #Trump
trump is trying to start a dick measuring contest with a woman. lmao #debatenight
Donald will fix everything with all his great "deals" he'll be making 😛😦 ugh #debatenight
Hillary should stay away from certain topics. Bengazi. Bad job  #Debates
Trump: I've been all up in the hood, Hilary. What you know 'bout that?#thismadeupforalltheracistshitisaid #debatenight #debates
Trump's #NLP use: said "failed to get the birth certificate" without breaking from the previous sentence about Kenya.  #debatenight
I don't believe in calling ourselves black and white, I believe in saying God's children. #Debates
How much blaming the press or Clinton  will trump do after this #comeonamerica #debatenight
Literally only got a Twitter so I could live tweet the #debates and see what everyone else has to say.
#Debates IRS says you don't have to wait for audit. Release them NOW
@jimmyfallon when can I come on the show again? Wasn't sniffing in our first interview together #sniff #debatenight
Trump is not the richest person he knows. That's called humility. #debates
Check my tax returns. Give them a big look. Nothing to hide. I've got two big loop holes. #debatenight
Hillary should not be the one saying that Trump is "hiding" info... bad move for a debate #debatenight #Debates2016
Trump..charitable? Ha😂😂 Trump pay taxes? Rt hat makes him smart? 😂 how tf did he even get this far #debatenight
We need a better moderator, but trump will never have someone that he can control#Debates
Trump "stiffs" workers.  Pay your bills you orange schmuck!  #debatenight
You don't make a mistake like that after 30 years in politics #debatenight
I don't know what uses more battery life, #PokemonGO or using social media during these #debates
Yet you'll let our military roll over when provoked and tested by Iran and Russia. #cunt #debates
RT mchaelschaffer: Let's be real, at this point, we're just voting on who gets to be a meme for another four years. #debates …
I made a mistake for a private email I'm not going to make any excuses. #DebateNight #debates2016 #HillaryClinton
Why is Hillary wearing all red? These are the real questions we should be asking #debates
How can we know how tremendous your assets are when you won't release your tax returns? #debatenight
Urban dictionary just got lucky tonight, a new word added into their vocab: #bragodocious #debatenight #TrumpVsHillary
Donald Trump is right about Hillary "Typical politician, all talk, no action". Amen. #DebateNight #Debates #Debates2016
Trump addressing Lester Holt by name a few times, cementing his great relationship with the blacks. #debatenight
My Twitter feed can't keep up with the string of lies coming from this debate  #debatenight #Debates2016 #debates
I'll release my tax return as soon as Obama releases his birth certificate...I mean...#literallyTrump #Debates2016
Lester: How will you bring jobs back?   Trump: My dad gave me money.   #debatenight
@joesegal Nope. Tax cuts haven't created growth in 20 years under republicans or democrats #debatenight
Trump should've answered that cyber security questions with saying Hillary put our state secrets on an unsecured server. #debates
Really, really good answer from @HillaryClinton on implicit bias. We ALL have it. Let's acknowledge it. #debatenight
Mrs Clinton talking about Iran n nukes, talking like a thoughtful leader #debatenight
@realDonaldTrump critique other countries for not paying their fair share but you're good businessman by not paying taxes? #debatenight
@debates. #DebateNight is an insult to the 62% of America that wanted to #LetGaryDebate the real issues. #substance
Love that smile. She is in good humor. Winning #Debates2016 hands down. @HillaryClinton

@HillaryClintonis there facts on your website about your emails and Bengazhi #debatenight

Wow other countries must be laughing at the USA. It's hard to even watch this. I think MTV is producing this circus show. #Debates2016
So race and the plight of marginalized communities are not important to you? You'd like to move on, Donald? Duly noted...#debates

#debatenight@hillaryclinton say "I've been thinking about this for a long time" @realDonaldTrump Says "for how long 30 years" ? @druge
Hillary talking about cyber security? Gurl, you opened up a private server in your bathroom and made the US susceptible.   #DebateNight
Essentially what I'm hearing Trump say is that POC are dangerous #Debates
Tonight is a night history is made. Because tonight, a presidential nominee used the word "bragadocious" during the debate. #debatenight
Did he really just sigh #debatenight, African American offended, oh Republicans don't care.
Trump has gone from "Secretary Clinton" to pointing and saying "her" in less than 80 minutes. He's lost it. #debatenight
Ahhhhhhhh!!!! I have a winning temperament! BEST LINE OF THIS DEBATE!!! OH MY GOD!!!! #Debates2016
#debatenight Trump to Clinton: YOU WERE MEAN TO OBAMA IN '08 PRIMARIES! Clinton: Yeah, so mean I was his Sec of State &amp; he endorses me, duh.

Trump: I'm rich I'm rich I'm smart You're not  I'm rich EMAILS China  Money I'm rich  Hillary: lol k... #DebateNight
Donald bemoans Hispanics and blacks who walk down the street and get shot, unable to reach their jobs as busboys and janitors. #Debates2016
Yeah I'm not going to be watching the #debates. I use to actually enjoy politics and now it just makes me mad.
Do people realize ISIS is NOT just in the Middle East? They are global! Global Network you can't just "take out" #debatenight
The fact that Donald Trump's media team didn't clean up his Twitter to remove contradictions is unfathomable #debatenight
Trump has zero plans for anything and Hillary just wants to get in the White House #CongratulationsAmerica #debatenight
#Debate Drinking Game: 1 shot whenever #DonaldTrump mansplains to @HillaryClinton. You'll be drunk in 2 min #DebateNight #ImWithHer #Debates
If he made 694 million dollars last year, I'm thinking the economy is doing alright for him. #debatenight
#debatenight please make Trump stop talking! Let her talk Trump, we want to know about plans, and she give us plans u give us nonsense!
Fact checkers, can we please find out whether @realDonaldTrump's son weighs 400 pounds or not? Please and thank you #debatenight #debates
Does Trump think insurgencies form like pulling vassal levies in crusader kings? #debatenight
The "worst revival" since the Great Depression? What does that even mean? Coming out of a depression is now a bad thing? #Debates2016
"Illegal" immigrants aren't the cause. Statistics show that immigrants are less likely to commit crime. #DebateNight #Facts #NeverTrump
Donald - You don't know who hacked into the DNC. It could have been Russia. could've been China. could've be me..u don't know. #Debates2016
30 minutes into the debate: Donald Trump has talked the whole time and still hasn't said anything. Sad! #debatenight #CNNRealityCheck
"I say nothing!" - the first fact that Donald Trump has produced tonight. #debatenight
This has to be a movie, it cannot be real America  #Debates
This debate is over! He hasn't completed one sentence, nor verbalized a single policy. She was cool as ice. #HRC #ImWithHer #debatenight
So you fly internationally, and the airports are great, thus we are a third world country, so we don't need to see your taxes? #DebateNight

Zing! "I will release my tax returns when she releases her emails"  #Debates

#debatenight is wrapping up. Who won? Stay with CBSN to see what voters like you thought. @FrankLuntz + focus group = standing by #CBSNreax
How many bumps did The Donald do before this debate you think? #debates #debatenight
the last time i heard someone had "foreign weapons" to use a good time was had by all that night (winky winky) #debates #debatenight
Donald trump has been asked to apologize for and own up to his life's works. Bankrupting America ain't a good look #Debates2016
Hillary had an opportunity with DJT 'isis all your adult life.' That's comically non-factual #debatenight
@realDonaldTrump we need to do cyber better? cyber what? what kind of kink are you into? #Debates2016
Come on Donald, stop embarrassing yourself. Answer a freaking question. Just one, I dare you! #debatenight

I have a tremendous income (but I don't pay a cent of federal income taxes because I'm smart) - Trump  #Debates
Moderator @LesterHoltNBC notes that "stop and frisk" ruled unconstitutional. #Trump says judge was "anti-police." #debatenight
Now he's going to mansplain to #Hillary that 500 murders is a lot. #debates
Wrong. Wrong. Wrong. Wrong. My temperament is good. My temperament is good. My temperament is good. My temperament is good. #debatenight
Ok....subject is now race.  Time for some good old-fashioned whitesplaining. #debates
HRC speaking beautifully to the issues tonight. Particularly liking this segment on race issues. #debatenight #ImWithHer
i can feel my braincells dying as i'm listening to donald trump speak #debatenight
So he didn't pay any taxes because they would be, according to him, squandered??? #Debates
Next up on #debatenight, #cyberwarfare. This should be something #HillaryClinton knows all about. 😳
If Trump's 10 year old son is so good with computers maybe we should look into him about the hacking. #debates #Debates2016
"I think implicit bias is a problem for everyone, not just police" yesssss #debatenight
I love how HRC is discussing the systematic issues facing people of color however...she's hedging at the same time. #DebateNight
At what point during the debate does Trump need to go return some videotapes? #debates
Dear Trump, thinking you are above paying taxes doesn't "make you smart" it makes you a shitty American #debatenight
It appears to me that Holt is giving more talking time after the 2min. clock ends to HRC. .@KellyannePolls #debatenight
Soak this in people, this election will be something our great grandchild will read about in history books. #DebateNight
Tonight, I will go to bed dreaming of all the #Hillary gifs we'll all have tomorrow. #DebateNight #Debates2016 #Debates
Hillary is literally reading him for filth. Trump wouldn't know foreign policy from a hole in the wall. #debatenight
Very very tough. Really really great. This is yuge. I am really really winning. - 5-year-old or @realDonaldTrump? #debatenight
Over 4000 people shot and killed in Chicago since Barack Obama has been president. Thanks Obama. You're Welcome Colin Kaepernick.  #Debates
Maybe if Trump had paid taxes our roads would be good…just saying #debatenight
Donald Trump has learned the word "cavalier" tonight and he likes it. #debatenight
Did he just criticise Obama for spending time on a golf course? Or did I hit my head? #debatenight
When he was in Philly. He never went in the hood. #debatenight #trumpislying
Clinton: Trump treated Obama disrespectfully with birther drive. Trump: Clinton treated Obama terribly during presidential debates. #debates
"We pay a lot of many to protect other people" Donald Trump, neighborhood shakedown expert. #debatenight
Can we get @KyleClark @BrandonRittiman as the moderators for the next #debatenight ? Maybe even get @GovGaryJohnson on the stage to debate.
Woo ok says Clinton after Trump rant that he's got a better temperament. Also said go ask Hannity, I was against the war! #debatenight
You're audited all the time because you're a crook and a cheat. #debatenight

Does anyone else want to see Lin-Manuel Miranda and Harvey Fierstein rap this debate? #Debates2016
To be fair to Trump, there's so good answer for him to give on the birther issue, so he might as well word-vomit. #Debates2016
#debates oh gross audience cheering for Trump abt Hillary emails. So dumb. #DebateNight
Trumps law and order and community relations message is way more coherent than Hillary's gun control message.  #Debates2016
There isn't a "basket of deplorables". There's only two deplorables. And we are listening to them.  #debatenight
Trump denies he was for the war in Iraq. Holt says the records show otherwise. #Debates2016
Did he just admit to dodging taxes and then pat himself on the back for it?? #debates2016
Hillary's responses: calculated, intelligent, specific, calm, patient  The Donald's responses: NUH-UH!!    #debates2016
The black people Donald Trump speaks to are the ones he is trying to get to continue not to vote. #Debates2016
I am stressed. #debatenight I want to turn the channel but I can't.
#debatenight Mr. Trump everyone doesn't share your view about on releasing your tax returns.
An hour and 23 minutes in #debatenight &amp; I'm still patiently waiting 4 @LesterHoltNBC to say, "LIVE FROM NEW YORK, THIS IS SATURDAY NIGHT!"

#debatenight "He's so good with these computers. It's unbelievable." Buhleave me, you really need an education to do that shit.

Trump brings in the email controversy, but doesn't seem to bother Clinton. Good save "secretary". #debatenight
#debatenight Stop and frisk is bullshit for racial profiling. Trump is a blatant racist. #dollhandsdonny
#debatenight You are NOT a business person. You are a con man.
Why is the audience allowed to cheer for Hillary but not for Trump? #debatenight
If .@LesterHoltNBC is going to ask .@realDonaldTrump  about his taxes then he better .@HillaryClinton  about her emails. #debatenight
We already have law and order Donald. Oh and nice to draw your investments into this #Debates2016 #debatenight #TrumpLies
Another #TrumpLies Bush got us into the ME and Bush made he deal that Obama withheld! #Debates2016 #debatenight
@realDonaldTrump give us a real plan not ridiculous superlatives and get facts straight #DebateNight  #Debates2016  #ImWithHer
The birth certificate thing was Hillary Clinton's thing the first time she ran for president so why doesn't she own up to it #Debates
Moderator @LesterHoltNBC moves towards the next segment focusing on race relations.  #debatenight
No guns for watchlist should be common sense for both parties #debatenight #debate
i cannot believe that i just heard Hillary talk for a full two minutes without 💩 interrupting her #Debates2016
Omg both candidates agree that people on the no fly list shouldn't have guns.  Pass a law already #debatenight
Hillary pandering to middle class is laughable, DO NOT BE FOOLED poeple. #Debates2016
You can't just go in after a war and steal oil, Donald... #DebateNight
I mean at least she's admitting it's a mistake I guess #DebateNight
the whole two minutes was him saying the words law, order &amp; thousand. not one intelligent sentence leaves his crusty mouth #debatenight
Law &amp; order? Shitbird is on that right now...give me a fuckin break. Now our cities are war torn &amp; lawless? Quoting #falseStatistic #Debates
Lester Holt: "Stop and frisk was ruled unconstitutional in New York."  Donald Trump: "No, you're wrong."  #debatenight
We don't know ALL of Trumps dealings, but what about the emails you deleted Hillary? What was that about? #Debates
Okay Hilary coined the term super predator. We gonna pretend that what Trump says about Mexicans is any better? #Debates
So funny to see "What's happening?" before posting a tweet and not know how to answer #debatenight
#Debates2016 So apparently Homosexuals roam the streets that are illegally here and they shoot people.  I'm done..
I don't know why I expected more from @LesterHoltNBC. There's definitely a bias! #DebateNight #Debates2016
Trump obviously prepped for the #Debates by watching his fave show: Law and Order. Did you miss that? Law and Order.
She is trying so hard no laugh at this clown.   #debatenight
#debatenight Reganomics didn't work. FACT.  Trickle down economics didn't create work or wealth for the middle class.  FACT.
#debatenight how, Donald,  how?  There is no plan.  Just conjecture and bullshit.
Donald Trump needs to chill. I got audited last year as well. Just do the right thing #debates
I'm wondering to myself why I chose to watch this alone. Why am I not at a watch party? #debates
Lol. Over the last little while.  How fucking long is that Donnie?  #HILLARY #POTUS #debatenight
The African American community has been let down by politicians. - Trump #debatenight
I saw less finger pointing in my preschool's rendition of "who stole the cookie from the cookie jar". #debatenight
Trump said the non-word "bigly" 2x in 10 secs, which means he had a chance to use a different word, and did not. That is all. #debatenight
ISIS bad. Jobs good. They both call him "Donald."  At least they can agree on some things. #debatenight
Did trump just compare our airports to third world countries? What is going on? I'm so lost. #debatenight
Don't bring up Obama's birth certificate! This debate is about the future!!! #DebateNight #debate2016
Ooooh! 💡The Jedi Mind Trick! Just tell people "I'm nice." "People like me." "I like minorities." #debatenight #DonaldLikesStarWars
I swear...i knew this was gonna be good...but not THIS good!! #debatenight #Debates2016
I can't believe this is what our country has come to #debatenight
Lester coming like a college professor who knows a student is lying but gonna let him hang himself. #debatenight #Debates
#debates 'member when Hillary acted like violent crimes aren't on the rise this year?
Ah, yes, the politicians are behind shootings in America. Thanks for the enlightenment. #debates
Trump on cyber security in December --- "the government should shut off the Internet" #debatenight
Trump comparing the US to 3rd world countries because our airports look old trivializes real issues like hunger and poverty #Debates2016
Hillary is a fucking queen for literally LAUGHING at Trump while he talks. #Debates2016
Aren't roads and bridges under the purview of city management for the most part? #debatenight
Walking thru my apt complex &amp; ppl are in their living rooms yelling &amp; cursing at their TVs. Don't know it's because of #Debates2016 or #MNF
Donald Trump is seriously rooting for Imperialism. He supports invading countries and seizing their natural resources. Unreal. #debatenight
For God's sake just let her talk 😠 it's like they told him three facts and he's just going to repeat them at top volume all night #debates
#Trump who pays zero taxes is very concerned that others "pay their fair share" #debates
Oh, Donald, honey, don't they say we shouldn't take these kinds of things personally? #debates
He's not answering Lester's question, is he? Or have I had too much vodka already? (joking. I don't drink vodka) "law and order" #debates
@TheGamerAuthor I am seriously giggling here. WTF - is this real? #AmericanHorrorStory aka #Debates2016
Holt with the mad fact check, re: Trump's unreleased audit. About time. #debatenight
Hillary is a very polished politician who talks great and them sells you down the river  #debates
Did Trump just say he opened a club in Palm Beach and we should praise him because he doesn't stop people of color at the door? #debatenight
"We should have taken the oil." Make America a war criminal again! #debatenight
She meant to insert "killed" on the list of things more likely to happen to African American men than white men #debatenight #Debates2016
my mom is mad at me because I keep humming the Law &amp; Order theme song whenever Trump mentions it #debatenight
How trump is attacking hill about the emails is foreshadowing the #OctoberSurprise me thinks #debatenight
"You have to have stop and frisk"- @realDonaldTrump he's gonna lead us to a military state #Debates2016 #debatenight
Don't forget the war on drugs that was lost years ago after trillions spent. Dump it #Debates
I said I wouldn't waste my time watching this, but....  #debatenight
@realDonaldTrump: Patty Doyle failed to get the birth certificate that had already been produced before. #objectpermanence #debates
This new #debates show is very entertaining! Wait, this is a real debate? So sad for us and the US.
Donald breaking he always got to get the last word never let no one talk but i see he a big russia fan russia this russia that #debatenight
@realDonaldTrump is winding up to trying to say #LGBTQ without sounding like he's picking a vowel on the wheel #Debates2016 #LyingDonald
I really hope this man trump don't try one of these other countries if he get elected #debatenight
"Race remains a significant challenge in our country... race defines too much." @HillaryClinton #debatenight #ImWithHer #TrumpTrain
Yellen has big shoes to fill and so far has done a fine job. #debatenight
Did he say, nobody called Sean Hannity....how many times is he going to reference @seanhannity #debatenight
Nothing bad has ever happened from ill preparation, empty promaces and fluffed up words, not at all certainly not #Brexit #debatenight
'I was preparing to be President' boom and good night Mr Trump #debatenight #Debates2016
Who is talking more with their hands, Hilary or Trump?  #debatenight
Trump just asked for and claimed credit for opening a no-discrimination golf club in Florida. #OnlyInAmerica #Debates
"Could just be someone sitting in their bed weighing 400 lbs."  OOOOOO, just lost the coder/gamer vote #debatenight
Bump that... How do you answer a question you didn't hear? #debatenight
I'm no Shillary fan but she should just NOT talk and let him bury himself   #Debates
So far "big league" and "bragadocious" top my list of most presidential terms used during this debate #DebateNight
Hilary says that NYC is safer under De Blasio. That is false, I am more cautious of walking around now than years ago. #cbs #debatenight
Someone get this man a dictionary - he doesn't know what "temperament" means. #Debates2016
What America needs is someone to go after #DonaldTrump returns as much as he was pressing for Obama's birth certificate. #debatenight
do either of them know what daesh does/is or are they just blabbing for shock value #debates
How do you heal the racial divide when you're blatantly racist? #debatenight
#debates Drink, can't believe it took this long to get to the emails topic.
Hillary to Trump: "Join the debate by saying more crazy things." Audience laughs. #Debates2016
Why Hillary look like the character from @ChuckECheeses that would turn his head stiffly every 5 min. #debatenight
Ah, Donald bragging about his temperament again.... Yet he gets #triggered so easily. #debatenight
Well, Von Trump, if you both settle and admit guilt, you're an idiot. Basic law. Still a racist. #debatenight
Pennsylvania Avenue...if I don't get there one way, I'll get there another! Is this man for real?!  #debates
*turns on #debatenight driving home from awful job* *listens for 30 secs* *pulls over, tear in eye* *freebases high blood pressure meds*
Does he not understand that she is also rich, and not because of a daddy-loan? #Debates2016
A little fat shaming, for good measure. Just keep talking, buddy. #Debates2016
This asshole up here talking about Law and Order. GET THE FUCK OFF STAGE #DebateNight
#debatenight only in the first segment, and Trump is already making me feel physically sick. Please US, don't let this happen any longer...
yes a law is unconstitutional only if it doesn't work, never mind the infringement on civil liberties #Debates
THERE IS NO DUE PROCESS FOR THE NO FLY LIST, IT SHOULD DICTATE OUR RIGHTS #debates
Trump's idea of diplomacy is "They will do it." How? "I will make them." #Debates2016
in what world does america fall under the category of "third world" #debatenight
There's a reason they love Trump so much... they can't control themselves either. #debatenight
Gangs are not made up of illegal immigrants. That is just stupid. #debatenight
Why doesn't the wealthy that want to pay more taxes just donate to the IRS? #Debates2016
Has he said "yes or no" to if he supports it yet????????? #DebateNight
Seriously worried the protest voters are going to fuck us in November #DebateNight #Election2016
So his answer to the question is "I have a better judgement than her.I have a better temperament.' #debatenight
Remember when Trump bought a full page ad calling for execution of 5 innocent black teens? Imagine this guy running the country #debatenight
I built an unbelievable co. Paid no taxes. Our infrastructure is like a third world country and Hillary should be blamed. #debatenight
Can't wait to see the I have a great temperament and the 400 pound man on the bed memes tomorrow #debatenight
What judge? #debatenight I'm actually serious. What judge? Who's the judge? What's his/her name?
Does Trump have a plan to stop ISIS? Like. I don't think I've ever heard of a plan about that from him. #debatenight
Bush got us into Iraq. What the hell is he talking about? #debatenight
Better judgement: Birther movement, mass deportation of innocent people, multiple lawsuits, wants to just nuke our enemies. #debatenight
#debatenight New drinking game! Every time you hear China or Russia from Trump's mouth take a drink.
Every question is an attack on Trump to corner him. Hilary is lobbed soft balls. #debates
This #debatenight  is getting really lame. Attack Trump, Trump is a racist. Muh blacks..When is Hitler making his appearance?
#debates  Blowing another navy out of the water would not start a war???  Has he ever read ANY history?  the man is so stupid!
Im pretty sure our airports are not an indicator of third world status. #debatenight #debates
So you admit that you will take inept people over people who can do their job..??? #debatenight #debate

Trump is going to use words like "the blacks" "thugs" and other dog whistles to the alt-right #Debates2016 #sgdebatewatch
Hillary's smile as Trump is pressed on his tax returns is fuel for my soul. #debatenight
Fuck. Another hour? I feel like they really haven't gotten anywhere.  #debatenight
. @realDonaldTrump just promised to release his tax returns if @HillaryClinton releases her 33k deleted emails #debates #debatenight
This must be the 1st time a prez candidate has referred to "an interview I did with Howard Stern" at a presidential #debate. #debatenight
Cities Black ppl live in according to Trump: Detroit and Philadelphia #debatenight
Hillary is saying how unfair it is to not pay people but she has no problem with taxes which is legal theft. #Debates #debatenight
"It's all words" is actually a fair description of Donald Trump right now #Debates
Using the 5th to protect yourself from legal inquiry-Bad / Using bankruptcy and the housing crash to profit personally -Smart? #debatenight
Clinton is an attorney. She knows how to bait and emotional, angry person in to saying stupid things. She's doing it well #Debates2016
Overall 62.3% negative sentiment assessed by algorithms analyzing Facebook and Twitter posts within #debatenight.

@IngrahamAngle #HofstraDebate , Does MRS Clinton not remember her debates against President Obama??
U can still release ur taxes even while under audit Donny boy  #debates
Trump's interjections sound like he's doing backup vocals to Hillary's rap #debates
My entire life has led up to watching this centipede end Hillary Clinton's career on live TV. 🐛🐛🐛🐛🐛#debatenight
The cyber security probably wasn't the best point for her to bring up. Plenty of people were happy for the DNC leaks. #debatenight
#debates "A man who can be provoked by tweets shouldn't have his hands anywhere near the nuclear codes." -Hilary
STOP AND FRISK IS UNCONSTITUTIONAL. STOP AND FRISK IS NOT OKAY #DebateNight #BlackLivesMatter

Maybe we can't afford infrastructure because you don't pay your fair share of federal taxes. Mic drop. #debatenight
It could've been Russia, some bored fat dude in a bed in Peoria that I hired. Maybe it was my 10-yr old son. Who knows? #debatenight
Who had better Low Blows @ each other   Trump:"No wonder you've been fighting ISIS your entire adult life."#Debates2016 #debatenight #DHG310

#debatenight there's no question. Hilary it is!!! You go girl!!! Tell that fucker to back off #HillaryClinton
Come on @HillaryClinton, say that race determines if you get into a Trump building! #debatenight
Hillary would have had it lit if she said shot &amp; killed by white police officers ... #debatenight
I think Donald is running so mid sentence he can just tell us all where he has property &amp; investments. #Debates2016 #ImWithHer
Now he just sounds like he is doing lines of coke with the prolonged sniffing. 🙄🙄🙄🙄 #debatenight
Trump was against the war in Iraq, but for the race war in America. #PresidentialDebate #Debates2016
Legit have not tweeted in months but I'm breaking that tonight bc I'm just in disbelief that this is real life #debatenight
Lester wants to see your foreign debts ya stupid dick...gives no shits about your income. #Debates2016
So this country is bad because our airports aren't up to par not because people are getting shot dead in the street Oh ok #debatenight
HOW ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT DISRESPECT when EVERYTHING out of your mouth is despicable and aggressive. Filthy hypocrite.  #debatenight
Trump acts like he's running for an middle school presidential election! #Debates2016 #ImWithHer #SheWon
So you want to take the national product of a free country? Yea..ok,that would work *eyeroll* #debatenight #debates #debate
Who the hell truly believes you become a billionaire by making your living stiffing people. That's so stupid! #debatenight
Hilary is calling out racism. She is calling out systems. That's what we need. #debatenight #saintselectionu
Cyber security can start when politicians stop setting up illegal servers, or giving staff access to secret email. @AJDelgado13 #debatenight
I have a bad feeling that fighting ISIS online also means losing freedom of speech on the Interest for the States #Debates
"You don't learn a lot from tax returns." .......except about how much ya pay in taxes #debatenight
"Stop and frisk has had a tremendous impact on crime in NYC" yes, in the Up direction #debatenight #stopandfrisk
Trump is looking more and more like a fool every time he opens his mouth #debatenight
What is disgraceful is that @realDonaldTrump still owes many small business owners from his bad dealings. #Debates2016
When Bill C was president we got summer checks. Am I the only afraid that we would get or tax returns from @realDonaldTrump? #Debates2016
He only loves a city if he has investments in it? #debatenight
"No wonder you have been fighting ISIS your entire adult life." Um...what? #debatenight
Did she just say that "EVERYONE should respect the law" ?!?!? what an interesting idea... #debatenight
Trump has groaned, serial sniffed, and harrumphed all night.  Somewhere, Howard Dean is baffled. #Debates2016 #DebateNight
Is this a debate or the worst late night infomercial for Trump Inc. #Debates2016
Why is Lester letting Donald steamroll him...dude betta grow a pair #debatenight #debates
That's not a compliment 2 have the endorsements of police! Your racist undertones are very loud Donald #debatenight #Debates2016 #CNNDebate
They remind me of a bickering married couple. And that makes me uncomfortable. #debates #debatenight
Trump argues with Clinton, the moderator, the cameraman and all they mamas but he has a better temperament than Hilary #debatenight #rtnrny
HRC says cybersecurity will be one of the greatest challenges facing the next president. #debatenight

More minority men are the subject of stop and frisk because more minority men commit crimes. Per the FBI. #debatenight
I'm guessing the last time Trump took a commercial flight was circa 1982 #debatenight
#debatenight Clmate change is actually the number one threat to both America and the world. Not nuclear war.
Here's how you heal the bitter race divide in America: give African Americans their reparations. The end. #debatenight #debate
Now @realDonaldTrump is shaming @HillaryClinton for "disrespecting" her opponent @BarackObama by debating him in 2008. #debatenight
Let's not let the words of 2 ppl be more meaningful than the words/actions BILLIONS of us devote our lives to every day. #DebateNight
This is like watching a parent trying to reason with their 3 yo throwing a tantrum in public. #debatenight

This should come w/ a slider, like the 3D glasses we used 2 get.  You could just slide and cover your candidate of choice.  #debatenight
I cared so much about the last debate and I took a nap through this one😂 #debatenight
If Trump were really a New Yorker, he'd know that Law &amp; Order is alive and well.  #debatenight
Sean Hannity is clearly lonely and asked Trump to get women to call him. #debatenight
Next time we look for a puppy I am not bothering with gentle or friendly because only a WINNING temperament will do #debatenight
LOL DONALD YOU WENT TO 3 CHURCHES, AND NOW YOU THINK YOU HAVE A RELATIONSHIP WITH THE BLACK PEOPLE? #debates
Awww, she studied up to be President. Well then she deserves it right? So cute. Give her a trophy. #debates
Woah he just called Obama "your president" I thought we're supposed to be the United States of America #debatenight
Trump telling how much he makes .. hwo stupid and arrogant is that #debatenight
👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼 RT @HuffingtonPost: Clinton: "I prepared to be president. And I think that's a good thing." #debates
Shorter Donald Trump: It's all about me, my family and my businesses. #debatenight
#Trump is in control, the more he talks the merkier things get, the more his people believe in him #debatenight
It sounds like @realDonaldTrump is playing the whose the most humble game. He's the best, winning, has a good brain.  #debatenight
Before the end of the night #Trump plans to blame the entire history of the US on #Hillary #debatenight
My Ma In Law - "just cleaned my oven to within a inch of its life just in case I have to put my head in it after the debate !" #debatenight
i'm getting my ass on the next plane to america to punch trump in the face #debates
Trump repeating the grand statements over and over not explaining any of his plans yet again... #debatenight
"Charlotte.  A city I love.  I city where I have investments."  I'm sorry.  That should say it all.  #debatenight #debates
Use force only when necessary. I have called for reform of the criminal justice system: @HillaryClinton on US shootings #Debates2016
take a shot every time a white man speaks over a woman because he's threatened by her #debatenight
"I have better judgement and better temperament than she does."   2+2=5   #Debates2016
it really sucks women are willing to vote for someone who won't even let the woman on stage get one word out ): #Debates2016
@realDonaldTrump: "I did a good job getting Obama's birth certificate" what a great thing to boast about #debatenight
Did Donald answer the question or did he basically blamed the black and hispanic for the problems going on? #debatenight
It's like he's telling a fairytale about those really bad poor people who keep shooting each other. #debatenight #Debates2016
#HillaryClinton just bought another million-dollar mansion next to her current one. Nothing her secret bank speeches can't buy. #Debates
Is there an actual reason Lester Holt isn't speaking up here?.. #debatenight
#debatenight Hillary is just giving Trump tons of opportunity to clarify and he's making the most of it!
No @realDonaldTrump, your Holier than thou act in the Detroit Black church didnt work! #debatenight
We don't work with NATO, the USA just pretends to get NATO's approval before we go destroy shit. #Debates2016
😂 "you've been fighting isis your whole adult life" Trump is like a 5 year old  #Debates
Oh yes!!!! @HillaryClinton "Yes I did prepare for this debate. And you know what else I prepared for? Being president." #debatenight
Sweet holy jesus, what is this? This isn't politics by any credible standard. #debatenight
I can't wait for the Bad Lip Reading video of this debate. @BadLipReading #debatenight
Lester Holt is killing it! Call @realDonaldTrump on this racist garbage. Obama comes from a very old family #debatenight
Trump talking on Japan. Japan is incapable of defending itself! We dismantled their military after WWII . #debatenight
Clinton: broad based inclusive growth is what we need not more advantages for people at the top #debatenight
Clinton: Hoping that within a year we will push ISIS out of Iraq and squeeze them in Syria #debates #debatenight
Donald you are not allowed to tell anybody about paying fair shares.  Show me your taxes first! #debatenight
Appreciate Howard Stern but man, not the cite I'd be using.  #debatenight
Did he really say that Clinton has been fighting Isis her entire life. #Debates2016
#debatenight Where's the important topics? Clinton can't stand on the issues, trying to argue in the weeds. @realDonaldTrump Attack!
Donald is like the fucking guy who talks during the damn movie. #Debates2016
Tell that smug bitch how it is! Hold her and Barry Obams accountable! About time! #debatenight #noleadership
We used, certain laws, that are there ... Donald Trump everybody!!! #Debates
How did Hillary keep from busting a gut when #Trump says he's got a better temperament ? #debatenight
WHAT is @realDonaldTrump rambling about on the Sean Hannity front? This is insane. Winning temperament?? #debatenight
"maybe he didn't do a good job" ARE YOU KIDDING ME YOU OLD BAG OF ROTTEN CHEETOS #Debates
I've combined a couple #debatenight drinking games to see how much alcohol I'd consume if I were drinking. Currently at ~21 sips
The fact that Trump cuts Lester off every time he asks a question goes to show that he has no respect for people #debatenight
"Why not?" Did he just admit he will say whatever it takes, true or not?? #debatenight
I opened up a club. #debatenight #trumpclintondebate How is that a defense for race relations ?
Clinton: His taxes may have the answer to the ending of Inception.... we need to know. #debatenight #Debates2016
I find it funny Clinton says Trump owes us answers and is hiding things, yeah she's never done anything like that. #debatenight
This debate is really bad.  I don't know that anything of substance has really been said at all.... #Debates2016
Lester Holt is currently cosplaying as a campus chipmunk. Sneak back to the bushes, little one #Debates2016
Interrupting with "wrong" on things that are easily verified isn't really a viable strategy. #debatenight
"They have all these 'fact checking' sessions after presidential debates...why don't candidates just say the facts?" - Gma, who is wise
New expressions to add to the global dictionary: 'take the fifth' and 'Trumped up economics'.  #DebateNight
"I prepared for this debate. You know what I else I prepared for? Being president" Hillary Clinton — watching Presidential Debates 2016
Interest rates are too low, and that's Clinton's fault? This is a problem? Is he a moron, too? Apologies to morons everywhere. #Debates2016
When I think of how beautiful our current president @BarackObama &amp; his family is, &amp; that Trump is even in consideration? #amJoy #debatenight
Will everyone please take a huge bong hit every time Trump takes a creepy sip of water? #debates2016
@Jimmytheworm Guys, I was talking about my actual son. That's why I didn't hashtag #debatenight
Interesting debate strategy. Just say wrong, wrong, wrong over and over. Winning the 4 year old vote. #debatenight
#debates HILLARY-RELEASED 40 YRS POLITICALLY CORRECTED TAX RETURNS, HILLARY'S BILLIONAIRE DONORS PAY TAXES EITHER-money went in her pocket
Trumps not even denying all the crazy shit Hillary is saying about him. #debatenight
Trump ASK Russia to hack the DNC. How has this not come up? #debatenight
Not sure how much of this debate I can watch before throwing my laptop across the room... #debatenight
if he can't even listen to a debate moderator he is not going to listen to the American people #debatenight
I recall Hillary sold uranium to Russia... hmmm. Pot, meet kettle. #debatenight
Tax cuts for big business = more money in the 1%'s pockets. They've no interest in helping the middle class grow. #Debates2016
We're getting hacked because we're using terribly outdated technology. The decision makers are techno-clueless. #Debates2016
I think Trump just claimed Clinton was the assistant manager to the Middle East. #debatenight
If this debate does not wake America up, I'm not sure what will #debatenight #Debates2016
Will someone call Sean Hannity? Just to make sure he's doing ok. I feel bad. #debatenight
Trump doesn't care about black lives.  Not one shit is given. #debatenight
“We need law and order! Except for the constitutional rights of minorities.” - @realDonaldTrump. Lovely. #debatenight
I take comfort in the fact that the most intelligent, intellectual people I know view Trump as an abrasive buffoon #debatenight
Trump 7 Hillary 5* 2nd Quarter, 11:42  *has ball  #debatenight
Damnnn did Trump just say his financial statement is $694 million what he made?! #debatenight
They asked him about race relations and discussed Barack Obama's birth certificate and continuing his racist brither campaign #debatenight
Ohhh Trump out here supporting Bernie Sanders #debatenight oh and blame Obama for America losing the Internet....
Who do i have to tweet for your fact check #trump?  This sounds like a drunken argument with an underage drinker #Debates2016
Trump has to know that the black community doesn't like him.   He has to know we don't rock with him.   Someone inform him.  #debatenight
Checking to see if you're following up on the Debate, BOOM there you're. @obiomalove1 #DebateNight @HilaryClington
Are we sure these 30k emails aren't just spam? Cause I think I've deleted that many... #debatenight
My plan at work tomorrow: Tell everyone how great I am and all my "bigly" accomplishments, expect them to anoint me CEO #DebateNight
That would not start a war?!? Yeah, Pearl Harbor didn't bring us to war either. #debatenight
When Hillary talks about racial issues AND FORGETS ABOUT HOW SHE KICKED BLM OUT OF ONE OF HER PRIVATE FUNDRAISERS. #debates #ItsAScam
and Clinton owned him by bringing up his taxes again. Excellent timing!  #Debates #Debates2016 #DebateNight #Neohuman @HillaryClinton
"lol if i dont get to be president i'll still be on the same road."  #debatenight
How about talking about stuff I care about, like if I'll be able to retire at some point later or if I can ever afford college? #DebateNight
I'm seeing a running joke throughout this whole debate "Mr.Trump you have two minutes" #debatenight
Donald Trump was the racist who forced our president to ask for his birth certificate. He created #birther lie. Shame on him. #debates
#DebateNight Trump just blusters and rants "Beeelieve MEEE". Why would anyone do that? He lies as sport. And is only in anything for himself
What kind of exercises does trump do to sustain duckface for so long #drunktweetthedebates #debatenight #Debates2016 #PresidentialDebate
Going into the Middle East created the vacuum that created ISIS, so let's go back in and do it all over again #TrumpLogic #debatenight
Being sued for racial discrimination is just one of those things #trump #Imwithher #debates2016
"I don't know, maybe, who knows!" - Trump quoting himself and using only the best #debatenight
I wonder if @realDonaldTrump knows temperament isn't the same thing as having a temper? #debatenight
And now he's criticizing her for disrespecting someone? DO YOU LOOK IN THE MIRROR? #debatenight
There goes @realDonaldTrump being @realDonaldTrump ! Absolutely NO presidential temperament. You favored the war...PERIOD! #debatenight
Did clinton just infer that Trump lobbied to have Gaddafi killed for him? #debatenight
Would you support the development of additional national parks or wildlife refuges? Where would they be located? #debatenight
For the record, I sent all the presidential candidates these questions early during the primaries. None provided any answers. #debatenight
@HillaryClinton has been owning @realDonaldTrump since the beginning of debate. She's a beast! 😂 #Debates2016
Donald Trump needs to stop talking about money and focus on the debate. He is unfit to be president . #DebateNight
Spending my  #debatenight in class hopefully my teacher puts it on
Did Trump just say he has a better temperament than Mrs. Clinton. #debatenight
"essentially financial statement of sorts" oh. what about your tax returns? #debatenight
Remember when all those folks started getting locked up? Yep. Under Bill Clintons presidency, sunshine. #debatenight #Debates2016
Say what you will, #Trump is speaking from his heart unlike #Hillary who sounds like she's reading a script. #debatenight #Debates2016
This debate is so far behind schedule they're gonna run into the 2020 debates
Everyone's talking about Trump and Clinton but I'm just thinking about how much I'm gonna miss Obama #DebateNight
I had always suspected I lived in a big fat ugly bubble #debates
Having been not paid for work under flimsy pretext I can't help but take Trump's "didn't do a good job" comment personally. #biteme #debates
"I also have a much better temperament than she does." &lt;&lt; yep. And better hair. #NeverTrump #debates
Taking the oil? That is a war crime! What is wrong with u Donald Trump? #debatenight
@searihilyard thank you. Every vote counts.  I need to get to the presidential debates so I can roast Hilary
Trump's pneumonia, is the best, greatest pneumonia ever!  SNIFF SNIFF SNIFF SNIFF SNIFF  #debates
we should just invade countries and take their stuff. These guys are foreign policy aces #debatenight
So, it should be pretty clear that whoever wins, there will be war. I hope you like war, it's been a while. Time for war fun. #debatenight
@pattonoswalt Sniffles needs all that air intake to keep talking over himself. Is he gonna have a heart attack?  #Debates2016
If trump knows how to run a corporate and keep all job's secure answer this why you submitted bankrupt.  #America  #ImWithHer   #Debates
Donald Trumps speaks for communities he doesn't care about, he only cares about property and investments #DebateNight
Trump says his taxes "would be squandered". Did he just admit he pays no taxes? #debatenight
Here we go again with these damn emails. Someone get @realDonaldTrump a plunger since he keeps bringing up old stuff. #DebateNight
Donald Trump said "I have a much better temperament than she has." ...what? #debatenight
I agree with HRC on this, Trickle Down Economics is terrible.Even @WarrenBuffett said before super rich should be taxed higher #debatenight
"You decided to stay home", no she "prepared for the debate". #debatenight #Debates2016
What in the HELL does your witch hunt of Obama #birtherism have to do with ISIS?!? #debatenight
We laughed at cringed at the movie #Idiocracy, but here we are... #debatenight #Debates2016 #TrumpVsClinton
RIP the English language.  Cause of death: Donald Trump attempting to "Debate." #debatenight
GO HILLARY GO!  GRAB HIM BY THE SHORT HAIRS!!!  #DebateNight
Aw, @realDonaldTrump is getting all pissy ALREADY. We haven't even reached the 30 minute mark #debatenight
Why is he talking about this club? #debatenight was that an answer?
#debatenight Obama is loving this debate, America is guaranteed to have a worse President than he was
Ooh I was waiting for this, a man who can be baited by a tweet.  BOOM #debatenight
Not a big fan of Trump. 100% not a fan of @HillaryClinton. All things being equal, Trump is winning #debatenight
It's clear Donald didn't prepare one iota for tonight. Everything is "unbelievable." #debatenight #hisownreality #sniffsniff
THANK GOD HE TOLD HIM TO SHUT UP THANK GOD YOUR A GOD SENT MAN AT DESK #debatenight
Trump says Japan should pay us for defense? After WE forced THEM to pass a constitution that proscribes fielding a military? #TCCUS #Debates
How does anyone support this guy, especially women, minorities, non-Christians, etc.? #debates #debatenight #Debates2016
Trump's back to claiming that the IRS won't allow him to release tax Reyes mid-audit. Lester points out that this is total BS. #debates
So you're getting mad at Trump for not showing his Audible but you won't talk about the emails? Shut up Hilary.  #debatenight
@realDonaldTrump this is why you should prepare for a debate, even if you think you don’t need to do so.  #Debates2016
It'll be cool when my kids ask about the 2016 election and I just laugh uncomfortably and change the subject #DebateNight
There's a "hood" and "ghetto" in every state period! Stop bringing up Chicago all the damn time. 🙄 #debatenight
Did Lester Holt include question on nuclear first response just to demonstrate that Trump has no clue what he's talking about? #debatenight
We should not bring back Law &amp; Order, it's had it's run and there are much better shows on tv right now #debates
.@realDonaldTrump just said he was proud of getting @POTUS to show his birth certificate - aka he was proud to be openly racist #debates
Trump: "you were cooler in the 90s and I think you'll find that you'll agree with me." #debates
Newsweek: We deeply regret not including the phrase "big leagues" in our #debates bingo card.
terrorism and asymmetrical warfare dictates ideology lives past dead people. a military solution is impossible #debatenight
"We're getting plowed in the ass by the oil companies and the gas companies. " #ItsAlwaysSunny or #DonaldTrump? #Debates
"Either he will be leading us in ten years... Or we'll be dead by his hand." #30Rock or #DonaldTrump #debatenight
Trump takes blame off himself using the crowd mentality. Classic coward.  #debatenight
@FrankLuntz problem with debates I think we've learned a lot (from emails, etc.) that will not be discussed fully or at all in this setting
Lol yo @realDonaldTrump you might wanna stop arguing and check the articles you keep quoting #debatenight #debates
A little less audience admonishment and a little more Trump admonishment, Lester. #Debates2016
@SethMacFarlane if he doesn't lose points after this, I've lost faith in our ability to lead the world. Would Peter vote for him? #debates
Trump is definitely not one to call people holier than thau. #debates
"My ten year old...he's so good with these newfangled computer things."  #debates
Is anyone else noticing he's only talking about cities he owns property/has investments in? #debatenight
Oh god. Did you just confirm you are one of those politicians who only care about racism at election season Donald? #debatenight
One thing you can't deny Trump - he sure has experience with huge debts. #DebateNight
Trump conveniently overlooks the fact that his rhetoric is one of ISIS' greatest tools. #DebateNight
How did we get these two for candidates for president again? I mean I know I was out of the country for 5months but goddamn #debates
How many people are exploring a career in the drapery business? It has been mentioned enough. #debatenight
Candidates are wearing lapel mics, maybe podium mics are there to keep them from walking the room like a Jimmy Stewart movie #debatenight
Trump "We don't have the money." You don't have the plan. Hillary Clinton does.  #debatenight
Before the night is over, Irrelevant Lester will be attacked by Trump, possibly before this debate is over. #debates
And very likely RT @missnaturalle: Donald loves to say well 2 things #debatenight
Not positive, but I'm guessing this is the first time ever that "braggadocios" has been uttered in a presidential debate. #DebateNight
@realDonaldTrump: "I have property there." Since when does this automatically mean you cared about the PEOPLE WHO LIVE THERE? #debatenight
does anyone know what he's rambling about? this is now stand-up comedy #debatenight
he said his in the Forum, and I just said what? #Debates2016
I am smart, and I love paying my taxes. Best ROI in the world.   #debatenight #taxes
Lester put against @realDonaldTrump against the wall with hacking and birtherism. As we say in Mexico, SOPAS. #debatenight
Trump says avoiding taxes makes him smart. Clinton responds to his bait on emails by owning up to it, apologizing. You judge. #Debates2016
How are you going to be vigilant? I'm so confused. Law &amp; Order is a show, fam. And Stop and Frisk???? #Debates2016
Trump says he succeeded in getting Obama to giving him birth certificate. Why did he succeed? "Because I'm gonna defeat ISIS." #Debates2016
Hillary should've dropped the mic and walked out after she said "I was preparing to be President of the United States" #debatenight
"But let's get back to the question you asked..." oh yeah, that pesky thing. Thanks, Hil. #debatenight
Well LESTER. Whose fault is it that you're SO behind schedule? #moderatorFail  #debatenight
Lies you did support the war in Iraq 😂😂 dnt try to take it back now #debatenight
"I have a much better temperament than she does," Drumpf says after yelling. #debatenight
In case noone heard Trump just gave himself a pat on the back for his little bit of a relationship that he just created with AfAme #debates
Soooo I'm watching #debatenight &amp; all I hear trump doing is name dropping who "correctly" quoted him
I mean, don't we all know who we're voting for at this point anyway? #Debates2016
Trump sounds like a catfish on the internet: "Yeah, I have a friend who can totally back me up on this. It totally happened, man." #Debates
I dont no about any of you, but i don't give a flying fuck about either one of the tax returns. #debatenight
TRUMP: I was against the war. HOLT: The record shows otherwise.  #debatenight #Debates2016
Love that Hillary referenced Michelle Obama’s speech… can we say the same about Melania’s speech? Welps.  #ImWithHer #debates
I'm learning a lot from trump tonight. He just said you learn nothing from tax returns #bishhwhat #debatenight #Debates2016
Wait, is #DonaldTrump taking credit for inventing the internet?? Sorry dude, that was #AlGore #debates
"As soon as she releases something she's not required to release, I'll release what everyone since 1980 has released." #Debates2016
The fact that Gary Johnson is not in this debate debacle is just BULLSHIT #debates #GovGaryJohnson
i'm pretty sure the last hour and a half has made me dumber. #debatenight
Fun fact: when Trump says he didn't support the Iraq war he came out with that when it became the popular opinion to be against #debatenight
So, did @realDonaldTrump have a pound of coke to prep for this #Debates2016 or what?
Can't tell if this is a reality television show or a presidential debate. #debatenight
Still don't know what the plan would be for stopping Home-grown Terrorism. Come on Lester. Get control of #debatenight
Not gonna lie she kept it real on that bias answer #debatenight
Did you hear that dog whistle 🔊 Law and Order... #gtfoh  #debatenight
Stop and frisk did not lower the crime rate in NYC. It only allowed the police to further discriminate against people of color. #debatenight
The exact systems that allow rich white men like Trump to stay wealthy create the "danger" he fearmongers about. #debatenight
What I hate most is he doesn't speak in quantifiable terms. "Everyone" "Lots of places" "All over" #debatenight
Should I take a drink everytime this debate makes me laugh instead of making me think? #debatenight
Police are afraid to do anything but they killing brothers and sisters left and right. Trump shut it🙄 #debatenight
You being a businessman does not make you equipped to run a country. Please go back to the whole you came out of🙄 #debatenight
Trump just used the word "Braggadocios"! I don't think anyone expected that! #debatenight
Boom Mic Drop on the "Preparing to be President" comment by HRC. #debatenight
@realDonaldTrump and @HillaryClinton are like children 👶🏼 but I'm still rooting for Hilly!! #Debates
No schools? No roads? No hospitals? "Maybe because you haven't paid any federal taxes".  Line of the night😏#debatenight
TRUMO STOP TRYING TO DENY THAT YOU SUPPORT THE IRAQ INVASION YOU PRICK #debatenight #debates
Did you know Donald Trump is the foremost authority on "paying your fair share"? #debatenight
I'm not with Hillary, but I sure as hell am not with Trump. Who am I with?   Alcohol. And lots of it. 🍻 #cheers #Debates2016 #debatenight
Really just want the moderator to ask Trump to name more than 5 countries and end this whole thing #DebateNight
Watching the debate trying to see who I hate less 😕 #debatenight
Not paying taxes does NOT make you smart! It makes you a social leech! #debatenight
Since when have our police been afraid to do anything? The problem is the exact opposite... #debatenight
#debatenight #debates Trump new hotel built with Chinese goods.  No America first when it comes to Trump greed.
Holt: Do you want to respond to Hillary's discussion of her emails? Trump: China has incredible airports.  #debatenight
When HRC does the Jim Halpert 'look into the camera and roll her eyes' thing I live. #debatenight
Trump talking about tax cuts for the wealthy. Why you gonna lower taxes on the wealthy.  #debatenight
USA is doing the same sneaky cyber breaches towards other countries.. 😒 so shut up Hillary #debatenight
Donald keep saying what she didn't do and whatever...SHE WASNT PRESIDENT DONNY. Lol what can she do? #debatenight
I bet the over on #MNF but forgot to take it on the #Debates2016 too
Dear @HillaryClinton,  Common sense gun safety to us means to go get a CWP #debatenight @NRA
Clinton Foundation!  Clinton Foundation!  Clinton Foundation!  She keeps that money coming in from every source.   #debatenight
@ABC Trump has completely ruined the debates. He has made it all about him.
The money says out not cus of red tape but because they don't want to pay taxes #Debates
Why won't someone just turn off Trump's mic during Clinton's time? 😩 #debatenight
Now Trump is resurrecting the specter of Bernie. Man does that fight seem a decade old #debatenight
Clinton is the master of both the side eye and the disapproving stare. #debatenight
#debates. Let's ga w it. Neither one of these should be on this stage. I'm not voting. Does it really matter?
The way THE WHOLE WORLD on Twitter is on about this #debates e.g #celebritytwitter, #hoetwitter, #buymyproducttwitter, # relationshiptwitter
@vvviu said "Oooh, he's thirsty,"!on #DonaldTrump saying he's gonna get to Pennsylvania Avenue one way or the other. #debatenight
Can we just shut off Trump's mike when it's Hilary's two minutes, please? #Debates
When is Hillary actually gonna debate &amp; make a point? She has yet to even say anything worth taking note of. #debatenight
Here we go with Hillary wanting to take away guns. Guns are not the problem, criminals are. #Debates2016
The fact that the debate is genuinely entertaining scares the hell out of me. The future of our country is serious business 🙃#debatenight
We get it, you have properties everywhere. Even in Chicago. 🙄 #debatenight
concern for "African Americans &amp; Hispanic People" señor donald? Not even KKK believes u that's why they support you #debates #debates2016
@HeatherNauert @foxandfriends Megan Kelly said it was freezing in the building at the beginning before debates began.
Trump: Watch me fish for some black votes by mentioning "SUPER PREDATOR".  Blacks: Nice try, jackass.  #NoseBreather #DebateNight
@realDonaldTrump literally admits he'll take advantage of the law to his gain #debates
So we gonna blame propel getting killed and shot dead for no reason but those who are suppose to bring Law &amp; Order on Obama 😡😡 #Debates2016
I feel like I've gorged myself on schadenfreude. Something inside me literally feels full and satisfied having watched that. #DEBATES2016
@HillaryClinton has @realDonaldTrump in his feelings and he isn't giving policy at all and has become the schoolyard bully...#Debates2016
Trump is HATING being fact-checked about his previous support of the Iraq War.... 😂😂😂 #Debates2016
Confused as to why #AfricanAmerican community is synonymous with "inner-city" in Trumpspeak #debatenight
#Debates2016  doesn't want to use words?  Seriously, is this a mantra or something that will make everything better?
#debatenight I sincerely belive that can be more worst for t.r.u.m.p .. #sorrynotsorry
It's most problematic to me that trump supporters don't see issues with what' he's saying, lies and all. #debatenight
Does Trump have Alzheimer's? Because he's always repeating his sentences... 🤔 #debatenight
Ooooh I wonder if the people excited about Trump mentioning the emails are...also...racists???? #debatenight
Law and Order and illegal immigrants are all criminals in that statement from Trump. Dog whistling is deafening. #debates
Wow @realDonaldTrump sure likes Law &amp; Order, was that a lead in to The Apprentice #Debates2016 #DebateNight
How many lines did you do pre-debate tonight? *sniff @realDonaldTrump sip-sip-sip! #thirstyforvotes  #debatenight
"Bernie Sanders was taken advantage of."  Something we all can agree on. #debatenight
#Debates Trump wily thief and hillary evidenced by calm and confidence 👍🏽
I just jumped in... has there been anything about the country instead of the candidates yet? #Debates
He talks about what everyone else has done. But can’t tell us what he’s going to do. #debatenight
He loves to tell her that she’s wrong…..BUT WON’T SAY HOW. #debatenight
"I prepared to be President" line of the night for me from Hilary #debatenight  @KevinFrankish @WinstonSih
I didn't realize Trump was so good at dancing...around the question. #DebateNight
More homeless than ever, public urination, drinking out in open. DiBlasio's the worst mayor of NYC #debatenight #kellyfile
All I have to say is Choke on Satan's Dick @HillaryClinton and Die 💀 #Debates2016 #debatenight
#debates And here goes Trump! Oh yeah, the wealthy are really interested in helping the middle class. NOT!
Well let's get one thing clear;Hillary is against stop and frisk #debatenight
Donald might just have a cold. I wonder if the news outlets are going to make this a thing like they did pneumonia. #Debates2016
Are we really willing to consider this man's access to nuclear codes? #debates2016 #hillsvsdon #ImWithHer
I don't know what to say other than wow... This is unbelievable. #debatenight
This is a presidential debate, don't make a plug for your own fucking hotel!!! What the hell is wrong with you?! #debatenight
according to Trump, gun control sounds a GREAT idea when black people &amp; immigrants are involved #debates
Sooo...apparently everything in the US is either a disaster or beautiful. #debatenight
Trump saying we have 5 trillion to give in part to inner cities #Debates
So, I 'm guessing The New York Times is picking @HillaryClinton as the winner tomorrow morning. #debatenight
Donald stay on topic, for the love of God please stay on topic!!🙄 #debatenight #PresidentialDebate
This is one of the worst debates I have ever seen in my life.  Bring @DrJillStein and @GovGaryJohnson to the stage please. #Debates2016
No, Donald. We haven't become a third world country. We're still great. #debatenight
I love following the literary community during a debate featuring Donald. It gives me hope for people who aren't Donald. #debatenight
"Stop and frisk was unconstitutional because it was ineffective" and it violated the 4th Amendment in spirit and letter. #Debates2016
Trump Thoughts- "damn she can change the past! Yell false more and change it! Ha! Never supported the war, all thanks to yelling" #debates
#debates has anyone noticed how they split screen, but don't give Trump single screen time, but give it 2 her?
We actually live in a world where an American Presidential nominee admits to not paying tax #debatenight
Apparently Lester works for the IRS? He's decided it's perfectly fine? #Debates #debatenight
#debatenight oh YES. now let us talk about social issues. I just saw an aide bring Trump a foot. Yep its… it looks like it is mouth-bound
Listening to @realDonaldTrump speak is like riding a psychotic horse towards a burning stable.  #Debates #Debates2016
Paused the debate to go to the bathroom and now I'm 5 minutes behind every anti-Trump tweet. Damnit. #debatenight
#Debates I need Lester Holt to take control. I'm having trouble hearing all the lies.
The country is broke because Trump doesn't pay enough in taxes? That makes tons of sense....... #debates #debatenight
.@ChloeAngyal I admire that she's so cool in front of an audience of ~100M w/the Presidency on the line. #Debates2016 @LDBurnett
Hillary bringing up white privilege and systematic racism. She is showing real plans and understanding. Trump is all bluster. #DebateNight
Trump is speaking so nonsenseably that it is hard to pick a thing to critique. #PresidentialDebate #DebateNight #Debates2016
Hillary is running circle around Trump on current issues. Trump is stuck on old Bush era issues. Long before Hillary or Potus.#DebateNight
The no fly list would be a racist tool to take people's right to own a gun. #debates
Trickle down economics didn't work with Reagan and it won't work now. Are any trump voters actually educated? #debatenight
#Debates Hillary apparently memorized all the names of who the US has been funding in Syria.  Wonder who was Sec of State when started
She's got him completely off his game and on his heels. He doesn't have the crowd to feed off of. #Debates2016 #debatenight
"We came in with the Internet, we came up with the Internet" -@realDonaldTrump #Debates2016
@scrowder #Debates2016 wrong Clinton, leading cause of death is not firearms, not even including suicides
I will say I really enjoy the amount of coverage these #debates have received. It's on like 10 TV channels, streaming on FB, Twitter, etc...
Melman save us #debatenight (if anyone gets this I luv u 4 life)
It's like watching a sniffling 4-year old orange-crusted Oompa Loompa debate a college professor. This is maniacal. #Debates2016
Take a shot for every snapchat story of the #Debates2016. You will die.
All Trump knows how to do is shout and yell. While Hilary clearly states her point in a very calm manner #debatenight
Do you know how to answer one, single question in a straightforward way, Donald? Just one? #Debates
Hillary is professional whilst Trump acts like a infant. Shameful you want a immature boy in the presidential home. #Debates2016
I just threw up a little in my mouth #debatenight live stream
I'll stop now, I'm honestly not even watching. I could care less about what these 2 clowns have to say. I've heard enough #debatenight
Under trump Muslims would be put in concentration camps like jewish people during the holocaust that didn't exist. Jackass! #debatenight
I love how my homework is to watch the debate ✨ #debatenight
I'm very pleased with what i'm seeing on twitter about the #debatenight
Hillary should just hit him with the " lol you wild." Since he wants to say some off the wall shit #Debates2016
Stop saying law and order. you are ruining that show for me. #debates
Inspired by Little Marco RT @suziparker: Donald Trump sure is drinking a lot of water. And I mean, a lot of water. #debatenight
Admirals and generals endorsed trump? Oh and the klan. Let's not forget that. #debates
Trump might have mixed up Obama &amp; Tiger Woods, but I swear not all Black people are the same. #debatenight
"I love the constitution" -Donald Trump  "Let's ignore the constitution!" - also Donald Trump  #Debates2016  #DonaldLogic
#debatenight   Hmmm  Trump seemed interested in Hillary's mental health care idea
NATO countries don't pay what they owe us SAYS THE MAN WHO DOESN'T PAY HIS CONTRACTORS! #debatenight
26 minutes in, and Donald J #Trump made his first scream. Who won the bet? #DebateNight #Debates2016
HRC could go in for the kill... Trump looks like a stammering idiot. #debatenight
He is incoherent and repetitive. I can't see how he'll survive this #debatenight
Is there going to be a week long news cycle about Trump's health now? #debatenight
#Debates2016 Hillary: "Implicit bias is a problem for everyone." She's a racist too? All white people apparently need "bias training."
#Debates2016  Trump must be speaking a good 30 percent more than Hillary. Maybe more. She seems to enjoy the rest.
"That makes me smart" Trump tells us to not paying federal taxes. Again, not a good look #debatenight
#debates not a lot being communicated when it comes to inner city and political let downs = growing up in #cleveland was not easy w/ dems
Trump bangs on about "law and order" but the problem is clearly gun violence! Too many deaths! #debatenight #USPresidentialDebate
did he just tell the secretary of state that she stayed home too much #debatenight
My question for the debate is, what do they do when they have to do to the bathroom? Are they both wearing Depends??? #debatenight
Donald Trump: The African American community is so abused  Lester: Donald uh--  DT: Shut up Lester  #debatenight
A. Big. Fat. Ugly. Bubble. --  The entire election process? #Trump #debatenight #Debates2016
I just watched 3min of the #Debates2016 and Donald already embarrassed himself and Hillary drove his shit through the mud
trump is right about how African-Americans in Chicago are risking their lives just walking down the streets #DebateNight
Is there a moderator for this debate? Where are you, Lester? #debatenight
"this janet yellen"? she's the head of the federal reserve. have some respect.  #Debates
If Trump hates politicians so much why is he trying to be one? #debatenight
"They talk good around election time." Unlike Trump, who never speaks well. #debatenight
So what happened in Charleston wasn't homegrown terrorism? We have a serious issuevwith who we perceive as terroristic threats #Debates2016
@ANichols70 if nothing else from tonight we know America will soon have strong airports and drapes #debatenight
Donald Trump said, "That makes me smart," when Hillary said he has not paid income tax. So what, the rest of us are all stupid. #DebateNight
The latest conservative nugget is blaming Obama for all shootings. I love that one. #headdesk #debatenight
Going to my happy place, going to my happy place... It's not working. #debatenight #Debates2016
So trump can interrupt Clinton all he wants but says "excuse me" when she does the same thing?? #Debates2016 #DebateNight
I don't know if talking about how underleveraged you are is going to win you undecideds. #debatenight
Trump just alienated all his contributors that are also defense contractors. #debatenight
trump is literally putting himself in a blender talking about policing, stop and frisk, race and guns. #debatenight
We need law and order..  but apparently we don't need to pay taxes #debatenight #PresidentialDebate
I'm mad at Trump I'm not going to work tomorrow.I think Ima use my brain power to be mad all day cuz he racist.sounds dumb huh #debatenight
"I have a winning temperament."  I'm sorry @realDonaldTrump, but you don't!  #debate #debatenight #politics
After yelling for the last hour, "I have a great temperament." 😂😂😂😂 #debates
Mall attacks committed by #Muslims in the last 10 days in America:  2 5 Dead, 14 injured That's in the last week and a half.  #debatenight
I can't help but notice all these little negative footnotes about Trump and it just happens to be aired on Fox. #Debates
I used to think that I had a place in the internet, I don't know where I belong to now #debatenight
Cmon. Now @realDonaldTrump spiraled into "temperament." A man would never discuss the temperament of another man. #debatenight
Serious question: does @realDonaldTrump get an intermission during #Debates2016 to change his diaper?
These two idiots make my head hurt.  I'm not longer undecided. #GaryJohnson2016 #garyjohnson #debates #debatenight
#debates don't want to hear presidential candidates attack each other. Show us how u can lead
#Debates2016 Trump's tax plan clearly says 15% flat business tax. 10% repatriation one time fee to bring money back from overseas.
#Debates2016 He wouldn't rent to people who couldn't afford to pay the rent!!!!
Ok, Lester Holt was getting hate from me earlier, but his fact checks are at least on point. #debatenight
Personal views aside. Trump is an uninformed, belligerent, and petulant oaf. I understand your Hillary trepidations but c'mon. #debatenight
I get randomly audited all the freaking time. Every year. But so what? If I wanted to be President, or Prime Minister I'd do it #debatenight
I feel like getting on Twitter during debates will just lower my faith in humanity even more #debatenight
Is it too late to use the C-word? As in CHOKER? #debatenight
WTF @LesterHoltNBC Admonish the audience? The voters? We The People?! Bring it you shit eating communist bastard #Debates2016 #debatenight
Group I'm watching this debate with broke out in laughter when Trump said he had better judgement than Hillary. #loserdonald #debatenight
@DonSeymour Can you tell me why they have mixed up their party colours?? #debatenight
Alllllll this shade though... my gawd. Lol — watching Presidential Debates 2016

"a city I love... a city where I have investments" RED FLAG #Debates
My employer won't expand his business with higher taxes and increased regulation!  Yours?  #Debates2016
Your kicking her ass @realDonaldTrump...don't let her get away with any more lies...#debatenight #TrumpPence #Hofstra #MAGA
@realDonaldTrump we have the B-2 stealth bomber. Perhaps you were thinking of Love Shack. #debates
Yep Donald, you sure have great judgement and a great temperament. You've made that very clear tonight. 💯🙄#Debates2016
Notice how he doesn't address his polices. Just says he has them. #Trump #Debates2016 #debatenight #ImWithHer
How does Donald know about money when he got his from his Daddy??? #debatenight
Coming under budget and ahead of schedule is easy when you pad all your estimates. #debates
Clinton going after Trump business practices, trying to tear down his perceived strength as a businessman #debatenight
When Donald Trump Praised Rudy Giuliani's 'Stop &amp; Frisk,' Which Was Found Unconstitutional, Is When I Turned The Channel #debatenight
I don't find this debate funny at all. It's just reinforces that our country is extremely polarized. #debatenight
How can you talk about cyber security without 1st addressing HRC lack of ability to understand today's technology  #debatenight
Give Lester Holt some suspenders, and call him Larry King.  Anyone else notice the resemblance?  #debates
Does Hillary have nothing except stupid personal attacks? She's obviously never run a business. #debates #debatenight
Every time Trump says "law and order" I am yelling *CHUNG CHUNG* #debatenight
Looks like I chose the wrong debate to get off post-ankle surgery opiates (true story, that happened last week). #debates
my eng. professor says conflict is appealing to general audiences. this all seems like an unbelievable joke. 🙃#Debates2016
The only thing keeping me on this #debates stream is the fact they're jumping to live feeds of Art Farm and some of the animals in it.
So Lester Holt has been a nothing moderator. I barely notice he's there, just lets them do whatever they want. #debates
"We have to stop the violence. We have to bring back the law and order." says Trump and uses Chicago crime rates as an example #Debates
"I was the one who got him to produce the birth certificate" brags Trump on the topic of President Obama's U.S. citizenship #Debates
The guy who's interrupted his opponent and questioned the moderator on facts claims his temperament as his best asset. OK. #debatenight
Trump's attempt at The Godfather: 'leave the troops, take the oil' #debatenight
.@realDonaldTrump just admitted on the debate stage that he does not pay Federal income #tax #TaxEvasion #debates
#debatenight You can't run the country like a business .. That essentially is an oligarchy ... I know what that looks like first hand
#debatenight OMG!! He's destroying the political class , responsible for the mess over decades .. And Hillary has to defend them? Tough
Trump is fucking up sooooo bad it's not even funny anymore. Hilary holding her own tho. #debates
Aww Donald just wants a Law &amp; Order reboot. Maybe it'll get picked up by Netflix. #Debates2016
Trump would do much better if he would be quiet and let Clinton respond. She sounds arrogant and elitist but he needs to chill #debatenight
Clinton and Trump were both on the birther train... let's move on please. Both are wrong. #debatenight
Y'all notice how trump clocked her on rigging the elections against Bernie and she talking about isis #debatenight #Debates2016
So who are these "bad people" that are currently allowed to have guns that shouldn't 🤔. #DebateNight
"You treated [Obama] with terrible disrespect" as I trounce all over your rebuttbals with my shouty sniffly interruptions. #debates
@ThePerezHilton Who has on more make up? I think #Trumpster has on more make up than my fav Queen of Drag @ChadMichaels1.💚😳😏🙏💋 #debatenight
I can't remember what other cities becomes, "Various other cities, I could name them all; whatever." #debatenight
This is just an ad campaign for Trumps buildings at this point. #debates
Trump is clearly the law and order candidate. Hillary is clueless on security. #debatenight
Military style weapons for civilians don't exist. Shows how ignorant Clinton is on the subject. I'm military, I know. #debatenight #debates
Hillary says terrorists with knowledge of nuclear information must be stopped. I hope they don't read her emails... #debatenight #debates
i thought i was bad on bringing my English out, but man Donald you beat me, your language is worse than a middle schooler! #debatenight
Can we all just agree that we're absolutely fucked come November? Neither candidate has any business running this country. #debatenight
Is he serious? I swear he loves to hear himself talk #debatenight
Trump is now arguing with the moderator. "The record shows I'm right." [About his lack of support for the war.] #debatenight
Hillary starting to look like the Cheshire Cat as Trump goes off the rails. His debate coaches have to be dying right now. #debatenight
Oh! Rimshot! Trump going to get to PA Ave by buying a building next door to the White House? #debatenight
"I can't stand that bitch. Hope she doesn't become president."- shit my husband says #debatenight
Pls @HillaryClinton u need my tax plan. 17% flat tax on all income &gt; $25000. That's the way 2 go. EVERYONE rich or poor pays.#debates2016
@HillaryClinton don't you think Dem mayors are the big contributor of black men being killed. #Debates2016
Trump: "6 trillion dollars we spent in the middle east, we could have rebuilt our country twice!" Made me lol. #debatenight
No one can tell me that Hillary is not being held to a different standard than Donald. #Debates2016
I feel embaraced that a portion of my fellow Americans believe this racist bigot should be president #DebateNight
American airports are alright, actually.  I've been to Newark and JFK.  Both fine.  #Debates
Can't believe that people on the terrorist watch list at the moment are able to buy guns.  #Debates
NO body called Sean HANNITY!!!! - Trump This should be on t-shirts...lol Is he serious? - #debatenight
Trump has been on the offensive this whole debate. An admirable trait needed in a president. #debatenight
He just grabbed some of her phraseology for repairing police - community relations? #debates2016
"We cannot just say 'law and order', we have to come up with a plan." aight hillz #debatenight #HCHSgovt
I thought we'd already determined that @POTUS was American ... whyyyyy did @realDonaldTrump bring this up again? #debatenight
I'm tweeting things before I think them through. This is very fun. Highly recommend it. #Debates
@GMA @HillaryClinton @realDonaldTrump It doesn't seems like a presidential debate ; it seems like a TV show #debatenight
Donald is struggling to even form full sentences. Literally run-ons on top of run-ons. Boy, you are struggling. I hear no policy? #debates
After the occurrence of this past week....what on earth makes you think the term "bad people" is acceptable to use??? #debatenight
Aside from Hillary Clinton as president, I too agree that nuclear weapons are the single greatest threat to national security. #debatenight
#debates #debatenight incredible debate, the only goal is to make America a land of opportunity for Latinos
That's right he even stiff those young girls who sang and danced at one of your rallies and these young girls are now suing  #Debates
The Donald could not control his rallies ha! Do you think you can control anything else give me a break #Debates
Tribal war in the middle east real and a constant irregular-less what the USA thinks  #Debates
I would rather have someone who hasn't paid workers than someone who killed people in Benghazi... #debatenight
Just like Trump doesn't know what the word is humble is, he doesn't know what temperament means. #debates #debatenight
HAHAHA trump going after someone for being disrespectful during debates so insane I respect it. Crazy like a fox #debatenight
Stop &amp; Frisk didn't do SHIT in NYC, you lying fucking burnt Cheeto. #Debates2016
#debatenight #Debates2016 #Hillary2016 interrupt his ass @realDonaldTrump just like his rudeness interrupts you.  #Hillary is full of class
Donald Trump has absolutely no clue what he's talking about. *scheduled tweet #debatenight
The only thing I know about Trump is that he owns property in almost every awful city #debates #trumpclintondebate
Attempted Trap question: What is Obama's nuclear policy. Trump side stepped it #debatenight
I knew trump was going to bring that up...I was just waiting on it.  #debatenight
So what are the numbers..$650 million Trump's businesses owe to Wall Street, and what, over $1billion to the Chinese government #debatenight
Remember when the pundits said that this was going to be about visions for the country's future? #debatenight
"You don't learn much from tax return statements" Ummmm, I mean, we will know if you paid taxes #debatenight
Oh god not sure I want to hear about @realDonaldTrump talking about bridging race gaps... Fix the gaps in your logic first #Debates2016
"Someone who knows about money" SAYS THE ONE WHOSE BUSINESSES ARE GOING BANKRUPT LEFT &amp; RIGHT. OOOOOKAY~ #DebateNight
Take a shot everytime you hear Trump say China. You're dead before you take a drink. #debatenight #Debates2016
Can we be certain Trump doesn't have vodka in that glass? Certainly wouldn't surprise me... #debatenight
Funny how Lester Holt challenged Trump on the constitutionality of stop and frisk, but not Hillary on terror watch lists. #debatenight
Donald is a lot of "facts" but not a lot of "how we're gonna fix it." #debates
TRUMP TELLING SO MANY LIES ABOUT NOT SUPPORTING THE WAR IN IRAQ.  #debatenight #ImWithHer
Why are we still talking about Obama's birth certificate??!!!???!!?!?!?!?!?!   #debatenight
#debatenight @realDonaldTrump is an idiot of what he said about the #birther. Why did he ask Pres. Bush to produce his birth certificate?
This is so sickening!!!!! Like this is a joke, right?!?! These two ppl can't be our only choices...😡#debatenight #Debates2016
“We’re talking about racial healing in this segment, what do you say —“ Trump: “I say nothing” *talks about birth certificate* #debatenight
At this point it's almost like an adult is lecturing a child #Debates2016
Trump bragging about his endorsements from police is not going to sway voters that are being targeted by police. #Debates2016
Move it on moderator. Grow a fucking spine and shut Trump up. Next topic. #Debates2016
Trump just lost the 400lb neck beard vote. There goes any chance he was going to get the emails back #debates #debatenight
why does Trump keep mentioning @BarackObama ? Mr. Obama is an OUTGOING President! GET OVER IT TRUMP! Talk about YOUR solutions #debates
is Trump serious? he has the audacity to tell @HillaryClinton that something she said was "not a very nice thing to say"? #debatenight
"I have a much better temperament than her."  Does Trump understand English? #DebateNight #ImWithHer
I have developed relations with the African Americans over the last little while..#debates
How can a man who owes million dollars in debt be able to take this country out of debt? #debatenight #debates #Debates2016
Once again... Where is this going? What. Is. He. Saying? Where is the policy? Where are the solutions? #debatenight #ImWithHer
Hillary is looking at Trump like Mary Poppins to the children.   "Are you quite finished?"  #debatenight
We're going to help his country by investing in business that, if they're good businesses, won't pay any taxes. #TrumpLogic #debatenight
Trump is all over the place. What is Lester doing??? Step up! #debatenight
I love it how she is just standing there letting him talk himself into a hole #DebateNight
Now trump can't say she won't say I s I s  #debatenight  perfect
Moderator sounds kinda like debate participant, if you accent the right syllable. #Debates
#debatenight  Trump is losing it.  Shouldn't moderator hold each to their time?  Or is it free for all!
Why is Trump losing? Because he cant stop talking about himself &amp; how wonderful he thinks he is. #debates  #debatenight
#DebateNight No, he insults Moose-limbs, not Muslims. Listen it's all in the details
Do I want a president that dsnt do homework and gets in front of class and BS through? Nah, I'll pass on that - I trust a geek #debatenight
Why has no one told Trump "bigly" isn't a fuckin word goddammit!! #debatenight
Hearing people are angry she's not fighting back. So she can't stand there OR fight back? SEXISM IS PREVALENT, PEOPLE. #Debates
"Just LISTEN to what you heard." Omg, that is my new favorite one line ever. All the meanings in that. #debatenight
"It was a mistake and I take responsibility for it." THAT'S how you do it. #debatenight
I wonder what it would be like to respond in professional life with "WRONG" &amp;no explanation. Food for thought, client meetings #Debates2016
Also, would like #Clinton to use "we" instead of "they" when talking about the wealthy. You're very rich. It's ok #debatenight
"Bring Stop &amp; Frisk back"??It was unconstitutional 4 Racial Profiling! Trump 😡 I didn't think he could get any worse #debatenight Idiot
All those SNL and Between Two Ferns appearances are paying off for Clinton. #debatenight
Tell me how I've been let down. Especially cuz I'm a black American not in a inner city. #debatenight
Let's be clear, #Trump is a whiny, petulant man-boy who uses insults for campaign slogans. It's just that #Clinton is bad. #Debates
In fairness to Trump, he has addressed cyber before. It is so big. #debatenight
Here we go again with President Obama's birth certificate for the billionth time he was born in Hawaii Donald do your research #debates
Trump just said "you're wrong" when Lester Holt presented facts about stop--and-frisk. #debatenight
I'm out. Nothing said tonight is going to change my mind. She certainly isn't perfect but at least she's not a raging lunatic. #debatenight
If you take a small sip of beer every time Trump mentions companies leaving the U.S. you'll be belligerently drunk in minutes #debates
What is with all these fact checks?! I want to know what you're going to do about these issues #debatenight
Am I the only one waiting for "Live from New York, it's Saturday Night" listening to this debate!? #DebateNight
@realDonaldTrump : "I will release my tax returns when she releases her 30k deleted email." #jabjabhook #debatenight
Understand the context of the NATO statements. A man who won't show us his financials says cats don't pay their fair share. #Debates2016
Please please please make his head explode when it come to putin... #debatenight #ImWithHer
The woman who used unsecure email for years is lecturing on cyber security?? #hypocrite #PresidentialDebate #debatenight
Only America can be simultaneously be a superpower but considered a 3rd world country #Debates
I really don't care about the emails. Honestly. I'm concerned that I'm paying thousands of dollars the feds and you're not. #debatenight
Every time he "secretary" it sounds like a slur. I've never heard someone make a title of respect sound more like "that cunt". #Debates2016
Oh joy. Donald Trump will now argue about race on live tv. This won't be infuriating. #debates
Debating 101:  Simple phrases. Tax: What are you hiding? Birther: Racist lie  + DON'T CHANGE SUBJECT when he's on the ropes. #debatenight
Oh Ef off its not about your money Trump. That's all this is about! Shut up! #debatenight
“Do you believe police have implicit bias against Black people?” “Lester, I believe implicit bias is a problem for everybody.” #debatenight
"It's a nice day today Donald"  "No fish don't live in oceans, they live in trees" #DebateNight
She's playing him. I've seen my cat bitch-slap mice like this.  #debatenight
Holt: What took you so long, 5 years, to give up on birther conspiracy?  Trump: One of Clinton's people believed it. Once. #Debates2016
Kudos to Lestor Holt for holding Donald Trump's feet to the fire. #Debates2016
The race question came and I said "oh no" knowing I was about to be hella triggered #debatenight
Amazing how @realDonaldTrump said China 3 times in less than 10 seconds  #debatenight
How much did the Platte River guys get paid ?  #debates
Donny making us late to the next bar during the Presidential Debate Pub Crawl. #debatenight
Say it, you know you want to, say "because that's business" #debatenight
WORD😩 RT @farwzaz: I miss Obama's voice so much why didn't we appreciate the 2012 election while it was going on #debatenight
Trump just scored big points hammering Hillary on her emails.  #debatenight
It is, indeed, hell. Until the tip-toeing around that stops &amp; the conversation is honest, body count continues. #Debates2016
#debates #Debates2016 Race, Imagine a guys with DTrumps mindset carrying a badge and walking the streets with the ability to stop &amp; frisk!
"You don't learn a lot from tax returns" - Donald Trump. Uhhhh - yeah you do. #debatenight #pnpcbc
"Why not?" This is all so funny until I realize these are our actual candidates. #debatenight
L. Holt get in there and moderate! Why are you letting @realDonaldTrump bully his way into @HillaryClinton's time to speak? #Debates2016
"I have a feeling by the end of this debate, I'll be blamed for everything," Clinton says. "Why not? "Trump replies. #Debates2016
Who knew this presidential debate we would have TWO democrats debating #Debates2016 #debatenight trump agrees too much with Hillary
Friend: Who do you think is winning the debate?  Me: Satan.   #Debates2016
Take guns from lonely white kids that shoot up schools while we're stereotyping too.. anyone? No? #debatenight
Is there any fact checkers around? "our airports are like a third world country." #Debates2016  #debates #debatenight
#debatenight really, Lester you going to ask about the birth certificate! Old news. Nothing to do with policy. Get serious. Who gives shit?
#debatenight Bullshit on Lester. He is pitching softballs to Hillary to set Trump up for defensive posture only. Ask about her past scandal
Hillary's main draw back is that she is not a very good person. #Debates
i need a shot of that black label like right now #Debates
Please ask Trump to explain how the Fed works and to whom it is accountable. Very clear he doesn't know. #debates
Trump might not be the nicest but hes the best fit for this job. The ones against him seem to be too stupid to understand him #debatenight
Has Hillary been personally fighting ISIS her entire adult life?  How old is she? #debatenight
He can't release those tax returns he's under a routine audit  IRS:  But- Lalalalala I can't hear you we have a trade deficit! #debatenight
I can't get past the 400 pound person on the bed. Please Lester, go back to that for more! #debatenight #400pounds
I'll release my tax return when she releases the 33,000 emails she deleted!! @therealdonald_  Bang Bang!! #SLUdebate #debatenight
His strongest asset is his temperament????? I must be living in a different reality than he is then......#debatenight #debates
THE IRS HAS SAID REPEATEDLY THAT THEY DON'T GIVE A SHIT IF YOU RELEASE THEM DURING AN AUDIT YOU TURD @realDonaldTrump #DebateNight
Trump doesn't even address that police are killing innocent black people #debatenight
Frustrated can we just stick to the topic and attempt to become president instead of tearing each other apart.  #Debates2016
"We need law and order or we are not going to have a country." -Donald Trump #Debates2016
Notice how Trump has no respect for the rules as he constantly talks over Clinton. #DebateNight
I haven't heard two presidential candidates talk this much about black people intentionally in EVER.  #debates
D-dawg there is makin' Hillary look trustworthy. Too bad he doesn't have a better campaign strategy. #debates
Are you even watching #Debates2016 if you don't put a snap story on??
Lester bucks up to Trump but not Hillary. You can tell who he's more afraid of.  Funny. I can't believe these are our choices. #debatenight
All debates aside, the cover photo for @realDonaldTrump's twitter account is one of the worst Photoshop chop jobs I've ever seen
I am hereby starting a support group for those of us who have found out that a close friend is a Trump supporter. #debatenight
Lester don't let him do this to you.  Stand up to this bully. #debatenight
#Debates2016  Trump's says he has unbelievable company. Yes, we DON'T believe you! Gobbledy gook about laws of nation, blah blah.
#Debates2016 Hillary speaks the truth about inequality in stopping &amp; arresting between whites and blacks.
Red is a power color. @HillaryClinton has the dress. @realDonaldTrump has the flushed cheeks. #debatenight #debates #Debates2016
Blow your damn nose you idiotic racist orangutan giant Umpalumpa!  #debatenight
@DrinkingQuest but you have to stay up for the Twitter battles that will take place after the debates
Donald you have no plan if so tell us your plan  He's melting right in front of us #Debates
Trump Shoulda wore a Diaper  I know he shit his pants  #Debates
I'm writing a 15 page memo on evidence instead of watching the debate. I think we know who is having more fun. #debatenight
Trump: "It's legal. I can do it." Hillary: "It's illegal. I'll do it anyway." #Debates
$ is not the NATO problem: the New World Order is. #Debates
He just said so much stupid stuff I can't even tweet it because I just pulled all my hair out.  #debatenight
Again, Trump only cares about Chicago because he has property there. #debates #debatenight
Trump Sucks Hillary Sucks  I get it.  I won't be wasting my time on #debatenight
Hillary's giving us the best sitcom work ever when she looks direct to camera when Donald says something completely insane. #Debates2016
props to hillary for keeping her cool while donald is going crazy 😂😂 #debates #gopopohl
I can't hear Donald Trumps bullshit about taxes anymore get tf off the podium #debatenight
If your too dangerous to fly, then your too dangerous to own a gun! #HillaryClinton #Truth #debates
I swear to god that this is a joke to this dude #Debates
It's been real, y'all.  I'm signing off.  I'll catch the updates on fb.  #Debates2016
Can we get a livestream of Sean Hannity right now? 😂😂😂 #debatenight
@HillaryClinton has waited a year to deliver this salvo. @realDonaldTrump is trying to counterpunch but it's not connecting. #debatenight
Trump and Clinton agree: if you're on the No-fly list, you should not have a gun. #DebateNight
Neither one of them are answering questions directly, get it tf together America #debatenight #Debates
In the criminal justice system, Donald Trump is considered especially heinous. #debatenight
Did no one teach Trump that just because you say something doesn't mean it's true? #debatenight
Trump saying he had just looked at his income figures earlier today is the single most believable thing he has ever said. #debatenight
Lester!! You are pulling a Laur! Wake up. Insert yourself. Cut him off. #debatenight
i have more civilized debates w my kid who can only speak 5 words than trump/clinton
Do Trump supporters not care that he evades taxes &amp; admits to not paying his workers? #debatenight #byebyeamerica #Debates2016
"that's business", "why not" (blame Clinton for everything), "that's called being smart" he's awful isn't he #debatenight
Not up for #debates : the new toilet at the P&amp;H is 💯
Someone who's offended by a tweet shouldn't have nuclear launch codes #debatenight
If Hillary had quit as a democrat, called out crony capitalism and run as an independent, she'd have won this race a year ago. #debatenight
.@realDonaldTrump No foreign policy, no realistic defense policy,horrible temperament. YOU aren't at all qualified! #Debates2016 #ImWithHer
What monosyllabic statements do you think he's writing while HRC talks? #debatenight
"What I say is true and you have to take my word for it!" -- Donald Trump. #debates #Debates2016 #DebateNight
Did we really need this debate? I feel like everybody knows who they're going to vote for at this point.... #debatenight #debates
Guys. @HillaryClinton is looking into the camera a la Jim from The Office. It's happening. #Debates2016
USATODAY: Clinton: "There is no doubt now that Russia has used cyber attacks ... Donald's very praiseworthy of Vladimir Putin" #debatenight…
I don't think he knows that we all know that "No admission of guilt" is bullshit #debatenight
that crowd response to Trump claiming he has a better temperment than Hillary! XD lmao!  #debatenight
NYDailyNews: Lester Holt just fact-checked Donald Trump about stop-and-frisk and the GOP nominee did not accept it #debatenight
It's like watching your drunk deranged uncle trying to read random dictionary entries while riding sporadically in a clown car #debatenight
8NEWS: RT mitchcarrtv: I would actually like to hear two intelligent economists discuss this instead of these two people. #debates #debaten…
@LesterHoltNBC Who cares about Trump's tax returns? He is a man of action! He is a jobs creator! #Debates
I should be studying for my two exams, but instead, I'm watching this idiotic show. #Debates2016
Trump and facts are mortal enemies. Everyday Trump makes it his mission to stab &amp; kill facts, he hates facts #debates
Well now, that wasn't even shade. That was the whole tree. #debatenight
There's a podium missing at the #Debates2016 leaving me not really interested. @GovGaryJohnson should be with them...
I don't really like hillary very much but I like a lot of what she's saying #debatenight
Hillary and Trump are surprisingly respectful when talking about crime and inner-cities. #debates #ImWithHer
Wow. "That makes me smart." well done, proving your arrogance once more. Release the returns. #debatenight
#debatenight ok and what was the point of mentioning ur 10yr old son and his great skill at using computers. Waiting for a tie in #debates
Do you think she believed in building the middle class when she helped Monsanto sue family owned farms? #debatenight
@DarHuddleston You not the only one that the #IRS has attacked i mean audited . #DebateNight #Debates2016 #lockherup
😲 omg and it just got scary #debatenight #lawandorder #😱😱😱 ... I bet @MadisonSiriusXM is going to be good tomorrow!!!!
#NeverHillaryOrTrump The problem is the charges both sides are making are the reason we don't like either one of them.  #Debates2016
Has Trump ever landed his private jet in a third world country? #debatenight
"We are talking about racial healing." @LesterHoltNBC ❤️ Great, then get CONTROL. #Debates2016
Did black on black crime really make its way into this debate smh...#debatenight
lol. this is a mess. i live a couple blocks from this shit. i can't watch anymore #Debates2016 #debates
#debatenight I'm liking her thoughts about police, guns and crime.  Undecided
hi sorry can we discuss black women and the policing of our existence? we're dying too. #debatenight
“I was just endorsed by ICE”  And also by ISIS. So, there’s that. #debatenight
Listening to livestream of #Debates2016 via @twitter while driving the kids around. Watching my 5th graders hovering over it #proudmom
Trump keeps talking and talking and not making sense. Just saying a lot doesn't mean your saying anything. #debatenight
Hillary's 'I would kill you but they are cameras' smile is becoming more and more frequent and we're only 30 minutes in. #debatenight
So... I believe Trump only came to #debatenight with just insults and accusations only. It's been less than a half hr in and I'm calling it.
#debatenight Mann let the questioner ask the questionsss. Both of them need to just answer the questions 😒
IS HE SAYING STOP AND FRISK IS OKAY OMG IS HE KIDDING ME #Debates2016
"It would be squandered, too." Trump doesn't believe in government. Why is he running for President? #debatenight
Really wishing I had the gun right now for every time Trump opens his mouth to "answer a question". #Debates2016
Hillary is pulling out receipts on Donald from 1973. Do your research, boo! #debatenight
"let's talk about race" *Everyone pulls their collar so hard and fast we all travel back in time* #debatenight #debates #Debates2016
She does need email transparency, but stuck on how @realDonaldTrump slams system but when he uses it for benefit, he's "smart" #debatenight
I just wish Hillary would stop talking when she is interrupted. She's just being rude #debatenight #sounlikeable
Trump as Sam the Eagle, and Hillary as Sheba in Broadway's new smash hit! "The Lambastic Showdown of Bitchery" #debates
If Trump has a better temperament and judgement than Hillary we are more screwed than I thought. #debatenight
Stop and frisk was ruled unconstitutional @realDonaldTrump A:"He was a very against police judge." Seriously?? Seriously?? #Debates2016
Stop&amp;frisk way down in New York and so is crime there! #Debates2016 #Cato2016
"you don't learn that much from tax returns" not a great thing to say when everything is pushing you to release them but you won't  #Debates
DJT "I have a much better temperment than she does." Audience laughs. #debatenight
One month left to election, and one major party candidate says he hasn't thought much about NATO. #DebateNight
Does @HillaryClinton look like she's falling asleep? Why does she blink so much? #debatenight
I'm still upset he let her get away with the birther crap 1. Why was it racist ? 2. Your campaign started it in 2008, Hillary. #debatenight
@realDonaldTrump brags about settling racism lawsuit I seem to recall he said his principle was never settle a lawsuit #debatenight
He sure is proud...   And I'm sorry, but what is the cyber? #debatenight
Nazi sympathizer Donald Trump thinks it's OK to not pay contractors for work they've complete and the US should do the same #Debates
#debatenight Ms. Keller would've slapped me if I kept using very very very very bad or good
#debates I am suprised he did not try to sell steaks. He will never release his tax returns. The IRA has already told him he can do it
We need to abolish the Drug War &amp; the Death Penalty, institute a #basicincome and talk Reparations. #debatenight #PresidentialDebate
@HillaryClinton birther comment that launched his political career based on this racist lie! #debates
I take advantage of the laws of the country...I'm over him #Debates2016
So this is about where I have property and where I am building...this man..#Debates2016
See you later, I'm watching an episode of "The Big Bang Theory"! #Debates2016 #DebateNight
Amazingly, I just learned that Hillary only became an adult around 2014.  Who knew?  #debatenight
Lester Holt was shady in how he rebutted #Trump's answer on Obama's birth certificate. He was the one to ask the question about it. #Debates
"Our airports are like a third world country," says #Trump.  But, it's smart not to pay income tax? #DebateNight @KGO810
Here we go, Tax returns. HE'S STILL UNDER AN AUDIT, YOU GUYS! #debatenight
Theory: Kim Kardashian releases Hillary Clinton's 30,000 emails on Snapchat after the #debates 👌🏼
I think @LesterHoltNBC read the wrong notes there when he brought up the #birther issue during race relations segment #debatenight #debates
Moving to the topic of race. Lester Holt mentioning Charlotte and Tulsa #debatenight
Trump just said he'll realize his tax returns when she releases her emails!! #debatenight
Wow. Just get off stop and frisk already @realDonaldTrump. Repetition does not equal truth. Five year olds learn that. #debatenight
Trump talking opening a club with no discrimination as if that is special rather than expected #DebateNight
Trump just threw up in his mouth when he heard debt free college #debatenight
If I'm this tired watching, Hillary should sleep like a baby after this. #debatenight
Whether Trump was against the war before or after the war is a HUGE difference. #debatenight
when will Hillary apologize for how the government stole from us and gave us nothing #debatenight
FINALLY Trump pushes back on Lying Leftist Lester. It's frickin' 2 against 1. Cheaters. #debatenight
#debates hillary said NATO said hell yeah we'll all bully tf out of Afghanistan for something you allowed to happen. NATO is awesome lol
Trump is completely losing it. He's screaming at Lester Holt about his calm temperament. #Debates2016
Trump- I have better judgement and temperament *while shushing the moderator* #debatenight
#debatenight is all over my TL, BBC1 is showing it... may as well watch it even though it's almost 3:30am #USPresidentialDebate
Trump was so good at making Obama produce his birth certificate?? 🙄 #DebateNight
Everything Hillary says helps Trump. Hillary is seriously the worst debater #DebateNight
airports aren't great but to compare that to the plights of citizens of developing nations just shows how removed trump is #debatenight
Did he really just say we need to take guns away from people? Isn't he supposed to be pro 2nd amendment #debatenight
I can only watch this debate in 4 minute increments with a 20 minute break in between so I don't punch my phone thinking it's Trump #Debates
Pray for Patti Doyle 👉Hillary Clinton’s former campaign manager put her life in jeopardy exposing ANOTHER Clinton Lie! #debatenight
Come through shade! Maybe he's not as rich as he claims to be.... #Debates2016 🐸☕️🙈
HIllary has slipped into the, I've had enough of your shit, facial expression #debatenight
"I developed very good relationships over the last ... Little while" what. What?  WHAT? #debatenight
Hey, let's stop talking about racial healing and talk about Obama's fucking birth certificate again. #debatenight
"We got sued for being racist, but we settled, so it's okay!" #debatenight
Real talk tho...why does trump have the post Coke binge nasal drip sniffle? #debatenight #trumpsniffgate
I just want to wake up feeling the way Hillary looks when #trump says something stupid in the debate #Debates2016 #debatenight
i made the mistake of logging on to twitter during the debates, bye
The only good thing to come out of Donald's mouth is how the DNC sabotaged @SenSanders no clap back from that hey Hillary #debatenight
He's saying we need Law &amp; Order, but it's the LAW that's killing us.. #debatenight
You CANNOT compare the shootings in Chicago to the police killings of innocent black citizens! #debatenight
Was that rant about stop and frisk based on a fever dream? #debates
Donald Trump is dumb af thinking the stop and frisk was successful in nyc . All that shit did was racially profile us #debatenight
And that's the way I feel! THATS THE TRUE WAY I FEEL!  -Trump #debates
Turning the birther issue into a racial issue is disgusting Hillary. #debatenight She lies! She's Dishonest! I'm #TeamTrump
Lester gotta be sleep when the timer starts for Donald. He's always well over 2 minutes. Gtfoh! #debatenight #debates
Donald never says "our president" it's always "your president" that's fuckin disrespectful in itself. #DebateNight
Has he ever even been to a third world country? Doubtful.  #Debates
i think trump may have interrupted clinton to say "wrong" like 30 times now #debatenight
"I have common sense!" @realDonaldTrump   Alright @PolitiFact say PANTS ON FIRE for that one   #DebateNight
Just listen to what you heard. - Hillary YES, y'all! LISTEN! #Debates2016
#DebateNight is an insult to the 62% of America that wanted to #LetGaryDebate the real issues. #substance @debates
"I will release my tax returns on November 9th. That's a Donald Trump Pledge™" #debatenight
Fact check: 90% of those profiled under Stop &amp; Frisk were Black and Latino. It was racist. That's the answer, Donny. #debatenight
I Donny believes blowing a boat out of the water wouldn't start a war.  What an unmitigated syphilitic dick. #debatenight
"Take the oil." Ah, colonialism. Really missed the 19th century. Bring back the good old days. #DebateNight
Holy cow. From the guy being endorsed by the biggest FOP. Yeah. We know where your loyalties lie racist. #debates2016
Hey @DMRegister this party is awesome but next time I need popcorn please thank you 🍿 #debatenight
"I don't think top down works in America." @HillaryClinton, ripping into @realDonaldTrump's "populist" facade. #Debates2016
WTF, @realDonaldTrump is still projecting his bigotry onto others? Who told him this was a good idea? #Debates2016
Lester: Stop and Frisk isn't constitutional  Trump: Yes it is Lester: Wait, no--okay, okay it is. Please proceed.  #debatenight
I'm not in the media but I will never call Sean Hannity #debatenight
Hillary talking about charitable like her charity money doesn't go towards her campaign😂 #Debates
All politics aside, Trump is totally unpleasant to listen to. Dude can stop sniffling #Debates2016 #PresidentialDebate
My children are so excited about #Debates2016 They're discussing that @HillaryClinton is "first girl" to run. I feel great about the future.
#Debates Hillary Clinton talking about private prisons being closed is a very important point that doesn't get a lot of play #debatenight
I wish I had a drink right now watching this debate. It's probably a good thing I don't because I would end up dead. #debatenight
listening to Hillary try to lecture someone on mistreating people is laughable  #debatenight
Hillary's temperament?!  She has people killed off when they dissagree with her! #debatenight
"I hopes the fact checkers turned the volume up and are really working hard" -Clinton  #Debates2016    @PolitiFact
"bragadocious" - #debatenight (I need a bigly glass of wine for this vocab lesson)
He's on adderall (sniffs), she took a load of Xanax (slow blinks) #lesseroftwoevils #debates #bored
@realDonaldTrump even the secretary of state  @HillaryClinton had to delete spam occasionally. #debatenight #Debates2016
the fact that so many people are being raised thinking blatant racist, homophobic, and offensive thoughts are okay sickens me #debatenight
Plot twist: Donald Trump is actually broke AF and his face right now is priceless, so we may be on to something here, folks #debatenight
Do I want a nice president or an effective president?  hmmm #debatenight
#Debates2016 @realDonaldTrump THE ONLY BIG FAT UGLY BUBBLE I SEE IS YOU AND YOUR EGO
#DebateNight #Debates2016 STOP AND FRISK IS UNCONSTITUTIONAL THOUGH. @realDonaldTrump STOP TRYING TO MAKE IT HAPPEN. IT WONT HAPPEN #fetch
Beat a dead horse much??  Both of ya!  2 drinks!! #debatenight #DebateDrinkingGame #Debates2016
Kids react to Donald Trump is  a video on Youtube. And it is a delight to watch.  #Debates
Trump: ' I opened a club, a very successful club'..who asked you now?..#debatenight
The color ratio from don don's orange face to his really white hands is scary tbh #Debates
I do enjoy the differences between GOP Twitter and yaaaaas qween Twitter on #debatenight
Here we go bring the fucking emails into the debate can you please bring something else new #Debates2016
Did he just repeat himself about the NRA being good people, or is my tv broken? #Debates2016
Yeah, Donald..NATO is just now in the terrorist business because you've pressured them. #delusional #Debates2016
What the fuck is Trump taking about?  He opened a club? What? #PresidentialDebate #debatenight
Djt on Iraq: "had we taken the oil" or maybe he meant had we colonized the place... #debates2016
If my TV and keyboard survive this debate, we'll be lucky. #angermanagement #debatenight
Fact checkers must be dropping left &amp; right from pure exhaustion #debates
Even if you hate Hilary we all know she's doing well in this debate.  #debatenight
Trump responds to HRC's claims about discrimination suits and says they settled the suit without admitting guilt #debatenight
#Debates2016  HIllary nails Trump on stiffing his workers. Bankruptcy. Paying no taxes.
#Debates2016 Trump's proud of settling race bias in housing suit with "no admission of guilt."
So for trump being #black and #Hispanic are synonymous of poor and uneducated???? #offensive  #debatenight #Debates2016
@realDonaldTrump.... I don't believe it, stop speaking for the African American community or any community of color!#Debates2016
The best person in her campaign probably is the media. Even though she's killing it. #debatenight #Debates2016
Trump is doing so bad I'm actually cringing for him. Nevermind. SAMBA TIME!!!!!!! #debatenight #Debates2016
#debates help me what is this country you are all roasting each other that's all this is.
Can't wait to see the tightrope he is gonna walk on this one #Debates2016  #Debates
Apparently Hillary is against law and order now....? Uhhh Kay.... His baseless rants are too cringe-inducing. #debatenight
HRC: "Everyone should respect the law." Then why are you not being prosecuted? #debates #debatenight #NeverHillary #debate #LawAndOrder
Low key glad Trump brought up Clinton and the DNC working against Bernie #debatenight
Does anyone have Sean Hannity's phone number? We need to call him #debates #debatenight
To be fair, I too am not a fan of Laguardia... #debates
#DebateNight Trump on race is all more racial profiling, take guns away from Black ppl  (white ppl should have guns tho) #TrumpSniffle
Someone on their bed who weighs 400 lbs could've done it! 😂😂😂😂 #TrumpPence2016 #cybersecurity  #Debates2016
You made a mistake and put national security at risk   #Debates2016
There very much is a question over who has better judgement #debatenight
#Trump #DebateNight So, Trump criticized for speaking favorably of Putin. I just saw the movie "Snowden."
Stop and frisk is racially profiling. Don't argue with the man! He called ur dumbass out!  #debatenight
I don't like 1st amendment or the 5th amendment or the 14th. But don't touch the 2nd. -Trump #debatenight
There is not enough wine in the world. This is just a general announcement. Its not related to #debatenight
How can she talk about trust? Americans can't trust her.  #Debates #debatenight
Gotta give props for Hillary spittin' some truth right now. 🙌🙌 #debatenight
T perpetuates the "women are emotionally unstable" stereotype, accusing C of bad temperament while he yells at the moderator. #Debates2016
Trump put in a plug for his new Hotel. Classy. Are the audience members eating his steaks, too? #debatenight
Hillary's Iran deal GAVE nukes to the mad mullahs. Oh, and hundreds of billions of dollars as a side dish.#debatenight

I feel like this debate is like the one between Burr and Jefferson... or I'm just Hamilton trash. #debates
Trump is making it sound like it sucks to be black or Hispanic....it's pretty lit if you ask me #debatenight
#debates #debatenight #Debates2016 Take the oil and leave, that is like asking the U.S. to be in Iraq for another 20 years
Trump claims America is in a big fat ugly bubble  #Debates2016 #JOUR3001
Trumps says ISIS was created in a vacuum made by Clinton and Obama  #Debates2016 #JOUR3001
If only BOTH of our candidates could be polite to eachother #debates
@HillaryClinton Donald has claimed bankruptcy 6 times....how many criminal investigations have you and @billclinton had? #Debates2016
Hush, Lester. Noted constitutional scholar Donald Trump is weighing in now. #debatenight #Debates2016
Pretty sure this is the first time "400 pound fat person" has been invoked in a debate since Taft was in office. #DebateNight #Debates2016
Killarys face when Trump said how much he made in a year LOL her eyes got green with jealousy!!!#Debates
Hillary had a middle class life HA she's even more out of her mind than I thought......#Debates
Tbh I was watching the debate for a few minutes and then I left the room because depression #debatenight
So Lester just going to let them dance all the way around this race issue huh? #debatenight #debates2016
This is the part of the debate where Donald says he loves black people. Wait for it, wait for it. #debatenight #Debates2016 #Debates
Repairing relationships with minority communities does not start with Stop and Frisk. #debatenight
This debate sums up why the rest of the world thinks that the United States is a joke. #debatenight
"I was just endorsed by tons of Admirals, it just happened. Got the notification on my blackberry. Just now. Not lying." #debatenight
Hilary, and her mother, and her mother before her, have been fighting Isis their whole lives #debatenight
Will someone please call Sean Hannity. Let's get Sean in here. Where's Shawn. #debatenight
HRC uses "Latino" where as Trump uses "Hispanic" cuz we all know, we his panic #Debates2016 #yatusabes
Hillary is starting to look like she is going to nod off #debatenight
Hey Hillary, name one #NRA member "gun lobby" who committed mass shooting. #2A  #debatenight #debates #tcot
Yeah, Hillary, Iran getting nuclear bombs is Bush's fault, not yours, not obama's whom signed a deal  #debatenight #debates #tcot
I will release my taxes when the audit is over.... whatever, It will be another 2 years. #Debates2016
"We have got to address the systemic racism in our criminal justice system" #ImWithHer #debates
Trump does have a point. Bringing up him not showing tax returns but Clinton not asked about Emails #debates
Is Trump complaining about people who make money by taking advantage of others? #debatenight #ImWithHer #Debates2016
Wasn't stop-and-frisk Roger Ailes policy with women at Fox News?   #debatenight
Not bragadocious he says? I don't even know how to spell it but #TrumpTrain is it. #debatenight
Congratulations Republican Party....this creature babbling and wasting our time...is your fault. #debatenight
He flusters so easily.  He can't even contain himself to allow her her time to speak as she allowed him #debatenight
When Donald Trump talks about #race can we just agree to replay on repeat him calling all Hispanics rapists? Thanks. #Debates2016
"We shouldn't have been in [Iraq] in the first place." -Trump I'm sorry, are you aware which party you support??? #debatenight
"Could have been a hacker  who weighs 400lbs laying in bed." And hate continues......#debatenight
Hillary Clinton- politically correct presenting compromise Trump: Police do nothing  (WHAT ABOUT BLACK LIVES MATTER???) #debatenight
Trump: "Under President Obama, We Have Lost Control Of Things We Were In Control Of As A Nation..." #debatenight
@LesterHoltNBC have you considered actually fact-checking your candidates? Stand up and MODERATE. #debatenight
He has all the worst words and yells them over and over #Debates2016
Clinton: "I made a mistake using a private email" Trump: "It's more than a mistake, it's disgraceful" #debatenight
@LesterHoltNBC is strong. Letting them go on this e-mail issue is good move. #debatenight
This topic has let the air out of the room. That's troubling. #debatenight
I can't stop staring at Trump's hair! 😂 #debatenight I think I'm mesmerized! 😵
Ask her to TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR BENGHAZI! How can I vote for a liar, someone unable to act on  threats when needed? #Debates
People of all the indignities - getting the President to show his papers. Is this apartheid South Africa  #debates
This is like watching grown up Hermione Granger debating grown up Draco Malfoy. @jk_rowling #debatenight
I think DJT really thinks that if he blinks and says "Nope, murders are up!" they really will be. #Debates2016
Donald Trump has the best temperament, trust me, it's so good he keeps screaming "WRONG!" like he's a 2 year old #Debates2016
"ISIS isn't NISIS", pretty much what Trump has been saying the past few minutes #debatenight
Donald Trump watches reruns of Law and Order to prepare for debates. #debates
"He didn't pay any federal income tax." "That makes me smart." No, it makes you a criminal I believe.... #debates
Trump sure knows how to name all of America's problems, but fails to explain HOW he plans to solve them #Debates
"He may not be as rich as he says he is. He may not be as charitable as he says he is." -HC #debatenight
I'm beginning to wonder if election 2016 is being sponsored by the makers of Xanax. Just Trump's campaign, maybe? #debatenight
Things have gotten worse in our inner cites, because jobs are leaving!  #debates
Trump has done a phenomenal job of not answering the question that was asked. Phenomenal job #Debates2016
He sounds like a child you go first then I'll go #debatenight
don't you get like put in a time out or something if you keep being rude to the moderator? #debatenight
Did @realDonaldTrump just group all hackers as 400lb slobs sitting on a bed? #debatenight
The moderator is getting run over by these two. Where a WWE ref when you need them? #debatenight
For every question Donald Trump is asked, he talks about his companies.. #debatenight
Bro Trump need to take a lie detector test cause the shit he sayin not lining up #Debates
Wow. Trump boasted about being part of the system that led to 2008 recession, now boasts about being 'smart' for avoiding tax. #debatenight
Chicago had 2,000 more murders than New York?? Somewhere, Al Capone is smiling. #debatenight  #Debates2016
Lester is a disaster for this debate.  what a biased hacked. #debatenight
Trump is such an asshole, imagine how terrible he will be to all the people below him. #Debates
Trumps answer to not paying federal taxes: "that makes me smart" ummmmmm #debatenight
Lester Holt to Clinton: "Do you believe the police are implicitly biased against African Americans?" Damn. Great question. #debatenight
You don't get a gold star for refraining from discrimination. That's just being a decent human. #debatenight
#Debates2016 so he hasn't denied not paying taxes. I guess he likes to be honest by omission
#debatenight   Neither is answering questions... Any substance more than same old politics?
Trump: I got sued for being a racist but i was with friends. #debatenight
Fact check: Murder rate up in New York in 2015 - '239 people have been killed this year up from 227 during the same period in 2014' #debates
Most adult Americans have been fighting ISIS throughout there adult life, you IDIOT #DebateNight
Hillary says we need to push ISIS out of the Middle East.  WE NEED TO PUSH ISIS OUT OF THE US. #debates
@HillaryClinton Pretends 2 Be A By-Stander When She Voted On The Iraq War @realDonaldTrump Was A CIVILIAN When We Went In2 Iraq #debatenight
"i have a better temperament than she does" HAHAHAHA okayyyyy trump #debatenight
This level of incoherence is disqualifying. That it isn't for large swaths of country is... Deeply troubling. #Debates2016
Did he just make a non sequitur about his 10 year old being good at computers on cyber warfare question? Of course he did. #Debates2016
#debatenight #debates #Debates2016 why does Hillary say bait and switch she started it... She is imploding
Funding needs to be provided to these police departments for training. Officers need to understand that they're 1st responders. #debatenight
Lol imagine how much better this would've been if Obama was the moderator #debatenight
I would love to know which General and Flag Officers have publicly stated that they are in Trump's camp. #debatenight #bullshit
.@realDonaldTrump Don't talk about the military or ISIS until you can best me on a PT test or rifle range. #IServed #YouDodged #debatenight
@HillaryClinton : accuses Russia of doing some of the hacking. Says @realDonaldTrump praises Russia. #debatenight
"If you are too dangerous to fly, you are too dangerous to own a gun" - @HillaryClinton YES! #debatenight #ImWithHer
"Nobody cared much about it" - @realDonaldTrump you did by spending YEARS denying the legitimacy/legality of @POTUS presidency #debatenight
apparently somehow stealing all the oil in the middle east would have prevented isis. lmao #debatenight
OPENING TRADE HAS CONTRIBUTED TO AN IMPROVEMENT IN THE INTERNATIONAL MARKET   #debatenight
Trump website keeps going up and down. Should've hired Hillary's IT team. Ha! #debatenight
Not sure you can call out NATO on not paying fair shares when you just admitted to not paying taxes... #debatenight
All Hillary has is that condescending smile.   She's got nothing!  @debatenight
Is it me or did Trump almost say that he was endorsed by ISIS??? lol #Debates2016
We are nearly half way through a 90-minute debate and only two topics were covered #debatenight  #OpenDebates
Trump's inadequacy is on full display tonight. Clinton is pensive and in control. It's not even close. #debatenight
OMG HE JUST REFERENCED STOP AND FRISK?!!??!?? #debatenight ---- and now he's fact checking Lester?!!?!?
Debate drinking game: take a shot every time Trump says "tremendous" #debatenight
According to Trump America is being ripped off by every single country in the world....🤔🤔🤔🤔#debatenight #Debates2016
As trump continues to speak he highlights the privilege he was born into #DebateNight #Debates2016
Stop bringing up eachothers past and talk about what you would like to do for our future pls 🙂😊 #DebateNight
Hillary Clinton to Trump: "Join the debate by saying more crazy things." #debatenight
So instead of allowing Americans to hear #GaryJohnson debate, we are given these 2 clowns debate who is the biggest birther. #debates
I am waiting for the audience to start chanting, "Jerry! Jerry! Jerry!" like the talk show, and then Clinton and Trump wrestle  #debatenight
#debates "A very against police judge" Trump. 😳Who talks in this way, that has to communicate with the world😳Are u kidding me😒
Literal ROFL at HRC's reaction to "temperament" thing. Just knocked over the dog. Cody's worried. @CJ__Cregg is just laughing. #debatenight
#debatenight #lie9 #donaldtrump where's that million dollars for you admitting #obama is American You orange fucksicle!
#debatenight  #donaldtrump as someone who tried to give the central park 5 the chair yer the last ahole that should be allowed to make laws.
They're going to kiss at the end, I just know it,  and then the world swallows itself &amp; some deity says, "the aristocrats"  #Debates2016
Did trump just say it makes him "smart" that he didn't pay his taxes? jfc. #debatenight
A lot of people weren't renting to black people, not just us, so it was cool. #debates
It's not his time to talk what part doesn't he understand #DebateNight
Just cause u got The president to  produce his birth certificate doesn't mean your fit to get things done in office😂 bad example #Debates
The worst part is that Hilary might not even be winning the debate #debatenight
Trump has been defensive and now cannot defend himself against what Clinton said concerning his tax returns? Maybe she's right #debatenight
Unfortunately,Trump cannot just calm down to listen to the question&amp;answer it. His mind forms a question&amp;he answers that one #debatenight
Braggadocious is a real word guys !! Definition - "boastful or arrogant" #Debates2016
Speaking of criminal justice systems, why are those 2 not in prison? #JustSaying #debatenight
And now he hates obese people too! Keep adding to the list! #debatenight
Is @realDonaldTrump stiffing his coke dealer like all of his other contractors? #debatenight #Trumpsniffles #breatheDonald
I wish someone would ask him about all of his manufacturing factories are over seas.  #Debates
Hillary keeps calling for fact checks, but yet destroys evidence every time she's under investigation. #debates
The Donald: "It was on this report...that I just saw, believe me*"  *on Buzzfeed  #Debates2016
I think TRump likes saying TRillion cuz it sounds like him #debatenight
Trump's hand moments are incredible. He always looks like he's trying to pinch little bugs out of the air. #debatenight
.@realDonaldTrump is that asshole idiot in your high school who drives a BMW and won't let you forget it. #debatenight
Am I the only one that wants to JUMP IN on this debate?  Geez...  Hilary needs help with this jackass.     #debatenight  🙄
Why does he keep INTERRUPTING HER?  Where's the monitor?  #debatenight
Damn straight about that birtherism crap.  Black folks won't EVER forget what he did.  Believe that. #debatenight
That race is being brought up in POTUS #debates there is no question #blacklivesmatter has been effective. #debatenight #Debates2016
'Had we taken the oil'.... Don't you get it? What right does the US has to take another country's property? #debatenight
#DebateNight #Debates2016 Damn, Trump just said that he stiffed those companies because he could.
You opened a country club in PALM BEACH allowing "all races" to join, therefore u aren't racist?Yea, no. #embarrassedrepublican #Debates2016
He's using his breathy disingenuous voice inflection  I HATE that! only does it when he's talking about POC #NeverTrump #biggot #debatenight
Is Trump ever going to stop denying that he supported the war? #debatenight
Are the fact checkers Hillary keeps talking about the same team she used to delete emails? Asking for a friend... #Debates2016
Is it me or does @HillaryClinton freeze up every once in a while.....like an old robot. #UpdateHerOS #MaybeSomeOil #debatenight
Trump hasn't paid federal taxes - does NOT make you smart, it makes you a jerk ESP if you made $650M #DebateNight
Did Trump just defend the birther movement as a service? Doesn't even pass the laugh test.  #debates
Why aren't these debates done @AroundtheHorn style? The moderator needs a mute button and a points button. Would be just as informative
He's hiding his tax while your under investigation from the FBI? LMFAO WHAT #debatenight 😂
.@realDonaldTrump I'll call @seanhannity if you'll tweet his number.  I have a few things I'd like to ask him. #debatenight #debates
If @HillaryClinton weren't terrible at everything, she could be winning this #debatenight easily.
.@HillaryClinton says “we need to work with the faith community” to restore troubled communities torn by race #debates #debatenight
I keep on waiting for this 'we need law &amp; order' thought to end and see how deep this hole goes... #debatenight #debates
Watching two old white people say the word "black" so much makes me uncomfortable. #Debates2016
#debatewithbernie would be so much better if it was an actual #debatenight w @BernieSanders .  #debates #FeelTheBern
"Typical politician. All talk, no action" Trump says as he cuts off Lester Holt before he can finish asking his question #debatenight
@PattiSolisDoyle @Lg4Lg @HillaryClinton Bullshit! There are videos!You need to dig a little deeper sweatheart your bias is showing! #debates
Hillary appears to be irritating Trump on not releasing his tax returns. #debatenight
ALL I AM DOING IS YELLING BOTH ON HERE AND IRL SOS HELP #debates
Nothing working for Hillary. Fullback up the middle with 8 in the box though? #Debates2016
Neither of these candidates deserve to become the President of the United States #Debates
He thinks he did a good job, asking the President of the United States to produce proof of his citizenship. WOW. #DebateNight
😂 "I have a winning temperament".  This guy... honestly. He's like the Kanye West of Politics. #Delusional #Debates
Hillary Clinton is crushing Trump #Debates2016  He looks unprepared and keeps ranting
The worst part about this is Trump still has a good shot at winning it all #debates
No admission of guilty is not the same as not having guilt. #debatenight
Trump: We have a situation where our inner cities, African Americans and Hispanics, are living in hell. #debatenight #nbc4
So is 10 year old Trump Jr going to be Assistant Secretary of Cyber? #What? #DebateNight
I don't think your estimates mean much Trump - if your track record says anything #debatenight
Only way to watch #debates and not throw things at the TV, is to simultaneously have West Wing on and hope maybe Martin Sheen gets elected.
#debatenight Will Trump ever answer a question?Come on Holt stop this and get him to answer the question.
It's amazing how unreasonable Hillary seemed next to Bernie Sanders, and how reasonable she seems next to Trump. #debatenight #Debates2016
500 murder is a lot of murders. At least we can agree on one thing. #debatenight #PresidentialDebate
This #debate would be way better if this was not real life. Is this real life??? #PresidentialDebate #debatenight
I care too much about the truth and don't care enough about either political party to warrant watching another second of the #Debates2016
Trump's lack of understanding of the constitution is a treat to the safety of security of this Nation   #debates
I don't even know what the issues are because we never get to talk about them 😢 #debatenight
This Hillary bs Trump debate makes me want to cry they are both so stupid #debates
Is anyone shocked that Trump has advocated a violation of international law in a national debate? #debatenight
"If we're actually going to tell the truth" Hillary to Donald #debatenight ooooohhhhhhhh damnnnn
Great strategy Donald, blame the Black President for police shooting Black people.[sarcastic of course] #Debates2016
#debatenight #Hillary Trying to justify the extreme turn up in privatized prison her husband caused.
Never Forget Hillary Is A Pathological Liar (What Sniper Fire) She’ll Cut Taxes For The Top 1% Too! #DNCRiggedThePrimary #GoGreen #Debates
Yeah, Trump really looks like he gives a flying fuck about the middle and lower classes. Fuck off forever #debatenight
I hear anywhere else on the planet is beautiful this time of year #debates #byeAmerica 👋🏼
Donald trumps hair is so big because it's full of lies #debates
Bwhahahahahahaha 😂😂😂 Trump thinks NATO did anything based on anything he said? #debatenight
As usual, enjoying a ridiculous debate. A clear picture of one candidate (prepared &amp; informed) and the other (full of 💩) #debatenight
SHUT. UP. About the fact checkers. You lying liar who lies out your lying lie hole!!!!!! #DebateNight #HRC #HillaryRottenClinton
I take advantage of the laws of the county to screw over as many little people who can't afford to fight back. #debatenight #trumpedup
And came out of college to go under cover to prove housing discrimination... #debatenight #HillYes
My heart stopped for an instant when I thought he said "I'm endorsed by ISIS" then I realized it was "ICE" 💔 #debatenight
We are a nation of laws, not a nation of men. Regardless what your parents told you, LE directives must be followed #debatenight
My business is the most tremendous business out of every business.  Have I told you how much I made yet? #debatenight #debates
How would I promote racial healing? I got @BarackObama 's birth certificate.  I did.  I got it and it was beautiful. #debates #debatenight
@realDonaldTrump why aren't you sure of all the figures you've mentioned? You and your team need to do more research. #Debates2016
This 'Trumped up trickle down' thing is such a crap hook. #debatenight
Does #Hillary have something in her eyes, or is she signaling someone in Morse code? #debate #debatenight
Lester's got about 10 mintues left to #Hillary about: CattleGate ChinaGate FBIGate FosterGate FoundatoinGate Benghazi Emails #Debates  FFS
Hillary's answer on systemic racism was absolutely spot on, but more importantly, convincingly genuine. #debatenight
I can't hold back my opinions anymore! #letherspeak and stop speaking around the questions #Debates2016
Oh and let Trump keep interrupting like the rude jackass he is #debatenight
Trump keeps talking about his companies...but like, just because you're a good business man doesn't make you a good President. #Debates2016
#Debates2016 All Trump can talk about is his hotels. No debate prep showing.
Okay Quasimodo. Drop the right shoulder. It's starting to hurt me. He's panicked. Sniff sniff, swallow, swallow. #Debates2016
Perfect answer Hillary! And he still trying to talk about it. Give it up! #debatenight
The talking about foreign affairs and the question was about homeland terror. Smh #debatenight
@LesterHoltNBC needs to regulate this debate better. They are running over him. #Debates2016
Trump: "I've been all over the place, and you've decided to stay home and that's okay" OHHHHH SHIT HE DIDN'T JUST SAY THAT 😵😵😵 #debatenight
#debates2016 Because he and his party are sooo concerned about the African American community
.@realDonaldTrump lacks any understanding, empathy, concern and value for my experience as a gay, black, latino, male in the U.S. #debates
"I said do you get audited? I get audited. My lawyers, they say don't do it, but I'll do it!" What? Why? I can't. I just can't #debatenight
Mark the time, 9/26/16, 6:42PM, when this debate gave the entire United States of America diarrhea at the same exact time. #debatenight
No wonder CPD @debates didn't allow GreenParty Presidential candidate @DrJillStein. She would have Trounced Both these Clowns! #debates2016
Trump just makes up facts. It scary &amp; comical. I'm laughing while I lay rocking in the fetal position . This can't be reality. #debatenight
If trump becomes president.. I will say sorry to every single American out there because that's straight up torture. #debates #debatenight
If you had paid federal income tax things would have been built.  #DebateNight lol
"I take advantage of the laws of the nation" --Trump  Translation:  "I finesse the system"   #debatenight #Debates2016
Why is the audience there if they have to be silent? #TrumpVsClinton #DebateNight
Trying to make Trump release them by placing imaginary murder in his tax returns #TrumpVsClinton #DebateNight
Lemme hear the bullshit that's about to come out of Trump's mouth on race.. #PresidentialDebate #debatenight #Debates2016
Admitting there is systematic racism is literally the first step every politician needs to take #debatenight
Wait wait, ask Trump to talk more about computers. It's hilarious. #Debates
Nato countries aren't paying their fair share? So.. how about those tax returns? #debatenight
One more, after that one: "You must be out of your GODDAMN MIND" #debatenight
Trump could have pointed out, as Clinton demonized the wealthy, that the Clintons earned $104M on speaking engagements. #Debates2016
Rejoice my fellow African Americans. Donald Trump did us and our black president a great service   #debatenight #debates #ImWithHer
Our airports aren't like any of the third world countries' airports that I've been in... #debatenight
I will be voting in this election . That's the way I'm making a change #HillaryClinton #debatenight
I've been waiting for this debate for such a long time. Trump supporters will finally realize how stupid they are #Debates
For the record the majority of us don't fuck with Trump.  #debates
"As soon as she releases all her 33,000 deleted emails I will release my tax returns." 🔥🔥🔥🔥 #Debates2016
Trump is such a racist pig. He's so damn condescending  to the black community. I just want to slap his face silly. #debatenight
Oh good, doubling down on stop &amp; frisk that didn't work in NYC. Thanks for motivating the Dem base, Donald! #debatenight #Debates2016
So rich people of all races can get into Donald's country club? He is SO in touch with average Americans. #debatenight #Debates2016
It would suck to run for president and then lose bc then you'd literally be the biggest loser in America LOL #debatenight
@BruceWolfChi @AnnaDavlantes @John_Kass @JohnHowellWLS #Debates2016 like trump is not acting like a politician and taking BS like Romney.
Whose fault was spending all that money in the MidEast? Wasn't it Bush? #debatenight
"It's all words, it's all sound bites." - except when it translates into matters affecting lives. #Debates2016 #debate
Still waiting for trump to answer the question about racial divide #debatenight
"We have to get guns out of the hands of people who shouldn't have them"  ...including cops who didn't merit using them. #DebateNight
You know who knew needs to rewarded here? Freakin @LesterHoltNBC -- dude is a saint. #debatenight #debate
#debatenight #debates #Debates2016 #PresidentialDebate   This is so one sided why is this even happening. Worrying.
#debatenight #debates #Debates2016 #PresidentialDebate   Trump: Illegals r murdering ppl with guns  Clinton: Ban guns 2protect from illegals
#debatenight #debates #Debates2016 #PresidentialDebate   Clinton now copying Trump's hand gestures, this is a glove puppet of a human.
It seems that @realDonaldTrump is going to win the US elections over @HillaryClinton #Debates Nice meeting all of you
How can you restore trust in communities with police if it was never there in the first place? #debates
Living in south Florida this is common knowledge when Doing business with trump #debatenight
The audience GASP when Trump talked about his temperament.  GASPED!  I think I heard a few giggles too.  #Debates2016 #debatenight
Hillary could just mug at the camera for the rest of the debate and still win handily #debatenight
First zinger from @HillaryClinton: yes, I prepared for this #debatenight just like I prepared to be President. First blood!
Can't help but wonder if folks understand back and forth right now at #debatenight: cyber war, Russia, China, ISIS, Libya... coherence?
Newark airport isn't fun. But it's NOT a third world country. Can we all agree on that no matter our side? #debatenight
We're talking about Obama's birth certificate in a segment about racial healing, which says everything about race in America. #debatenight
He is literally promoting "stop and frisk" idk how to comprehend this insanity #Debates2016
Hillary Clinton speaking some good 󾓴 — watching Presidential Debates 2016
"I haven't given a lot of thought to NATO" - US Presidential Candidate #debatenight
Hillary is about to fuck up this moment to crush Trump. Who's her debate coach? #debatenight
Wtf is Trump talking about palm beach?? He be making me want to do coke 😳😳 #debatenight
I can't deal with this.  How do you all take this seriously?   #Debates
“Deal with mandatory minimum sentences”  Guess who’s husband signed the legislation for that… #debates
Donald 'The Thirst' Trump is rattled.   Takes more drinks of water.  Dude, are you just nervous or is there something else?  #debatenight
Alright, game over. Going to look for my inaugural ball gown for President Hillary's inaugural galas this weekend. #DebateNight
I swear it sounded like Donald Trump was just about to say "I was just endorsed by ISIS."  #debatenight
,#Trump is correct. Our airports are like a Third World country. Look at my tweets from last week. #Hillary #debatenight #Debates
What we've lost in 2016:   1. Brangelina   2. Faith in humanity #Debates #RIP2016
I'm done with commenting and being surprised with what comes out of this guy's mouth #debatenight 🙃
Now Trump is advertizing his hotels. He isn't running to sell real estate. #Debates2016
What does he mean by "Law and Order"? The TV show? #Debates2016 #ImWithHer
Trump just made a hilarious noise into the microphone! I can't wait for #SNL! #debatenight #ImWithHer
Trump just took credit for NATO focusing on terror? That's hilarious! #debatenight
Omg first Lester Holt fact check. Donald barrels through. Troglodytes cheer. #debatenight
"SOME OF THE GREATEST ASSETS OF ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD." Who has "assets" on their Debate Bingo card? #debates
Ugh why isn't there an independent in this debate? I would love to hear something different than one extreme or the other #Debates2016
@GovGaryJohnson I am boycotting the debates since you and @DrJillStein were excluded.  #LetGaryDebate #LetJillDebate
What does Obama's birth certificate have to do with racial healing? #debatenight
Agreed #faa has no fcuking money @SpeakerRyan UNFUNDED AGENCY #HILLARY LUENS HER POCKET &amp; bankrupts #USA #news #debates @Bill_Orielly
TERRAH!! TERRAH!! WHOS TERRAH AND WHY SHOULD WE FOCUS ON HER?!? TERRAH!!!! #debatenight
He calls Hillary on her obvious politicianness like we'd like to do at home. He's a giant middle finger to the political class #debatenight
You can't have law and order if people don't trust the law...#Debates2016
This guy is just deranged #Trumo #debatenight you're not entitled to your own facts.
Plus we keep getting all of these bridges closed for no reason @realDonaldTrump #debatenight
Based on social media, it appears all of America is extremely drunk right now. #debatenight
Money is definitely power bc Trump should not be in the position that he's in #debatenight
Cyber Security: Making sure no other countries can watch this crap. #debatenight
"He didn't pay any income tax"  "That makes me smart"  #debatenight
He's backed by FOP, generals and border patrol... Yep, groups mostly comprised of white men with guns. #debatenight #sniffles
An example of having the best words. "A very against police judge" #debatenight  #debates
I bet Donald Trump would have even more money if he worked for Advocare. #Debates2016 #debatenight
15 minutes into the #debates and I'm on Amazon shopping for items to update my bunker.
Trump built his real estate career on discrimination and his political career on delegitimizing the first black president. #debatenight
For those saying Hillary is boring tonight - do you need an entertainer as president? Is it settling to want a good leader? #debatenight
Let me clarify that I am pro-Hill, but I'm also pro-finding diversity in our executive office in future elections. #debatenight
I could never be as calm as Lester during this, good job @LesterHoltNBC #debatenight #Debates2016
Why do we put the corrupt liberal media in charge of these debates?
The fact that Clinton can easily keep up with his nonsense to shut it down is proof enough that she's winning this debate. #debatenight
My mom just texted me "I learn more if i mute the taking and just watch body language" about the debate 😂😂😂  #debatenight #Debates2016
"I've been under audit for almost 15 years." That's...not a vote of confidence? #debatenight
"That makes me smart" .. that's gonna come back to bite him, probably. #debatenight
This guy is an empty suit. Made by China. He said nothing! #debates
I want @SenSanders to rappel down from the rafters and tell us this is all just a big practical joke. #Debates2016
If I got a dollar for every time Donald Trump says the term "Law &amp; Order" I would have  as much as the golf course architect #debatenight
Anyone else notice the bragging..lol Investments here, property there. WE GET IT! @realDonaldTrump #debatenight
Does beg the question: If current biz environment is so bad, how is Trump making so much money? #debatenight
Trump: "We should have taken the oil."  Iraq: *giggles wickedly, pouring oil all over naked body* #debates
I am taping Viagra to my clit because that is my only hope to feel sexy again someday #debatenight
Both Hillary and Donald want to get the last word on the topic and it's getting a bit intense lol #PoorLester #debatenight
"The gun epidemic" there is no person behind it. let the robbers out of jail and put the guns in jail #debatenight
Drinking game alert!When Donald Trump, lies, evades a question,doesn't make sense, take a drink. Call ER for alcohol poisoning.#debatenight
Trip has now added a new word to the dictionary...... bigly? #debatenight
Here's my thought for the next debate: every time it's not a candidates turn to talk TURN OFF THEIR MICS. #debatenight
Donald Trump is a man of no restraint and you can tell it's starting to get to Hillary #debatenight
Ok, now America is a 3rd world country, and it's Hillary's fault? #Debates2016
Donald calls Hillary a political hack to her face. Dude has grapefruits  #debates
When Donald uses the word bigly, it's a dead give away he  doesn't know what he's talking about. #debatenight
Everyone release everything pls. Goldman Sachs speech transcript, tax returns, whatever. Earn our freaking trust. #debatenight
Proper genuine smiles from #Hillary dont think i've ever sent that - she knows she is smashing him #debatenight
You got to ask yourself, why won't Hillary release the transcripts? #debatenight
Our AIRPORTS ARE LIKE A THIRD WORLD COUNTRY omfg he said that #debatenight
Trusting @HillaryClinton with cyber security is like trusting Colonel Sanders with guarding a chicken coup. #DebateNight
STOP TALKING ABOUT THE BIRTH CERTIFICATE. Donald was (is?) a birther, and is lying about Hillary. #debatenight #ugh
#debates HE SAY THE POLICE ON HIS SIDE BECAUSE THAT KNOW #TRUMP WANT TO KILL BLACK IN PUT US BACK IN #slavery
That audit is taken no one HELLUVA LONG TIME. Erasing Putin as dependent takes a lot of erasers. #debatenight
He always finds a way to talk about his businesses. Lol  #debatenight
Trump's level of idiocy, and ignorance is surreal.   Hilary's ambiguity, and pandering is unbearable.  Spoooooky future. #debates
This question was about Trump's taxes. Look how far he has diverged from that. #debatenight
Waiting for Ashton Kutcher to pop up any moment now to let us know we're being punked....#debatenight
DT: "I get audited every year, because conspiracy." Because you're a crook. "What about HRC's emails?" #debates2016 #debatenight
#debatenight how do I cover the right side of the screen ????
Tax returns... While we're on the subject of things that matter to all of us watching. 🙄 #Debates
"Settled with no admission of guilt." That's not a good thing, Donald. #debatenight
"We should have taken all the oil" all of it? Out of the ground? #debatenight
illegal immigrants like half of Trump's family should be sent back #debatenight
The Donald just put on an infomercial about his golf property in Palm Beach during the debate.  That has to be a 1st.  lmao #debates
"The security aspect of cyber" @realDonaldTrump speaks like a 14 year old russian hacker #debatenight @HillaryClinton
"I have a great temperament" said with the most assholish body language and voice inflection. Classic Trump. #debatenight
"The security aspect of cyber is very, very tough and maybe it's hardly doable," @realDonaldTrump says of cybersecurity. #debatenight
Then I guess Ted Kennedy wouldn't have been able to buy a gun since he was on the terror watch list!! #debates  #debatenight
Of 90 min of debate, Trump has spent 45 min talking about how rich and successful he is. #Debates2016.
Hill didn't come to play!! Never been more proud of my candidate than tonight! #debatenight #ImWithHer #BurntheDebateStage
Glad I didn't choose to play a drinking game with this. #debatenight
Getting lots of DMs from some of you people. To be clear, I did NOT hack the DNC.  #ThatIsAll #Debates2016
The increase in mental health issues is due to the failure of #obamacare to provide GOOD healthcare #debatenight #debates #Debates2016
Honestly, listening to him is like trying to follow a story my 4 year old is telling me. #incoherent #debatenight
A debate about NYC shit. Fuck you St. Louis, Chicago, Phoenix, Denver, Orlando, Milwaukee. These are the elites. #debatenight
HOLY SHITBALLS HE JUST RETOLD THE SHIT STORY ABOUT THE BIRTH CERTIFICATE AND TOOK CREDIT?!?  He sounds moronic. #debatenight  #debates
#debatenight @realDonaldTrump uh, settling a suit and not admitting guilt is part a settlement.  Uh, that doesn't mean you weren't guilty
"This isn't racial profiling, it's taking guns away from BAD PEOPLE." Through racial profiling. Okay. Got it. #debatenight
@realDonaldTrump @CNN @HillaryClinton #debatenight  #debates ... this has been painful... PAINFUL... I'm embarrassed to be an American
I don't know (what's going on) Maybe (I should stop watching) Who knows?  Yep. Feeling about the same about this. #Debates
You should have been at home getting ready for this debate instead of running around the urban area looking like a fool #debatenight
@SEIU @HillaryClinton she been in politics for decades-&amp; she's now just going to do this? BS #hillary #trump #debatenight
Lester can rail Trump but let's lying #hillary say whatever she wants. #deplorable #debatenight #Hillary2016 #trumppence16
@GovPapa not criminal culture - that exists everywhere. Toxic gun culture is unique to the US. #salsgov #debatenight
@GovPapa every other developed nation with gun controls does not have problems on the scale of the US #salsgov #debatenight
I know I'm tired but did @realDonaldTrump just say he was endorsed by Isis? #debatenight His team should tell him to slow down &amp; articulate.
#Debates Mr.Drumpf on the record means it's on video/ audio you stating you were for the war in Iraq!
He's going to get to Penn ave by a hotel down the road. Like a monopoly game!   @ZerlinaMaxwell @jess_mc @creynoldsnc #imwithher #debates
@AlexKSun this debate reminds me of a drunk person trying to walk a line. Sometimes on it, mostly not. #hhsmw #debatenight
"I haven't given lots of thought to NATO" - your possible future president #ImWithHer #Debates2016
Dude in Charlotte had a gun that was cocked and ready to fire. Just sayin #Charlotte #debatenight
He's like a sleepy toddler throwing a fit.  Thinks his temperament is better than Clinton's. Your rant proved otherwise.#jeez #debatenight
My platform is Jobs Jobs Jobs. Hiring smiley people. Free trade with Unicornlandia! #Debates2016 #debates #makeamericahappyagain
Does Trump want to be President?  I don't think so.  #debatenight
Now he's attached the new York times. All he does is attack and doesn't listen.  #debates
Free college?  Who pays?  The businesses in Mexico?  #Debates2016 #hillaryishigh
Bill Clinton sent more African Americans to jail. Hillary said that all black youth ere criminals     #Debates
Hillary your friend who donated money to you is one of the biggest terrorists #Debates
Hillary attacked Obama but BETRAYED OBAMA by LYING not to use her post as SEC OF STATE  to obtain donations to her foundatin.  #Debates
Drinking each time they take serious shots at each other, may be drunk by the end of this debate... #debatenight #PresidentialDebate
Donald Trump bragging that he settled racial discrimination without admission of guilt instead of denying racism. #Debates2016 #debatenight
Put your billions where your mouth is! Where's your tax return! #DebateNight
Face it, we will all be much happier tomorrow when the 'Bad Lip Reading' version of this debate comes out. #debatenight
College debt free?  What ever happened to working for what you want? #Debates
What kind of war are you trying to start? And between which countries? #debatenight
Why have you been under audit for 15 years, @realDonaldTrump? I think that's the real question. #debatenight
earnest tweet: the cheers in this bar when Hillary said I prepared to be president gave me chills #debatenight
So is anyone fact checking if these "Wrongs" he keeps yelling are actually wrong yet? Pls RT thanks!  #Debates
#debatenight  Trump is unraveling.. Hilary is looking in the camera like "y'all gonna just sit there watching this guy lose it.."
Father God and Sweet Baby Jesus, we are living in our last days. Please watch over your children #debatenight
Hillary is looking at him with disgust. He won't show his tax returns until she shows hers. What kind of games is he playing? #debatenight
Quote of the night: "I also prepared to be President of the United States." #Debates2016
Trump saying other countries don't pay their fair share into NATO shortly after basically admitting he doesn't pay taxes. #debatenight
Gonna be tons of "BIASED!"/"LAMESTREAM MEDIA!" from Trumpetters after tonight, bc of Holt's (totally needed) follow-ups #debatenight
Rather ironic for Trump to be talking about a "big fat, ugly bubble". #debatenight #Debates2016
@HillaryClinton on @realDonaldTrump and the #Birther movement calling it like it is: "racist lie" #debatenight
Its drugs not guns that is the epidemic. Dumb bitch Clinton #debates
Define bad people DT! You just talk and talk but nothing substantial and not really detailing your plan.  #debatenight
Shout out to the poor Trump properties that are truly suffering in Chicago at this moment #debatenight #debates #Debates2016
Clinton questions Trump's business practices and the many employees who he didn't pay for their services. #debatenight
It's like watch a Professional-Softball-playing Aunt getting beaten in a T-Ball game by her 4-year-old nephew on meds. #debatenight #debate
I made him produce his birth certificate. = I made a non-issue an issue and proved it was a non-issue. #debatenight
Can someone please take the two-year, throwing a tantrum, off stage? #debatenight #debates
Has Donny ever taken responsibilty for anything besides bagging foreign "models" who barely speak English? #Debates2016
Trump just can't drop this "Stop and Frisk" argument. He don't have nothing else 😂😂😂 #debates
TRUMP CAMPAIGN MANAGER: if you yell loud enough they'll just drop it, doesn't matter if it's fact.  TRUMP: Lol ok this is wild. #debates
Okay but trump what about YOUR bad plans and YOUR bad decisions ???? #debatenight
Here we go neither one uas anything to say about race relations they will never get it so just move on. Next question! #Debates
Hey D J trump I am not living in hell.  #Debates
Trump you should have stayed on her about that super predator comment #Debates
I feel like I'm watching one of my old nuns from school debate a used car salesman. How did we get here America? Damn. #debatenight
Hillary is quick to ignore that comment about the deleted emails and get back to @realDonaldTrump's tax returns.  #debate2016 #debatenight
Last time I was up at dawn for #politics was @POTUS swearing, now @realDonaldTrump @HillaryClinton #Debates
TRUMP: "Admirals and Generals endorse me. With many more to come."  Umm, ok. #debatenight
#debatenight if he doesn't pay taxes and he is winning the audits, he is following rules.  Smart not dumb
Fact Check: The United States could not have possibly "taken the oil" from Iraq and Libya #debatenight
#debatenight Wrong. He was never sued in 1973. That lie has been debunked.
"I have property and jobs are cool and we need to stop ISIS and we should all cyber and show us those emails." - Trump #debatenight
"Should a man provoked by a tweet have his finger anywhere near nuclear codes?" NO. #debatenight
Bitch this is not a debate this is a shade festival. "And I prepared to be president" #debatenight
"Over the last LITTLE WHILE I've built relations with the African American community" #debatenight
People you aren't allowed to applause even if it means Hilary has to prove her corruption #debatenight
#debatenight  look out Hiliary looks like she is about to fall asleep #debateTrumpWINS
Clinton addressed Trump's attack about as smoothly as anyone could have and silenced any attempt of a response. Nice. #debatenight
Hillary talks. Me: 😵  Trump talks:  Me: 😭  #debatenight: 😵😭😵😭😵😭
Discussing the debate with my dad:  Me: *frustrated with Trump* Him: "if Bill doesn't jump up there and throat punch Trump..." #debatenight
If this debate cant prove to people Trump is nuts nothing will. These debates are the last chance.
I'm lost Trump supported the Iraq war and said so on Howard Stern soooooo why does he keep saying he didn't #Debates #DebateNight
Clinton is showing she can deal with any asshole, folks. Think well USA, think well before you vote...  #debatenight #Debates2016
Trump just denied that stop and frisk was ruled illegal in New York for racial profiling #debates2016 #stopandfrisk
Hillary over here speaking truth on systemic racism... Go on, now!!! #debates
"we need to move on." The most ignored statement. #debatenight poor Lester...😂😂😂
I wish Funk Flex moderated debates. We need some bombs for key moments. #debatenight
Can anyone actually imagine our next four years if this man becomes president? #debatenight
Trump is worried he won't get credit for something...doesn't he take credit for everything?  #debatenight
Since when does "really well" become a factor for determining business success? #DebateNight #DumpTrump
If @TomiLahren and @Liz_Wheeler were watching the debate with me right now, my life would be complete. #DebateNight
Only hope is Donald Trump is scaring the shit out of young people right now. #debatenight
"We have to go after Baghdaddy" Hillary, please. Not on national tv. Save that for the bedroom. #debatenight
.@HillaryClinton: I have a feeling that I'm going to be blamed for everything by the end of this evening @realDonaldTrump: Why not? #debates
Murders up or down in Nyc? Anybody know? Agreed to disagree? #debatenight #debates
@realDonaldTrump has a winning temperament? Are you freaking kidding me? He is delusional!! #debatenight #NeverTrump
Why trump acting like he care about mexicans &amp; blacks. For the fucking people smh. #debatenight
CONTRACTS ARE A FICTION MONEY IS A FICTION I HAVE STOLEN ALL THE MONEY IN THE WORLD I CARE DEEPLY ABOUT THE AVERAGE AMERICAN #debatenight
Which is worst deal?  Nafta?   Iran?    #Debates2016
funny how he turns the gun issue from police brutality to gangs #debates
@realDonaldTrump  OBAMA IS NOT IN THIS DEBATE. STOP TALKING ABOUT HIM. #debatenight
Dear Lester Holt, you suck at this moderating thing. You clearly let Trump go off on tangents &amp; give him more time.  #debatenight
American privilege is killing millions in Iraq and still failing to pronounce the name of the country properly. Iraq not Irack #debatenight
😂😂😂I can't! This is beyond surreal OMG, he's crazy! Even Hillary's laughing #debatenight
As an undecided voter I could care less about his tax returns... that's not what is going to sway me one way or the other... #Debates2016
Stop and frisk didn't pay for more playgrounds teachers or new roads. #fact #debatenight
Is it just me or is Hillary a horrible public speaker? So choppy and zero flow between sentences #debatenight
To quote Bernie Sanders: "Nobody cares about your goddamn emails!"  #debatenight  #Debates2016 #ImWithHer
"Restoring trust" between black people &amp; the police assumes that trust ever existed. Nah. #DebateNight
"Taking people out" does not work. It has not worked. It will not work. Lets take out ideas and not people. #Debates
Who the fuck is Ice? Is that the leader of one of the street gangs roaming the streets? #Debates2016
$650 million in debt. Damn.  Also, how does a man pay zero taxes?  How can he enter the white house?  #debatenight #Debates2016
I'm not a huge Hillary fan, but even I can see Trump doesn't deserve to share that stage with her. #debatenight
He doubled down on getting shot walking down the street. I'm not drunk enough for this #debatenight
@S_Absolem he is simply bullshitting his way thru ..and screaming when it doesn't work #debatenight
The presidential debate is the best show in town, no matter which town you live in. #Debates2016
Hillary is so scripted it is like she is just reading her most popular tweets of the last 30 days.  #debatenight
The Donald trump on the hot seat 😃😃😃. Secretary Clinton making him hot ♨ ♨  #debatenight
Although most of my friends are busy putting deer or bee faces on Hillary/Trump I'm glad that they are at least watching the #debates 🐝
About damn time!! Finally someone has balls to state the white privileged going on! #debates #Debates2016
90 minutes is about right ... they are both out of gas.  #debates
Who else is on the ballot besides these two????? Gotta be someone else..... — watching Presidential Debates 2016
Trump just said "semi-exact" - pretty sure he made up a word 😂 #Debates
Trump says stop &amp; frisk has helped reduce murders... says it was very effective in New York @13NewsNow #debates2016
His face is saying "I can't believe you're making me listen to a woman. I just legit can't get over that" #debatenight
I'm disgusted every time Trump talks about his "investments" in places like Chicago and Charolette. #DebateNight
When I attempt to write 'Bigly' my phone wants to change it to 'Bigot '. So. #debatenight
Trump: we shouldn't allow US firms to move jobs overseas...but we should reward companies that did so in the past. #debatenight
Recap: the Fed sucks, Congress sucks, the President sucks, judges suck, generals suck, etc. If only 1 person had full control. #debatenight
Lester Holt, you can tell him not talk... we're all rooting for you man!! #Debates2016
Hillary's rebuttal was good. We're in debt because of tax evading companies. #debates
Race was the #1 discussed topic on Facebook over the last month. #debates2016
Some of my best friends made in the last 6 months are black! #debatenight #debates
I think the next debate moderator should be someone like John Cena. Just drop bows on them when they act like children. #Debates2016
c y b e r   e v e r y t h i n g  #debatenight
Would have paid UFC PPV $ to watch Trump getting his ass whipped vs Obama debate.  #debatenight
TRUMP DONT SPEAK ON CHICAGE WHEN YOU WONT EVEN TRAVEL THERE  #Debates
#Trump's not smiled yet, but will MSM say HRC didn't smile enough? #debatenight #debates
My brain hurts. 3000 shootings killed 4000 people in Chicago. Thems some powerful bullets. #debatenight #Debates2016
I'd be hilarious person to debate with. My facial expressions are all over the place. I have no poker face #DebateNight
Trump vs Clinton #debates is a as full of laughs as it is full of shit.
I didn't know that the candidates were doing a drinking game on stage. #debatenight
I have a normal laugh, &amp; then I have a gleeful yet maniacal snicker that only emerges when I read Twitter during the #Debates. #DebateNight
Trump &amp; Hillary have been watching makeup tutorials in preparation for this level of glam. #debatenight
Let's talk about federally legalizing marijuana for recreational use, huge tax boost, job creation, GDP Booster #DebateNight
HILLARY'S STAFF HAS TO PLEAD THE FIFTH BC LITERALLY EVERYTHING THEY DEAL WITH IS CLASSIFIED. ugh. make this stop. #Debates
It's like someone stuffed bites of information in his head and now they're all falling out, out of order. #debates
@wkamaubell Do you think Trump is getting coaching from team? He keeps looking quizzically as if he's getting some kind of signs? 😡#debates
LGA sucks = America is a third world country. What in the actual fuck. #Debates2016
"Cyber security is very hard" let me sit down before I snitch on myself #debates
What the fuck is happening right now? Am I having a stroke? how the hell is this a presidential debate? #debatenight #debates
Trump keeps telling people they are wrong. NO SIR, YOU DON'T KNOW BASIC FACTS! #debatenight
So, on a question about race relations you go straight to talking about bringing back law &amp; order.  #ok #smh #debatenight
"We need Law &amp; Order. That's why I'm proposing the resurrection of Jerry Orbach." - A campaign promise I could get behind. #debatenight
It's entirely possible that Trump's 400 lb. hacker comment was a burn on @ThatKevinSmith in Live Free or Die Hard. #debatenight
Trump really wants to see a new season of Law and Order #debatenight
THERE ARE NO COMMERCIAL BREAKS. AND THE BATHROOM IS SO FAR AWAY #debatenight
This is so weird anybody cheerfully stating how middle class they were is she the woman from keeping up appearances  #debatenight
And here we come to the Nuremberg part of the debate #debatenight
The guy who doesn't want to show his tax returns thinks it important that president shld produce a birth certificate  #debatenight
@DrJenGunter He "won" the Republican debates against a bunch of men; his popularity goes deeper than sexism.
Oh my gosh who cares? They need to tell us what they are going to do! #Debates2016
Hillary have you heard of the 2nd amendment? You are not getting my gun!  #debatenight
Hillary taking gulps in panic- she sees her stories falling apart lol! #Debates2016 #debatenight
Now Hillary rolls out the big stinger: “Maybe he’s not as rich as he says he is…” #Debates2016 #DebateNight
“It’s all words” says Trump. And as we know, he “has the best words”… #Debates2016 #DebateNight
“I take advantage of the laws of the nation” to, well, not pay people when they work for me. #Debates2016 #DebateNight
How bout Clinton stops making jokes and smiling and take thing seriously? That's why I'm all in on trump #debatenight
Is he only gonna drop this emails bomb?? Is that all he has?  #debatenight
Hilary is cool, calm &amp; collected like she had an extra large Xanax smoothie before going on stage and I respect that. #debatenight
Our forefathers would be so proud of this atrocity that they've created #OneOfThemCouldBeOurPresident #debatenight #LiterallyCrying
Trump has no idea what our current first use policy is, so he's just talking random shit. #debatenight
I really relate to @LesterHoltNBC's "we need to move on" at the #debates
.@HillaryClinton speaks to Donald's refusal to release his taxes. @realDonaldTrump says, verbatim, "that makes me smart" #ImWithHer @Debates
"We've got to address the systemic racism in our criminal justice system" -@HillaryClinton YES. THIS. #Debates2016
Umm hi. Let's stop comparing airports and start comparing quality of life and economy. #Debates2016 #debatenight
I really hope someone autotune's a song by Trump called "Murders Are Up." #debates
#HofstraDebate, #Debates2016, #debatenight  So Hillary, ask your Secret Service to disarm and see how long they stay!
We couldn't stay in Iraq without putting our troops in danger of being prosecuted. Facts are facts. #debatenight
I just want to know why Donald Trump disbanded the USFL #debatenight
Wealthy people deserve tax cuts too. Never met a poor person who created jobs.  #debatenight
remember back in the day when Cybering was sexting via Instant messenger? no....? just me... ok nvm.... #debates
I hate how trump keeps speaking over her it's so rude #debatenight
Funny to see the real @realDonaldTrump showed up for #debatenight and not the fake "Presidential" his supporters wanted him to be tonight.
&gt;we need more second chance programs  Yeah so they can do it again #debatenight
Here he goes . Generalizing my whole race because of a few groups of people. Great .... #debatenight
What was the point of the war if you don't TAKE THE OIL?  Trump really understands the Halliburton foreign policy manual. #debatenight
"If your main claim to being president is your business...your business is built on the back of little guys." -C #debatenight
I'm laughing right now because my face has become incapable of expressing as much rage as it wants to. #debatenight
DONALD'S ENTIRE CAMPAIGN IS FOUNDED ON THE RACIST BELIEFS OF HIS SUPPORT BASE, THIS IS NOT NEW. #debatenight
"DONALD HAS CONSISTENTLY INSULTED MUSLIMS ABROAD AND AT HOME WHEN WE NEED TO BE COOPERATING WITH THE AMERICAN MUSLIM COMMUNITY" #debatenight
Translation of all Trump statements... "$$$$$money, money, everybody should pay us/me, money, $$$$$" #Debates2016
@realDonaldTrump needs one of those electric dog collars. We can zap him every time HE TALKS OVER @HillaryClinton #DebateNight #IMWITHHER
Blah blah blah whine whine whine blame blame blame. Trump's debate strategy. #debatenight
Trump seems to be attempting the rarely used "eating your own dick" tactic in this debate. #debatenight
@RandyOrton @Chilis  Football &gt; #debates  And way to be a snitch and tag his employer.
You don't have to talk down to anyone to get a message across. More facts, less bullying. #debatenight
You know it's bad for The Donald when Hillary even has better punchlines #debatenight
"We settled that lawsuit with no admission of guilt." vaguest answers possible. #debatenight
I don't even know what question they're supposed to be answering right now.  #Debates
I want to see the next #debatenight moderated by Jon Stewart. Please.
Trump just said that the USA has 'become a third world country'. ??????? #debatenight
If she starts using his middle name he's gonna have flashbacks to when his nanny used to yell at him. @pattonoswalt #Debates2016
No, Donald. Avoiding paying your taxes is not smart. I'm pretty sure it's illegal and dishonest. #Debates
Stop and frisk is NOT the solution... and never will be! #debatenight
Fuck the election let's get started carving Trumps face on Mount Rushmore ASAP!!  #Debates2016
Still have not heard a plan from Hillary on how to create jobs.  #debatenight
Hillary's performance at Benghazi makes her completely untrustworthy as  commander in chief. #Debates2016
Really? Running on a platform of racist policies? This got Germany in trouble. #Debates
He acts like ISIS is walking around with signs on their heads~he'll just send people in to get them #easypeasy #debatenight
Crowd laughs AT HIM when he says he has a better temperament. #ImWithHer #debatenight
Did Donald Trump just admit that he hasn't paid any income tax I years? That's what I heard.  #debatenight
@yea_its_shay I'm listening.. the sniffs sound like his nose is running big time.. #Debates2016
Trumps plan to combat gun violence is simple, as he says ad nauseam: "We just have to restore 'law and order'". #debatenight
Trump just agreed w/Clinton on the "no fly, no buy" list.  #debatenight
Hi @realDonaldTrump raising your voice &amp; constantly interrupting everyone won't make your points remotely successful #debates
Doesn't matter who you vote for if you poor you will stay poor. #debatenight
It can't get any worse - not about the destination but about the journey #Debates2016
did trump just say we came up with the internet, i believe that was the UK's tim burners lee #debatenight
Me and @LesterHoltNBC sitting in a tree because FACT CHECKING IS BEAUTIFUL &amp; I'm in love with him now #debatenight
this is fun to watch because i hate both of them. so when they start arguing, i'm agreeing with both sides 😂 #debates
I'm sorry #DonaldTrump, but #stopandfrisk won't bridge the gap between minorities and police, it'll make it worse. #debates
Is Trump advertising his properties again? His club in Palm Beach? #debates #teamrhetoric #trdw
Trump just told all 400+ lbs that he doesn’t care about their vote. #debatenight
I've had to use the rest room for the last 45 mins but this shit show is entertaining #DebateNight
So if a company doesn't like an employees work to the fullest, they don't have to pay them? @realDonaldTrump #Debate2016 #DebateNight
Stop and Frisk cannot be defended Trump is falling into -Guiliani's trap.  #Debates
The NRA and FOP have completely different legislative goals on gun policy. A fact often not covered. #Debates2016
How did we let it get to this? I am so sad that this is our country. What are we doing? #debatenight
Blowing up a ship wouldn't start a war?  A gun shot, an assassination started WWI. #Debates
If I have a child within the next 8 years they'll mostly be mixed race. Race is a very important to me so can we please talk it #debatenight
Trumped up tricked down is such a dumb phrase. She needs to find some new material. #Debates2016
Trump continues to hit on Clinton's experience, says there's no action. #debatenight @WOKVNews
Lester Holt finally comes out and asks a follow up on the tax returns &amp; audit nonsense #debatenight
#Trump says that 'stop &amp; frisk' diminished the murder rate in NYC. An evidence-free claim. #PresidentialDebate #debatenight
Oh Trump, I agree with Hilary on stop and frisk being racist and unconstitutional.  Not that he is deliberately being so #debatenight
Solution for Isis point out the accounts and encourage counter debates and counter opinions, talk/debate not bring them here! #debatenight
Losing a cybersecurity debate against Donald Trump should be a crime against humanity. #debatenight #Debates2016
#Debates2016 He has no restraint and cannot stop interrupting! YES! Who hasn't DT paid?
WAIT. They should at least be paying us? HE doesnt pay! He cannot be us. Us is people who pay taxes. #Debates2016
ALSO, CAN EACH CANDIDATE JUST TALK ABOUT THEMSELVES? This attacking style of debating is not . . . okay? Ever. #Debates2016
And let's not forget him calling for the execution of the Central Park 5...who were then found innocent. 😒 #Debates2016
The only snapchats I see tonight are filters on trump and Hillary's face.... Sums up this election. #DebateNight
I'm now wondering how many 400lb hackers there are in the world.. 🤔 #debatenight #debates
@JeremyPressley is in the den, watching #debatenight, &amp; I'm over here, reading #ArnoldPalmer tributes in the bedroom. Who wins the nite? ME.
Congrats, @Reince, you've sent out the JV QB against the varsity defense for game one. This is hilarious. #Debates2016
PBS, I think your contrast is off, The Don isn't as orange as usual and I'm worried he might be sick. #Debates
Trump is talking about major tax cuts for the 1%. Both the Dems &amp; GOP have a history of tax cuts for the wealthy. #OccupyTheDebates #debates
When she said "who disagrees...?" It was reminiscent of "what difference does it make?" #debatenight
If we're gonna be subjected to more debates like this, someone should legalize pot nationally ASAP
if i hear one fucking pundit say trump won this debate, i will lose my faith in humanity... #debates
Trump's tax returns are now Hillary's Goldman Sachs speeches: we'll never see either of them #debatenight
Did he just say "bragadocious"? Is he the douchebag Mary Poppins? #debatenight #STFUDonny
Maybe we should start holding people accountable &amp; to the same standards that we hold Fire arms. #debatenight
Hillary's plan to close the race gap has officially got me voting for her. Bring on the Criminal Justice reform!@HillaryClinton #debatenight
#debatenight Republicans go in and start it but the other side gets blamed. Classic @realDonaldTrump revisionist history blame game!
Shouting off about your net woryh really shows the depth of your policy knowledge @realDonaldTrump. Oh wait! It doesn't #debatenight
Don't even start backtracking on the Birtherism comments @realDonaldTrump. We all know what you did #debatenight
Insane as this clearly is, I realize that his "uneducated white males" bloc are probably sitting home cheering obliviously... #debatenight
He turned the race segment into the crime segment, and she fell right into it. #debatenight
ISIS was formed in 2004, long before @POTUS and @HillaryClinton took the reigns #Debates2016
You may be sick of this presidential race but you really can't help but watch the #Debates2016  THIS is what it's come to. #isitajokeyet
"Systemic racism" - #Hillary said it! And the end of private prisons #debatenight
Republican policies are responsible for the vast majority of our $20 trillion debt. That is a fact. #debatenight #Debates2016  #Debates
If my grandpa's scrotum could make facial expressions, they'd look like trumps face. 😕 #debatenight
But if you can release them while under audit, why don't you? #debatenight #debatenight2016
Ugh Trump is just going on and on without anything to say without any substance or pushback  #Debates
We teach kids not to bully -- shouldn't our future commander in chief follow that rule too?? #Debates2016
Oh shit! Lester just called him out on the audit bullshit! And yet he's still talkin around his taxes. #Debates2016
So Trump thinks he can say he has a lot of money without releasing his taxes and we are supposed to blv it🤔 #debatenight
We have to nuke Russia! They can't be allowed to release Hillary's secrets!!!   #debates
so just to confirm @HillaryClinton , you still haven't found those emails? fantastic. #debatenight
Deciding on a candidate this election is like choosing which STD you'd rather get. #debatenight
okay I'm finding it harder and harder to laugh at this every minute #debatenight
...whatever Ailes charged @realDonaldTrump for debate prep, it was too damn much. But given Trump's history on paying ppl... #Debates2016
"Law and order" is probably the most generic solution Trump could've offered #debatenight
I don't care about the emails I don't care about the emails I don't care about the emails I don't care about the emails #debatenight
#debatenight Clinton Opens the segment and gets to close the segment great job #LesterHolt
The moderator just fact checked Trump, on air, and he continues to tell the same fucking lie! #debates
Trump: "I can't take anything off the table" Me: You never put anything on the table. #Debates2016
Could you imagine trying to convince #Trump to take Coral Way instead of Bird Rd? #debatenight
Would really love to see a word graph of the #Debates2016 for each candidate.
Apparently .@HillaryClinton has been fighting ISIS all her life... according to the Trumpster #debatenight
Hillary makes good pt. about implicit bias not being solely a problem for policing #debatenight #racism
Hillary Clinton is debating the drunk guy at the end of the bar. #debatenight #Debates2016
Trump: "We need Law &amp; Order!" Dad: "Season 18 just started tho! Dad joke!" 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 #Debates2016 #debatenight #debates
I'm convinced Trump wants to be president just to watch the world burn.  #debatenight
And the man's biggest concern is what the country's airports look like...#DonaldTrump #debatenight #Debates2016
#debatenight    Braggadocious.   Had to look up the spelling but even if I don't know how to spell it, I'm adding it to my vocabulary.
Why is #Trump talking about NATO nations not paying their fair share after admitting not paying his taxes earlier? #Debates
He knows a lot about not paying your fair share. @realDonaldTrump is a mess. #debatenight
stop and frisk was in NYC what about the rest of America?? #Debates
A good sight when someone want to cover up - keep talking non-stop #DonaldTrump #debates
Love that the moderator APPEARS to realize that Trump's just hanging himself with these rants and ramblings .... #Debates2016
The way I feel about #debatenight is the same way I feel about #MNF rn. I hate both them mfs! 🙁 welp no TV for me tonight.
"If you are too dangerous to fly, you are too dangerous to own a gun" -Clinton  YAS!  #debatenight
@ChelseaSense Maybe Trump can be saved if he meets a hooker with a heart of gold? #Debates2016 #DebateNight #PrettyWoman
"I love the African American community.  I started a club!" - Mr. Donald Trump.  #Debates2016
"She's been trying to take [ISIS] out for a long time" - Trump SINCE SHE WAS LITERALLY IN COLLEGE WE JUST FOUND OUT! IT IS AMAZING!#debates
.@HillaryClinton has been smiling a lot. But I'm thinking she's not really enjoying a lot of this. #DebateNight
#debatenight Why's Lester Holt asking about Obama birth certificate. He's carrying water for Dems. Issue started by Clinton &amp; ended by Trump
My goodness, it would be the greatest act of irresponsibility to elect this man the 45th POTUS. #DebateNight
Trump- John Bender  Clinton-Claire Standish just kiss and make up. #Debates2016
DJT goes straight to law &amp; order; that has been code for decades for GOP against POC. #Debates2016
Stop and frisk did not benefit New Yorkers! It benefitted the citizens that weren't minorities!! #FactCheck #debatenight  #IKnowThis
Trump says that he'll release his tax returns if Clinton releases her 30,000+ deleted e-mails!  #debate2016 #debatenight #SneakyFuckers
From now on, whenever someone disagrees with me, standard response will be to yel "THE RECORD SHOWS I'M RIGHT!" #debates #debatenight
Trump wants to talk about Hillary's bad political decisions buts never held an office. #mkay #debatenight
you have law and order Donald, and it's killing young innocent men in the streets #debatenight
"Yes when I was young I was sued for racial discrimination but it was okay BECAUSE EVERYONE WAS RACIST THEN" - Donald Trump rn #debatenight
Trump is allowed to ramble on but what is he saying? #debates
Did you notice how both candidates say "Nuclear" and not "Nucular". That's a breath of fresh air #debatenight
Hello Lester ... Get on to the crowd for clapping for Hillary.  #debatenight
#Trump is right by saying that #HillaryClinton will extend the mess created by Washington politicians &amp; obama administration. #debatenight
"My son, he's so good at computers it's unbelievable! He is the best at cybering! The BEST." #Debates
I can't even type a tweet fast enough to react to this rant. #debatenight
I'd sympathize more with the "police being outgunned" argument if those with AKs were shooting cops and not kids in schools #Debates2016
Let's look at Dem policies ,Chicago,Baltimore, Detroit, NY. How's that working Hillary? #neverhillary #debatenight
Using #Hillary's site to check facts is like using the TSA for airport security. #debatenight #debates #Debates2016
Clintons very boring. I need an unpredictable megalomaniac to entertain me for the next 4 years #debates #debatenight
THERE IT IS TRUMP FINALLY DID IT!! HE BROUGHT UP SUPER PREDATORS THE ABSOLUTE MAD MAN #debates
Trump is for Stop and Frisk   Think about this   It's 2016  This man wants to be our president   Think before voting please   #debatenight
Clinton had to sigh and catch her breath after listening to Trump, we all did, 😧😤 #Debates2016
"Oh I love that city, I have business there." Trump looks at cities as $$ instead of 👪. It's only loved if brings him profit. #Debates
What we really should be discussing is how the Warriors blew a 3-1 lead #DebateNight
Did I just feel a 1 second earthquake right in the middle of the debate? DIS TEW MUCH #debatenight
Ok so what does Trump think the word "temperament" actually means #debatenight
He reminds me of my kids when they get in trouble... They just spew nonsense..... #debatenight
This  #debates  is better the #LHHH and I love that show. This is Love And The President aka #Scandal
I didn't know Candy Crowley was going to moderate tonight's debate. #debatenight
drink every time you want to go hug lester and say "hey i'm sorry man" #debates
I meditate every day and I still can't focus on what Trump is saying for longer than 15 seconds. #debatenight
"Do you support the current policy?" @realDonaldTrump is really thinking "What is the current policy?" #debatenight #HillYes #ImWithHer
I don't think we should chastise people for taking advantage of tax loopholes. We should close the loopholes. #debatenight
Thank goodness for wine during these debates. I can't get through this any other way. #debatenight
#debatenight "your president " you mean " our president " @realDonaldTrump @HillaryClinton . Im going to miss you @BarackObama 😞
Yeah, Donald, your company is unbelievable, as in, I literally don't believe it's worth as much as you claim. #debatenight
"You know what Lester I'm losing right now so I agree. We should end this here and move on. Yeah....." @realDonaldTrump #debatenight
In case you're wondering, Trump also just received the endorsement of the 400 pound hacker sitting on his bed. #debatenight
Hillary should have interjected there with a taxes zinger when he said that NATO countries need to pay their fair share. #debatenight
"Trump didn't pay fed income tax." "That makes me smart."  😶 #Debates2016
Hillary wants free college for all. Free = paid for by the American taxpayer!  #debatenight
For the love of God someone please teach Donald how to properly snort coke! #snifflegate #debatenight
I love millennials. We all watch the debates but use snapchat filters to distract from the impending doom. #debates #imwithher
#Debates2016 shit look out Lester he's coming for you now! Ya think he's past his 2 minutes?!? Lester woke up for a minute.
Trump keeps saying he can name endless examples for various things, gives 0 such examples. Mod, say: “name three. Right now.” #debatenight
@realDonaldTrump makes shit up as he goes. Holy god this is embarrassing to watch #debatenight #ImWithHer
Braggadocios is my new favorite word. I was impressed when I googled it and found out it was a real word. #DebateNight #ICDebateWatch
In the criminal justice system, sexually based offenses are considered especially heinous. In New York City, the dedicated #debatenight
Michelle Obama is on tape calling Barack's birthplace Kenya. But the birther theory has no evidence. Sure. #DebateNight
@AnneWheaton nothing! Absolutely nothing. He utters a lot of words but says nothing #debatenight #Trump
Trump 'I have a much better temperment' audience laughs Best debate moment!!! #debatenight
Mr. Trump you keep going back to YOUR interest what about our countries interest?  #Debates
This is the best episode of Wild N' Out I've ever seen. #debatenight
Never miss a chance to plug your new hotel - Presidential Debate 101 #debatenight
Law &amp; Order. We need it in Charlotte &amp; we need it in our country. I stand with our police, NOT Hillary. #debatenight #debates
#debatenight  Not all gangs are illegal immigrants &amp; not all illegal immigrants are bad people. You also cant tell whos gonna shoot someone
"It's just one of those things" I'm sorry did he say racism is JUST ONE OF THOSE THINGS #Debates
@NooneOfan Trump says he's smarter than 99% of Americans who pay taxes because he's a billionaire who DOESN'T! #DEBATES2016
If it isn't currently a candidates time to speak, why isn't their mic just shut off? #debatenight
Scare tactics and bullying - and many people will buy into it #debatenight #jackass
OMFG - WHY NOT?? Ladies &amp; Gentlemen, there it was in the first 29 minutes: Slam &amp; Dunk @realDonaldTrump Get her,Tiger #FoxNews #debatenight
Trump states once again that he's under a "routine audit" and that he'll release them once he's finished. #debatenight
Hes nodding like he agrees with her. Even he knows what's right. Go Hillary! #debates
NYC is not better under the current mayor. It's worse. Live there @HillaryClinton #debatenight
Cue the Jenny Jones Door bell and let Hannity walk out!! #Debates2016 #PresidentialDebate
"Well I don't have a plan for that Lester, but let me address something else entirely"  #NeverTrump #debatenight
If she can't delete emails, he can't delete tweets.   #GOODNIGHT #Debates2016 #ImWithHer
The dogs and G out voted me... we are not watching the #Debates2016
I'm not watching the #debates  but the noxious fumes of its existence are still making me sick.
Donald bragging about himself and his company, justifying bankruptcy shows me he has no capacity for critique #debatenight
This is so entertaining. Those who had created drinking games were probably plastered in the first 15 minutes.#debates
It's going to be a long four years, ladies and gentlemen. #debatenight
Ugh. Both of these 'candidates' are awful. These simply CANNOT be the best America has to offer, right America?#WeCanDoBetter #Debates2016
#Trump "I've built an *unbelievable* company, it's unbelievable." He's right, I DON'T BELIEVE IT. #Debates2016 #Debates
The only thing I have nice to say about Donald Trump is his tie is very nice. It would look better on President Obama though. #Debates2016
God, just answer the question Trump, HOW are you gonna do it, don't just blabber? SHE answered it straight! #debatenight #ImWithHer
He was for the war in Iraq in 2002 on Howard Stern #debates
I'll vote for whoever promises to get the @Jaguars coach Gus Bradley fired and Blake Bortles traded.   #debatenight
Watched a bit of the debates... Disappointed with the state of our country haha
When Trump goes "excuse me" or "wait a minute" to Clinton I want to throw up #debates
"A man that can be provoked by a tweet should never have his hands near the nuclear codes" #debatenight
ISIS wouldn't have been formed if Iraq was interested in forming a functioning country to begin with. #Debates
Trump is relying on gimmicks,shouting &amp; flourishing of hands to get his points across..he's not answering the questions at all #debatenight
It's a bad sign that lawyers are telling you not to release them #DebateNight
#Debates2016 Trump buildings are in the cities. What has he done for us lately? #msnbc #Maddow
Trump refers to The Stern Show &amp; no one yelled out Bababooey or Hit'em With The Hein. That's the real elephant in the room. #debatenight
Waiting for the the New York Times to shut down Dump. #debatenight
Yes, investing in middle class is always the way to go. #debatenight
Trickle Down is what gave Bill the great economy he takes credit for in the 90's. #debatenight
Trump is beating the Clinton so much in this debate.. didn't expect this.. #DEBATENIGHT
he is proud that the nra endorses him.... how about the kkk? #Debates2016
Trump promised his tax returns and a $5 million check for Obama birth certificate, never happened #debatenight
He keeps referencing the black guy and the woman and saying "Vacuum." #debatenight
Trump is truly amazing, even managed to plug a new business by the Whitehouse #debatenight
At the break, someone needs to remind @HillaryClinton  to stay wonky. Don't get sucked into his pissing contest. #Debates2016
Shoot out! Riggs kills two! Oh no Riggs has a gun to his head! 😲 #debatenight
Riggs and Murtaugh meet!! He says "I'm too old for this shit!" Classic lineeeeeeeeeee #debatenight #LethalWeapon
"Maybe because you haven’t paid any federal income tax for a lot of years…” - @HillaryClinton #debatenight #Debates2016 #HillaryClinton
My man Lester is just too nice to tell them to stop talking #debates
Also, did I hear Trump brag about not paying federal taxes? Means he's smart? So taxes are for us little people? #Debates2016
Trump brought up Hillary calling black people super predators it's lit #Debates
Donald is an idiot. He is melting down! There is no way this idiot is Presidential... #debatenight
There's still two more of these after tonight, best trilogy ever #Debates2016
"The security of cyber is very very tough". He has no idea what he's talking about #debatenight
@realDonaldTrump on the defensive that should not have happened. She clearly is better at #debatenight
DONT TRY TO BE ON BERNIES SIDE HES TOO GOOD FOR U TRUMP #debatenight
How on earth will Trump's surrogates ever spin this? Someone buy them a drink. #debatenight
Trump is being so effin and Clinton is being so calm with everything! He's the only one raising his voice 😂 #debatenight
Trump needs to shut the fuck up and let the guy talk! #Republicans #Democrats #USA #UK  #debatenight  🇺🇸
"We're trying to talk about racial healing--" "Look" Trump didn't let Holt finish a single sentence. That's very telling #debates
I forgot that this was the reason I don't watch debates they both lie for 90 minutes nd they are just a joke 😑 #debatenight
I love hillarys face when trump starts talking about police shootings, like "oh boy, here we go" #debatenight
Hillary did her fucking research. This is like watching Gall vs CM Punk #debates
Cyber Security will be a toughie Hillary, eh? "Don't worry, the Russians did it" Ah feck off Hillary. #DebateNight
Again I say that not all Americans think like this wackadoodle  #Debates #DumpTrump
"see you in four years" - Donald trump if he wins #debatenight #debates
Why don't you let her finish before you interrupt her every word? #Debates2016
"You know what else I prepared for? I prepared to be President." -@HillaryClinton #debatenight #rekt
Hillary now trying to use the drug war's failure to her advantage. YOU HAVE BEEN FOR THE WAR ON DRUGS FOR FOREVER! #debatenight
You should only be allowed to moderate the debate if you have toddlers or tweens and can get them to not talk out of turn. #debates
I don't need to watch the debates.  I just follow @YourAnonNews for all my rage-inducing needs.  #Election2016
This election is like the Matrix, take the blue pill or red pill, difference is both induce hours of projectile vomiting #debatenight
Trump can not answer any question without placing blame on someone, he can't say how he plans to correct problems #Debates
I like how trump straight up lies and doesn't look to be at all remorseful #DebateNight
Stealing the resources of an occupied nation is a great way to keep insurgencies from developing. Natives love that shit. #debatenight
"@jabush: Hillary: that is just not accurate Donald: WHAT IF I YELL IT LOUDER #debatenight"
Yeah, yelling at Lester Holt is really going to get you there #debatenight
"My strongest asset is my temperament." Another lie from Donald.  LOL. #debatenight #ImWithHer
question is about tax returns and he's talking about trade deals.... where you at @LesterHoltNBC #debatenight
If debates are won or lost in the first 30 minutes, .@realDonaldTrump has choked bigly. Sad! #Debates2016
God clinton is feeding democrats shit, bias is very unreal now. Its more of profiling with how your dressed/speak #debatenight
Did... Did they just fucking agree on something? LET ME FALL THE FUCK OVER RIGHT NOW. #NoFlyNoBuy #debates
I have the endorsement of the NRA, which I'm very proud of. 'Nuff said. #debatenight
Yes I stayed home...I prepared for this debate and prepared to be President of the United States! @HillaryClinton #DebateNight @WIPPWeDecide
Would TRUMP hit the red button very lightly. A LIE IS A LIE! @vote @Women_Vote #Debates @WIPPWeDecide
I can't keep up - reminds me of the shell game - from taxes to airports where is the pea? #ConMan #debates
Thank You Secretary Clinton! Thank you for preparing for the most important Job in the U.S.  #debates
@stlcardscards so does your hobby involve self-immolation or are you just watching the debates instead of #Cards game
Oh boy. Obama ain't gonna be playing golf. Hil's gonna sit his ass on the Supreme Court next to his wife. #debatenight
"I love stop and frisk" "It was deemed unconstitutional." "No it wasn't." - THE MAYBE PRESIDENT, YOU GUYS. #debates
Bit rich from Trump to lecture Hillary on how to talk about people  #debatenight
I can't even sit down watching this debate! I am a nervous wreck watching LiVE TV 🙃 #debatenight #Debates2016 #PresidentialDebate
Trump is only a voice for his ignorant supporters who support his ignorant ideas not the entire country &amp; everyone in it. #debatenight
I would be richer than Donald Trump if I had a dollar for every time he said tremendous, jobs and things, durning this debate #debates
Nukes are the single worst problem..when America is the ONLY country that used Atomic BOMBS to slaughter hundreds of thousands #debatenight
"I will release my tax returns when she releases the emails." Sounds fair  #debatenight
Could be someone who weighed 400 pounds who hacked into it  #debatenight
#debatenight #Debates2016 I'm going to sip wine every time he saids, "AFRICIAN Americans"
"We need law and order...." the TV show.  I can't take this seriously.  #debatenight
Fact Chk: The negative things @realDonaldTrump said about @RickSantorum, whom he just hired, THIS election cycle. #hypocrisy #debatenight
That was a BIG SNIFF! Is he sick? We need health records!!! #debatenight
How can Hillary respond to that question? I have no clue what he's even said #debatenight
Let's all remember that one of the candidates should be in prison 😂 #DebateNight
If Trump paid no income tax, it was because the income tax code is a JOKE, not because he did anything "wrong" thats the point  #debatenight
Ask him where he thinks those black market weapons come from. #Debates
deport him and build a wall around the earth so that he can't come back #debates
One word you shouldn't say when you're a Presidential candidate..."Probably". Either you know the facts or you don't #Debates2016
They should be paying us?  The U.S. government is not the mafia! #debatenight
*Plan for tackling racism*  Clinton: My plan is to... Trump: We need law and order We need law and order We need law and order  #debatenight
Can somebody find out what Donald Trump considers "alot of money"? #debatenight
Trump's face right now... yep, newsflash — stop and frisk is unconstitutional #debatenight
Who gives a fuck about emails. Let us see your fucking returns. #debatenight
Trump: I am the best. I have no real plan or strategy, but I am the best. Believe me. #debatenight
"When they go low, we go high." Can't beat a beautiful @MichelleObama quote #Debates2016
C'mon small-town America, you know what it's like when you land on a flight from Dubai. Right? Who's with me? #debatenight
Of course @HillaryClinton playing the #RaceCard to get minority votes, she'll say anything to get elected! #Trump2016 #Debates
She knew he couldn't resist defending how rich he is   #debatenight
New conspiracy: Hillary is only 24, as she's been fighting ISIS her entire adult life. #debatenight
It feels like she is the president and he's the muppet in the balcony. #Debates2016 #mahnammanopp
Trump: "I've been all over the place" ya bud you still are #Debates
"Law and Order" Mr Trump please actually elaborate on what you mean by this #debatenight
#rhodengovecon #Debates2016  "It's all words. It's all soundbytes."  How can we trust him if he treats important matters as a joke?
Anyone who thinks @POTUS is going to golf for the rest of his life hasn't been paying attention to the progress we've made #debatenight
Trump: "would you like to hear?"  If we say 'No', would you listen...? #Debates2016 #debatenight
Trump needs his mini copy of the constitution again.  Needs to understand what Unconstitutional means. Hint: Can't do it #Debates2016
I wish Hillary would clean out my inbox too I hate going through and deleting stuff  #debatenight #Debates2016
Braggadocio type of rapping MC  "bragging and boasting" physicality, fighting ability financial wealth sexual prowess or coolness #debates
Trump is about to get ugly again. The race section is coming up. #debatenight
Trump: "I'm in audit, but as soon as it's done it'll be released." #Debates2016
Trump denies global warming as a threat to the world, favors nuclear war #debatenight
Second time Lester Holt fact checks Donald Trump, this time on support of Iraq war, and Trump calls debate moderator a liar. #debatenight
#debates2016 HilLIARy Clinton - yes Trump is Right it's a bunch of words &amp; sound bites - No substance Nothing to back up
Trump: "white folks get sued for not renting to blacks all the time...not a problem" #TrumpVsClinton #debatenight
"I have a much better temperament than she does." Wine spit across the room! #debatenight
I have NO problem with stop &amp; frisk. I don't care if it happens to me. It's worth it for safety.  #debates #debatenight #Debates2016
ISIS has been around for 50 years @realDonaldTrump ????? Whhhhaaatttt??? Lmfao #ToddlerTrump   #debatenight #debates
Hillary pulls out all these numbers and I would like to see the articles, who wrote them, and the legitimacy of these articles #debatenight
"Stop and frisk was ruled unconstitutional" "No you're wrong" Uh is he arguing with Lester now? #debatenight
Hillary dehydrated for the debate so she doesn't choke/cough. Notice she drinks no water! Keeps licking lips! #Sickhillary #Debates
Trump: I got ahead by skirting laws of this country &amp; not paying tax. I plan on changing laws so I can't continue to do that. #debatenight
Okay this is 100% not how audits and taxes work. Audits should make it easier to release your returns. #debatenight
Imagine the day that Muslims come up in a debate as human beings and not as your counter-terrorism tools. #debatenight
So Trump got support of 200 general and admirals.  Hmm currently about 886 in the US military.   Shy over 25% just sayin' #debatenight
trump and hillary are horrible and will do more damage than help in the U.S. to choose "between the 2 lesser evils" is bs #debatenight
Clinton's strategy of not interrupting Trump is working well: She looks calm, he drones on nonsensically #debatenight
Trump thinks that he can ignore that he can release his tax returns. Disingenuous. #debatenight #debates #Debates2016
Clinton being more aggressive as debate goes on. Trump flailing away #debatenight #debates #Debates2016
#debatenight"I think implicit bias exists in all of us, not just in the police." = honest
Trump sounds like the homeless guy in "A Clockwork Orange," "No law &amp; order no more!" #debatenight
She never said we no longer need police... just we need better trained officers #DebateNight
Remember kids: when someone calls you on your bullshit, keep interrupting by muttering, "Wrong!" #lifehacks #gotoyourroom #debatenight
My nose is huge. It's tremendous. My lies are absolutely tremendous. People are telling me how great they are. Really. #debatenight
Kk my grandma lives in Palm Beach and let me just tell you how NOT DIVERSE IT IS #Debates2016
#debatenight @realDonaldTrump is feeding his crowd and not hitting the middle that he needs. Where's your tax returns?
Wait..I'm taking advantage of the tax laws of this country..that would be proud not to pay taxes @realDonaldTrump #debatenight
Please stop saying African American, Mr. Trump. You make the phrase some like poison. #debatenight
Trump is irrational! He's lost it.  His facial expressions are so unprofessional. #Debates
Is Trump's mic lower just so we can watch him lean into it to correct Hillary? Thank you, Commission on Presidential Debates.
What about those emails?¿That wasn't a mistake and you take responsibility for your lies...#Debates
Donald trump says "The Fed is doing political things." The man can turn a phrase. Lol #debatenight
Oh shit Lester Holt is at this #debatenight He been there the whole time?
#DonaldTrump "I wish we were more like #communists, #monoarchys, #oligarchys, and #dictatorships so we can have better airports." #debates
"For nonviolence offense" sooo... are we going to claim the war on drugs a failure yet or what? #debatenight
This guy just said we are a third world country because our airports suck. How many times was this dude dropped? #debatenight #debates
Is true Hillary... to many people jump to conclusions about each other #Debates
#Debates2016 You started the Iran Deal which is another beauty ! 🇺🇸💯
Oh wow, Trump is right about the bubble and the fed. Who the hell is coaching him? #debatenight
Hillary wants to take out isis and destabilize Syria at the same time and she wants to talk about temperament? #debatenight
Trump - we need law and order. If we don't have it we're not going to have a country #debates
Both of them plugging their website is too much for me rn. #outofcontrol #debatenight
I wish @HillaryClinton and @realDonaldTrump need to let @LesterHoltNBC moderate I hate the "I need to respond" crap. #debatenight #debates
Trump is blowing this bad. He shouldn't be elected to high school student government. #debatenight #Debates2016 #ImWithHer
Every time Trump's asked about this tax returns a fire is stoked in my chest #crookbehaviour #Debates
"Maybe the DNC hacker was someone sitting on his bed who weighs 400 pounds" - #Cybertrump #debates
And how do we know they're bad people? Somehow I think I know the answer. #Debates2016 #debatenight
He keeps talking about himself. Not what he'll do for Americans. #debatenight
Did Trump just say he was smart for not paying Federal Income Tax on live Tv!?!? WOW #DebateNight #HillaryVsTrump
If Trump couldn't say "Unbelievably" or "a disaster", he'd be a mime. #debatenight
So trump cares about Chicago crime because he owns property there? OMG, someone bring him a giant hook! He needs boo'd off stage!! #debates
Our government is a corporation so no one has to be natural born American citizen to be a CEO!  #Debates
I'd really hate to be the IRS employee that has to audit Donald. He must be so stressed. #debatenight
Trump.... I have a headache. Can we attempt to use our inside voices?????????????? Lol.................. #debatenight
Did he mean temper not temperament? His English isn't great--he did say "bigly" earlier. #debatenight
#debatenight Trump: "I'm not a businessman, I'm a business, man. let me handle my business, damn."💽🔥🇺🇸🎩🎙@JayZClassicBars
"Or maybe something more than that." - Trump. How did this dude become a nominee again? #debates
Donald, we know you have property sir. We don’t have to be reminded. #debatenight
There are actually real human beings who have cast a vote for #DonaldTrump #debates2016 #debatenight
I agree! we need law and order... I miss that show #qudw #debatenight
@AandGShow that's how all these debates are...does it have any translation to being a good leader?
Hillary.... Crankin' up the smug right now, elitist liberal style.... Big time. #Debates2016
I'm with Gladwell on #HillarysEmails ... When Russians and Wikileaks hack gov't accounts, isn't it better to BYOD? #debatenight
A man who can be provoked by a tweet should not have his hands near a nuclear code- @HillaryClinton #Debates2016
Hillary, you talk about laws and how we should respect them when you don't. Hypocrisy much? #debatenight
I would never play poker with Hillary Clinton...Trump? Definitely not a "poker face". Anyone else hear that in song?#hive55 #debatenight
Entering the 4th quarter. But it's not Lakers vs. Celtics. It's the Philadelphia 76ers vs. Sacramento Kings. #debatenight
Sure, remind the audience to be quiet but not drumpf to wait his turn to speak #debatenight
"Donald we need you to actually step BACK from the mic, not lean into it, thanks." #Debates2016
There isnt enough liquor for this train wreck. Yes, you did a lot of interviews DT. Good for you. Ratings dont make you POTUS.#debatenight
.@realDonaldTrump says he watched @HillaryClinton's debates with @BarackObama to prepare for tonight, says she treated him shabbily then.
Clintons eye bulge when Trump said they have become good friends 😂#debatenight
Lester had to tell him to stop interrupting her. He's got zero class. #debates
Texting with a friend in the states while watching this. He's actually terrified. Told him, he should be // we all should be. #Debates2016
#debatenight is really making me question who I follow on twitter... and why I'm watching this debate at all.
Trump: I did not support the war in Iraq. That is mainstream media nonsense. Holt: Record shows otherwise. #debatenight
"You're allergic to nuts? But have you ever tried MY nuts?" - Trump #debatenight
Do not care for either candidate, but both have really done their homework. I've definitely seen faults on both sides. #debatenight
#DebateNight pls ask Mr. Trump, How would you find who are bad people with stop and frisk rule?? By color, race??
Was that statement "wrong" @realDonaldTrump ? We get it already. You're an idiot. #debatenight #PresidentialDebate
Committing a federal crime is more than a "mistake" Hillary. You are not above the law. #Hillaryforprison #Debates2016
Is he taking the guns from the white supremacists making up a large portion of his voters?! #Debates2016
#debatenight..the Wharton School of Business should have their accreditation revoked for letting him graduate!!!
#Debates2016 #ETdebate1 Clinton must be thinking: "I can't believe I'm tied with this guy!"
Hillary: "A man who can be provoked by a tweet shouldn't have his fingers near nuclear codes."   Real, AF. #DebateNight
I hope @realdonaldtrump spends the entire rest of the debate on how much he and Sean Hannity used to talk about the Iraq War. #debates
ah it took 30 minutes to bring the emails in - #Debates2016
What is happening? I don't think I can ever legitimately complain about Canadian federal politics again... #DebateNight #cdnpoli
Omg.  Someone call @seanhannity right now before he does something drastic! #Debates2016
Wow, I'm the only one that's not watching the presidential debates.
So we've discussed cyber security by not talking about cyber security and racial healing by Obama's birth certificate. K. #debatenight
It's unclear if Trump's bully posture is tactical or compulsive.   #debatenight #debates
Absolutely no reason Trump shouldn't release his tax returns. His excuse is bullshit. #debatenight
I'm down with (and for) mental health, in the most respectful of ways #Debates2016 #msnbc
Currently looking for apartments in Canada to move into if trump wins,  fav if you tryna be roomies! #Debates2016
Really? You are telling Lester Holt, the moderator, that he's wrong? Smh. #debatenight #Debates2016
he says he doesnt drag her but his slogan is crooked Hillary wtf #Debates
awww shit.. my Infosec grad school thesis ya’ll ‘Cyber is very tough to secure’ #debates
Trump's simplistic view of international relations always comes back to his advocacy of a slumlord-mobster protection racket. #debatenight
Uhm....you lecture #DonaldTrump about focusing on negative aspects of crime in communities but not the #msm #debatenight
#debatenight Does he know the meaning of the word temperament? I think someone needs to explain it to him.
His projects are under budget by the use of illegals and screwing over contractors. #Debates2016 #debatenight
And this is the moment Trump crumbles in front of America, North America and the world. #debatenight he lost the debate and feels it
#debates This is what you get when a sixth grader debates a seasoned neoliberal.
I pay taxes and am proud of it. A patriotic duty to contribute to the strength of the nation. #debatenight
Donald Trump will have this country at war with everybody once he wins office...#debatenight
Barack Obama is a bad president bc crime in Chicago is up. --DT Believe him, he has property there! #debatenight
Donald Trump the type of person to complain about saying thank you #debatenight
I wasn't sure I would be able to handle to watch this because I have a strong dislike for Trump, but this is entertaining. #debatenight
@realDonaldTrump goes from "thousands" of murders since January to "4,000 since Obama took over." Blink and you'll miss it. #debatenight
Johann Wolfgang von Goethe: “There is nothing more frightful than ignorance in action.” #debatenight
Trump is debating Hillary AND Lester Holt? God, does he have to go into Super Cena mode? #debatenight #Debates2016
You can release your taxes while you're under audit, Trump, you lying moron. #DebateNight
"I was the one who got him to produce the birth certificate. HA"  1. Untrue. 2. Who cares 3. Do you not understand race relations.  #debates
Hillary is like "someone give this babbling idiot another glass of water" 😩😩 #debates
So voting for a criminal or an idiot makes me "more American"? #debates
"I was asked on a major show,"  Trump was on Big Bang Theory. #debatenight
I thought he was going to day he was just endorsed by #isis #debatenight
So many innocent lives lost with gun violence and no one has taken out Trump yet. It's very sad. #debatenight
Dude about a step away from proclaiming he got "Tiger Blood." This can't be life, Lord! #debatenight
"That makes me smart" - @realDonaldTrump re: NOT PAYING FEDERAL TAXES. No, it makes you "crooked" (I think you know that term) #debatenight
I would love a fact check ticker scrolling across the screen. #Debates2016 #NYDebate #TheBirthofaNation
I love the faux outrage over the emails. What about that assault case? Your audits? Your charity as a slush fund? #debatenight
can't believe I've waited 19 years to end up having to vote for one of these candidates (never trump) #debates
Everyone but #USA: "My fav ep of RealWhiteHouses of America is on! $10 says Trump flips a table &amp; Hillary pulls his weave.” #debatenight
Even if I was an undecided voter.. I could never vote @realDonaldTrump .. He is  temperamental &amp; childish. #debatenight
#Debates Is Mr. Holt keeping time on Trump &amp; why is he letting Trump continue 2 interrupt Sec. Clinton? @LesterHoltNBC
We have heard almost a 100 times who endorsed you Donald Trump, let's face the real issues here #SoArrogant #debates
"fightin ISIS your entire adult life" he though was a line that was going to leave the park...it never touched the bat. #debates
@BuzzFeed has a video of a puppy getting a massage and tbh that's way more important rn #debatenight
Hillary is implying Trump is racist, to his face, on national television. Very important #debates
We can see what Trump has built. What has Hillary built? #debatenight
Y'all remember Hilary called RIOTERS "Super Predators" not specifically black people. #debatenight
I'm sorry, but I don't think Hillary has met carpet installers. I don't think Trump has either. #debatenight
I like how @realDonaldTrump's approach to #debatenight is to respond to everything @HillaryClinton says like a hype man in a 90s rap song.
omg I'm so afraid of trump i can't handle this fjsjskdkd #Debates
@HillaryClinton writing down her roasts while Trump talks, instead of blurting them out during his turn, like trump does to her#debatenight
Can we make this debate into a drinking game?? Every time trump interrupts Hilary or Lester take a shot!!  #Debates
"650mil isn't a lot of $..."-- I know some folks who could do a load of good if he doesn't need it. #debatenight
can we get @GovGaryJohnson and @DrJillStein on the next debate to hear other opinions besides the big 2? #debates
Trump: "I have better than judgement than her, I mean look at that red pant suit!"  #PickYourPoison2k16 #Debates
so gangs and immigrants have NOTHING to do with police brutality #Debates2016 #HUDEBATEWATCHPARTY
all illegal immigrants are gangs roaming in the streets with guns #FACT #debates
New topic! Who will come out on top in this segment? Audience quiet again. #debatenight
Hillary doesn't even have to talk, Donald's got the shovel and he's digging #debatenight
Thank you twitter timeline for being a wonderful retweet fest! Everyone I follow is killing it tonight! #debatenight #funnyashell
#debatenight @MaddowBlog The record shows &amp; shows &amp; shows #Trump is lying about many things including his support 4 war n IRAQ
I shoulda said by thier own sniffs . ......SNIFF . . hahahahahahah ...obi  #debatenight #Wildwan #funk #Sniff #Trump does #yodatrump do = )
Did Trump just say that gangs are made up mostly of illegal immigrants...im shocked man #debatenight
Debate jujitsu on Cyber security by Trump: 'Could've been anyone (who hacked DNC), but we learned about attacks on Sanders. #debatenight
Like 10,000 US troops or something like that and if the US had taken ‘the oil’ ISIS wouldn’t have been formed, Trump says. #debates
Stop trying to make "Stop and Frisk" happen. It's not going to happen. #debatenight
Trump is always going off on tangents mid-sentence. Nobody calls Sean Hannity? What the hell? #debatenight
The Republican nominee for president said he is "smarter" 4 not paying federal taxes. What the hell kind of reality are we in? #debatenight
How would you take the oil??? Seriously no one is going to call him on this shit? #debatenight
Irony: Trump talking about the treatment of Black communities and settling out of court for refusing to rent to black people. #debatenight
Sitting at the airport, watching #Debates2016 #cap16twitterati friends, I'll see you in San Antonio for #USCAP17!!
Well #LesterHolt if "we're discussing race relations" then why did you ask a "birther question?" #debatenight
You got him to give it? Who? Bama? Tia chu la Trump! #Debates2016
I really want to see @HillaryClinton  turn to @realDonaldTrump and say "Donald, you are so full of shit."  #debatenight
He has no stance on cyberattacks, he's just repeating what Hillary said. #debatenight #Debates2016
HOW CAN YOU DENY STOP AND FRISK WAS DEEMED UNCONSTITUTIONAL THAT'S *LITERALLY* A FACT #debatenight
What if frat boys said, "Let me see dem taxes" instead of "Let me see dem tiddies"? #Debates2016
Im feeling like #trump has paid for all these damn endorsements... like really dude. #debatenight
Pa Ave DC hotel thing - did he just admit he's going to lose? #debatenight #Debates2016
Maybe Donald Trump should of spent that small loan of a million dollars on English lessons! #debatenight
We need to go after bag-daddy??? Did I hear things wrong? #HillaryClinton #debates
WTF is he saying? Why did his ten year old son appear in that sentence? 😮 #debatenight #fb
They're both old rich white liberals that cheated and stepped on many to gain power #debatenight #goodjobAmerica
Who cares about tax returns. We want to know what in those damn emails! #Debates2016
Can we get back to discussing, oh I dunno, running the country? #pettynonsense #debatenight
"Too many of us jump to conclusions about each other." @HillaryClinton #debatenight Made us think of #RBCstep5 'We are open' #RBCpositics
Uh, I think you mean "A city that I love because I have investments." #debatenight
Are you congratulating yourself for proving an American is an American? #debatenight @realDonaldTrump
You get audited a lot, huh, Trump? Maybe you strategically filing for bankruptcy 4 times is why the IRS watches you like a hawk. #debates
The wealthy are going to create many jobs? 🤔 wait...let me think that over lol #debatenight
Oh we're moving to race? This should be good. RIP my TV #debatenight
I AM TRANSPARENT!! #DEBATES !! LESTERHOLT SAVE ME!! DO A #CANDYCROWLEY!! WAVE THOSE PAPERS LIKE A LITTLE SCHOOL GIRL! #BOO #TRUMP
His answer is unacceptable... throwing blame on Clinton for his birther actions.  #Debates
If I had a dollar for every time Trump avoided the question I'd be as rich as him  #Debatenight
Honestly, how is her head not tilting side to side like a dog? #Debates2016
Not unconstitutional just a against police judge, like an against Trump University judge #debates
This man literally cannot answer a question to save his life!! #debatenight
Lester: Can we just move on? Trump: but I need to talk about myself more #debatenight
#debatenight That's like taking dinner from a restaurant, eating it and then saying that it wasn't good.
@HillaryClinton How can Trump keep our country safe, when he can't even keep a wife. #divorce  #debate #debatenight
Trump masks his lack of actual content by just yelling at Hillary #debatenight
Nation needs to restore trust b/t communities &amp; police and ensure police are using best training/techniques -@HillaryClinton #debatenight
Hey Hillary, what should happen to politicians who were running guns in Libya? #Debates2016
So, is this a circus, or a political debate? Because all i see are two clowns making hilarious jokes. #DebateNight
Any1 who fails 2 answer their phone &amp; respond when American servicepeople r being shot @ by terrorists should not be President #debatenight
This bit with Trump trying to defend himself over his position on Iraq literally makes him sound unhinged! #DebateNight #BBCNews
Robot still throwing punches. So good so far. Says orangutan doesn't pay taxes or employees. #debatenight #orangutanvsrobot
10 minutes and I still don't know what Sean Hannity said to Trump! #debates
"I have a much better temperament than Secretary Clinton. WAIT WAIT WAIT LET ME FINISH!!!" #debatenight
Can't ban people on terrorist watch list from owning guns without also fixing the mess that is the terrorist watch list. #debatenight
Clinton: Trump criticizes her for staying home to prepare for this debate. Said she's also preparing to become president. #debatenight
Why keep talking about the birth certificate after produced??'Cause he got him to produce. Huh?? glad Hillary called him on it. #debatenight
Trump says he figured Lester Holt would ask him about his birtherism, and yet this is STILL the best explanation he has. #Debates
THIS DEBATE IS SO MATURE AND ADULT *slams head into wall* #debatenight
"I settled that lawsuit with no admission of guilt" - that doesn't mean you're actually not guilty #debatenight
"We came up with the Internet" - Trump channeling Al Gore #debatenight
Can we get a meme of Sean Hannity sitting lonely by the phone? #debatenight
See, they need to cut the mic when this type shit happens. #Debates2016   #diarrheaofthemouth
Money in the budget for implicit bias re-training??? MENTAL HEALTH TRAINING?? HELL YES #imwithher #debatenight

Oh my god. Sanctions don't hurt dictators they only hurt the common people! #Debates2016
#debatenight That's called trickle down economics, Donald. We already tried that... Show us your taxes!
@debates @CNN Hearing Donald Trump is like listening to cats scratch on a chalkboard...it's painful to hear and watch #Debates2016 #debates
Is the #IRS watching this? He's admitting to not paying taxes. What the fuck. #debatenight #Debates2016
How is she going to speak on cyber security? She didn't know you can't send classified email on a public server...pretty basic #debatenight
For shits sake can someone give Lester a glass of water #DryMouth #debatenight
#LESTER where ARE you?!  #debates This is not how a debate is conducted.
#debatenight,,, Donnie STILL has not given one solution to how he will bring back jobs !
If Donald is unsure about the stats, how can I trust that his policies will reflect the needs of everyday citizens? #Debates
The most important part of the debate. My bowl of ice cream was just handed to me. #debatenight @realDonaldTrump @HillaryClinton
Trump on the defensive responding to Clinton. She's calling the shots. #Debates2016 #debatenight
Yes! My favorite part of the debates. Who we're gonna bomb next. #debatenight
You have to be idiotic to say you disagree with facts? That is not how this works. This is why bigots love Trump. #debatenight
American voters are like teenagers, the more you tell them not to do something, the more they want to vote for #Trump! Lol #debatenight
@caulkthewagon @JonathanCohn I'm not watching, but is it worse than she was during the democratic debates?
Every time @realDonaldTrump says he agrees with @HillaryClinton she looks about to plotz. #debatenight #debates
#debatenight holy crap this "too dangerous to fly you're too dangerous to buy" is bullshit! It's called DUE PROCESS!
@realDonaldTrump America isn't great because of it's prosperity but because of it's integrity #NATO #ImWithHer #NeverTrump #p2  #debatenight
So we're all only watching #debatenight in hopes of some kind of epic meltdown, right? I mean, this charade isn't changing any minds, is it?
Hillary makes me sick ! can't look at that ugly mug for a long period of time !!!! #Debates
In @LesterHoltNBC defense, these are 2 head strong people fighting to be the leader of the free world. That's a tough job! #debatenight
#debatenight was Barack Obama the president of the US or the mayor of Chicago?
#debatenight "My *sniff* tax cut is the biggest *sniff* since Ronald *sniff* Reagan..."
Trump just referred to Clinton's ads about him as "nasty." They are literally just clips of things he's said. #debatenight
@realDonaldTrump wait your turn. Your artificial hair isn't falling out just yet #debatenight
Donald only cares about places where he has property...Can someone get him a monocle? He's playing monopoly. #Debates2016 #CBSNreax
YES! This man is an out and out racist, glad to see her call it out straight. #debatenight
Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama created ISIS!!!! Confirmed by Donald Trump! #Debates2016
I want to go to bed but this is train wreck TV #TrumpVsClinton #debatenight
The "politicians" that have made our country "horrible" are the same that allowed Trump to grow from $14 million to billions. #debatenight
Clinton not only appears to be winning on policy but is surprisingly also winning in audience laughs #debates #Debates2016
Donald Trump talks like he got all of his information from a friend who once read a Wikipedia article. #debatenight #debates
It's a slaughter Trump sounds sane She can't keep up with his attacks #debatenight
Hillary: I won't change anything b/c My for profit prisons need full beds to make $$$ #debatenight
Must be time for a break @HillaryClinton has lost her place in the script 3 times #debatenight
I mean Trump is not wrong about African American communities being screwed by politicians #debatenight
This guest list proxy war: Any media outlet do a 360-degree shot of the audience with all the guests labeled? #debatenight
Donald Trump answers questions like that kid in class who didn't do his homework yet tries to answer every question. #debatenight
'No admission of guilt'  doesn't actually mean that you aren't guilty of something #debatenight
Hillary attacking Trump for building "on the backs of little guys" is the definition of Irony #debatenight #debates #Debates2016
What Obama got to do with the killings?..yes n deed..he full of it  #Debates
"Bureaucratic red tape." Let's add that to the binders full of women &amp; put it in a lock box. #Debates2016
"The security aspect of cyber is very very tough."   #AlmostAFullSentence #debatenight
Trump talks fast so not here something stupid.But he interrupts so we can here the dumbest things.#debatenight oh I want to hear this
A lid has not been placed on Iran's nuclear capability. The #IranDeal has only delayed it &amp; Iran is not playing by the rules. #debatenight
Financial disclosure so that Mexico can pay for the wall lmao  #Debates
"Everyone should be respected by the law"...but what happens when the law itself is inherently anti-blackness?  #Debates2016
#debate #debate2016 #debatenight Americans care about jobs, borders, health. @HillaryClinton stuck on race and birther issue..
The greatest trick the devil ever played, was getting us all to waste the past 1.5 hours on #debatenight
Trump: "I have a presidential temperment"  Entire crowd: "lmao"  #debatenight #cbsnreax
The main thing we want to know is what are you going to do?? Do you care about everyone's well being? #debatenight
"ITS A MESS" no its a complex situation w real people struggling w problems stemming from imperialism and historic conflict #debatenight
Trump says if he doesn't get to Pennsylvania Ave by winning he will get there one way or another. LHM! #debatenight  #DebateShenanigans
I'd rather watch the Saints lose than watch all of America lose #DebateNight
"You apologized for this but I'm gonna bring it up anyway because people didn't like it and I want to remind them of that" #debatenight
#debatenight @andysignore Remember on Movie Fights when everyone lets each other talk and doesn't take things too seriously....
Hillary also once uttered the words, “All Lives Matter,” during a speech. Oops. I didn’t forget. #DebateNight
That was as sanitized an answer on race-turned-gun discussion I’ve heard this year. Missed the mark on that one, Secretary. #DebateNight
I really want someone to ask Hillary in the post-debate what it's like to debate a Disney villain #debatenight
By the way do they remember the question was about race not guns? #debatenight
Anyone wanna bet #DonaldTrump is going to say this #debatenight was rigged by the end of this?!?? He's going to be pissed
Trump: We have no money to rebuild roads. Clinton: Maybe that's cause you haven't paid your taxes. #Debates
Trump, trade deficits have nothing to do with your taxes  #debatenight #Debates2016
Trump starts blaming Clinton for birther again! OMG! I can't!  #debatenight #Debates2016
Is Trump's temperament better because he's a man or because he's Trump? #debatenight
There is no hope for our country, but it sure is entertaining watching the ship sink. #debatenight
"I said alksdjf;laskjboaijklasdf;lkerj;lkadnflkasndfasd, how can I be more clear?" - Transcript of Trump at tonight's debate. #debates2016
Famous lover of lies @piersmorgan is lecturing Hillary on being smug. The irony is just too much #debatenight
I want a stream of Hillary's facial expression to play out of a projector in my head every time someone spouts bullshit at me. #debates
@VaultOfDaedalus i have no idea what gpinf on bc i am not watching  the #debatenight but doing homework 😑
Trump is actually a good politician, he answers the question he wants not the one that is asked #debatenight
#debatenight I think Donald just accused me of preparing for tonight- yes I did and I prepared to be the next President of the USA. Go Hilar
Trump gets laughs from the audience after he says his temperament is his biggest asset #debatenight
Dear god, he just can't answer the question he was asked. #debates
My cat almost just donated $200 to Hillary Clinton by standing on my phone. #debates #debatenight #ImWithHer #MyCatIsWithHer
I am so incredibly frustrated by the amount of interruptions in this #debates LET EACH OTHER SPEAK. DO YOU NOT UNDERSTAND WHAT A DEBATE IS?!
.@realDonaldTrump would run this country with the tact of a 3rd world strongman... #debatenight
FACT CHECK: There is at least one gang in the United States that is not 100% composed of illegal immigrants, LIAR #debatenight
Lmao Trump's business is literally taking money from people and then losing it, businessman my ass #debatenight
"Very lightly" supportive of war. Gotcha. That should settle it then. #debatenight #whatisgoingon
“Hey South Korea, this is great country, it would be a same if anyone nuked it.” - Trump mob boss president #debatenight
I can't handle 2 more debates. 2 MORE DEBATES OF THIS!!!
@realdonaldtrump What about Central Park Five????? Yes, she said "super predator" but you sentenced innocent boys to die. #Debates
"I have a winning temperament" he says yelling, sniffling, and interrupting #debatenight
Wow!  Trump is now ragging on fat people!  He's not exactly a skinny Minnie himself!  Just another example of his prejudice #DebateNight
Trumps answers sound like the homework you hand in that you did in the beginning of class #DebateNight
First candidate to forgive my student loans gets my vote and an edible arrangement #Debates2016
Most people do not listen with the intent to understand; they listen with the intent to reply. #USPresidentialDebate #debates #DebateNight
@cultofdusty Even the most ignorant racist in America knows that just because someone is black dont mean they are from Africa #debatenight
Trump didn't even know the cities in which the shootings happened 😩 #Debates2016
Yo seriously what does Obama have to do with it?  #debatenight
Hillary has something to say about the birther thing. I'm excited. #debatenight
According to Trump, saying something to someone once means they agree with him. #Debatenight
Trump is confirmed dumb. I think we need his IQ test result. I am no longer interested in his tax. I want his IQ test. #debates #Debates2016
"Barrack this, Barrack that, ive done this I've done that" is all I'm hearing trump WHAT WILL YOU DO NOW!!! #debatenight
So now he's bragging about putting jobs outside of the US? Make up your mind @realDonaldTrump #Debates2016
Trump will go against the wishes of his lawyer and release his tax returns when Hillary releases her 33,000 deleted emails #Debates2016
God bless the next 4 years! Both candidates are weak!  #debatenight
#debatenight #debates I feel like Trump's campaign manager gave him good points, but his inability to shut up screwed up his argument(s).
#debatenight When I discuss politics Im very fair If I'm gonna talk smack about Donald Duck Ill do the same for HilLIARy Clinton #TheDebate
Things Trump brag about Not paying workers Not paying taxes Hoping for housing crisis #debatenight
When Trump didn't mentioned Hillary's emails during a talk on Cyber Security you know he lost #debates
It's not an argument. Stop and frisk is CONSTITUTIONALLY racist. No argument. It is law. #debatenight
5 mins into the debate and I've already cringed too many times to count #help #whyisthisreal #DebateNight
And by "law and order" he means a real life version of the Annual Purge 😳 "Get yourself a bunker ASAP"!!! #debates #DebateNight
Impressive how much @realDonaldTrump is prepared &amp; has examples to talk about all his points! Hillary, not so much! #Debates2016 #TrumpTrain
I love the way he drops in 'I have property there' whenever an American city is mentioned.  Why is that relevant? #debatenight
"I take advantage of the laws of the nation because I run a company,"- @realDonaldTrump #debatenight
"If you're too dangerous to fly, you're too dangerous to buy a gun,"- @HillaryClinton on people on the terror watch list #debatenight
Donald Trump is winning this debate against Crooked Hillary. Yes or No?. #debatenight
"Taking the fifth so that they're not prosecuted" "IT'S OUR SECOND AMENDMENT RIGHT TO HAVE OUR KILLY TOYS!!!!1!!" #debatenight Look @ urself
Ohhhhh girl Lester brought up #birtherism this just got real as shit #ImWithHer #debatenight #debates #Debates2016
At least Trump skipped the foundation today, he looks less orange. #debatenight
@larrywilmore Hey man don't take the bed comment personally!! HAHAH Just kidding. #debatenight
What do you think about oral sex betwen president and a secretary?  #debatenight Brígido @realDonaldTrump
Being under constant state of audit is not a bragging point??? #debates
Trump: "Look: it's all words. It's all sound bites." *proceeds with sound bites about own company* #debates #debatenight
A coked-up psychopath. That's what Trump is. Been watching him closely tonight. Definitely. #debatenight
Seems like Lester directs all the subject questions straight to the Hildabeast #debatenight
"I'm going to get to Pennsylvania Avenue" if now this way, another @realDonaldTrump #debatenight
"If we don't have Law &amp; Order, then we don't get SVU. If we don't get SVU, then what the hell am I supposed to watch, Lester?" #debatenight
I have noticed how Donald acts like a 12 year old going through puberty.  #Debates
Trump your temperament is worse than a sticky four-year-old w Cheetos residue on his face throwing a temper tantrum in walmart #debatenight
"I believe in community policing" YES HRC YES FINALLY SOME SENSE #debatenight
I'm in favor of shock collars for when a candidate speaks out of turn. #debatenight
In honor of the presidential debates, going with a past character for my profile pic - Presidential Candidate Smith Johnson #actorslife
Trumperament. I've got the best temperament in the history of temperaments.  #debates2016
A man who can be provoked by a tweet should not have his hands anywhere near the nuclear codes. #DebateNight
Trump's only hope right now is to remind America that the Golden State Warriors blew a 3-1 #debatenight
Taxes and unpaid invoices for once as a freelancer I can understand this nonsense #debatenight
I'm still trying to find this alternate negaverse hellscape version of America that Donald keeps referencing. #debatenight
Why is Trump so quiet right now? Race comes up and now you're silent lol no interruptions?? Lol #debatenight
So many WTF thoughts with almost everything that comes out of Trump's mouth. Just wow. #debatenight
On the edge of my seat waiting for trumps answer on race lol #debatenight
RT gov: Since #debates start, share of Twitter conversation around the two candidates on stage: 60% - realDonaldTrump 40% - HillaryClinton
Trump keeps sniffling. I don't think he's fit to be our president. 😄😄😂😉 #debatenight #PresidentialDebate #
I'm sorry but does anyone really want to pay taxes, Hillary? #Debates2016
Even Trumpians must be feeling massively embarrassed right about now.  #debatenight
'I took advantage of the laws of the nation.' @realDonaldTrump is blatant about stuff others would be embarrassed about. #debatenight
Howard Stern was just seriously mentioned in a presidential debate. If that's not a sign that we're in bizzaro world... #debatenight
Note: Mere pronouns are needed tonight and everyone knows exactly which candidate we're talking about. #debatenight #ImWithHer
"Donald invited Putin to hack into our systems." Oh, she went there. #Debates2016
The best thing that's going to come out of this election is the memes #debatenight
can we trebuchet both candidates into the sun and get people who aren't real life supervillains to debate instead? #debatenight
can make all the gun laws you want but the gangs and criminals will still get them just like drugs so up to police to get them #Debates2016
@realDonaldTrump is smart, pays 0 to IRS. I am dumb for paying as do my friends and family. #Debates2016
I don't understand why answers to the question on race are all about terror watch lists, stop and frisk, and gun control #debatenight
No, race does not determine where people live.   #debatenight  #Debates2016  #debates
"I found one friend to lie for me, but no one calls him!!!" #DebateNight
No one has really actually defended or asserted their position on anything and on top of it they sound like children. #debatenight
The birth certificate was produced in 2011, Trump kept questioning Obama's legitimacy for yrs afterward #debatenight
I'm sorry but all I focused on was that it sounded like Clinton mentioned Bag-daddy #Debates2016
#debatenight like birth certificate deal? He's so full of it. Go Hillary.
Well, good for Trump for calling out DWS and that Sanders was taken advantage of. #debatenight #Debates2016 #DebateWithFFL #debates
how do you tell that they're bad? check marks on the chalkboard? #debatenight
Temperament gets a laugh from the crowd as he shows his temperament problem #debatenight
Who comes up with the numbers in Trump's speech? Does he just make them up on the spot? #Debates2016 #debatenight
No coughs from Clinton, but Trump is sniffing like he snorted most of Bolivia. #Debates2016 #USPresidentialDebate
@HillaryClinton has been preparing for years to be president. @realDonaldTrump woke up one day and thought it might be fun. #debatenight
I wonder how many people hillary paid to laugh and cheer on her Q. #DebateNight #Thirdparty
He's right that her Libya policy is a disaster.  She's right that he supported the Iraq invasion &amp; a Libya intervention.  #debatenight
So now it's Obama AND Clinton who created ISIS, who's next?  #debates #Debates2016
#Debates2016 If we're honest, we know damn well Donald ain't go release no tax returns.
Omg LESTER do not let Trump talk over you like that!!! WTF!! 😡😡  #Debates2016
"We need to move on" - best thing Lester has said all night.   #debates2016
It's #debatenight!!!  Most people are watching the pres candidates debate......  I'm just over here debating if I should drop out or not 🤔
Oh my gosh trump shut your Oompa Loompa mouth and let her talk.  #Debates
lol. it is like a debate by one.  one person discuss policy.  the other is clueless.  #Debates2016
Ironically @realDonaldTrump is using same opportunity to nail @HillaryClinton eg. #superPredator as talking point #Debates2016
I hate to bring race into it but Whoever prepared @HillaryClinton should have been black. There. Is. No. Fire. In this woman #Debates2016
If I were Lester Holt,I'd be ducking under my desk to reapply my deodorant right about now. #debates *lawandorder *stopandfrisk *wrongLester
.@realDonaldTrump has been sniffling throughout the debate. Is he on coke? I demand that we give him a urine test on stage now. #debates
Can we deny that Apple &amp;others wont bring their money back home because of taxes? Our tax code is a problem #debatenight #taxes #debatenight
Maybe the reason Donald Trump gets audited every year is because he uses his Foundation to illegally pay off bribes and debts. #debates
There are trump supporters watching the debate in the same room as my I'm already mad #debatenight
Does this thing not have commercials? I need to make myself another drink #debatenight
The #debates are showcasing economic totalitarianism vs social totalitarianism. Ill choose #freedom shoulda #LetGaryDebate @GovGaryJohnson
Everyday people go to the circus and laugh at the clown. But he always leaves with a bag of money! #DebateNight
.@realDonaldTrump goes after @HillaryClinton on emails. "I'll release my tax returns when she releases 33K emails."  #debatenight
Hilary is informed. Whether you like it or not, she's the most qualified candidate #debatenight
Does no admission of guilt= not guilty? I'm not too familiar with our justice system #debatenight
Trump and Clinton both advocating using a secret watchlist to regulate guns now #restorethefourth #debatenight
Donald Trump: the presidential candidate who runs on having given no thought to NATO. #debatenight
"You're totally out of control!" he shrieked, hair askew, nose dripping, face red with rage. #debatenight
HRC: “Just listen to what you heard.” She should have walked off the stage after that. #debate #debatenight
... did he just say not paying taxes makes you smart? #debatenight
CORPS DO NOT MAKE JOBS WITH TAX CUTS. THEY HOARDE IT. That's what they've been doing for 50 years. #Debates2016
Reaching for votes...Small wars derived from one large civil war...First step: Quality education, support teachers #debatenight
Hillary is comfortable now that she knows which Trump came to the podium. The gloves are coming off. #debatenight Going high.
Trumpis playing on the naiveity of American public. Her private emails w daughter are private! #debates2016
Next debate needs to feature a mic that drops into the floor after 2 minutes &amp; rises briefly for rebuttals. #Debates2016 #
He said we need Law &amp; Order.. umm I think Dick Wolfe has that handled with SVU &amp; criminal intent  #Debates2016
don't ever use @BernieSanders to defend your racist, xenophobic, idiotic agenda, @realDonaldTrump . #debates
Every single topic that is brought up, Donald blames Hilary. Wow. I'm amazed. #DebateNight
Hillary won the first hour. I hope Donald's heart holds out another 20 minutes. He looks like he's had 2 strokes. #debatenight
Wow, that was such a weak comeback from Hillary.   She was sick in bed; "preparing to be president" my ass #debates
"Implicit bias is a problem for everyone, not just the police" #debatenight
Under the 400 pounds argument, half of America could have hacked the US #Debates
I wish she would say "I prefer people who have not been bankrupt"  #Debates
I am literally dead. I don't like either candidate but this is just beautiful. #debatenight
Trump is the disgrace America deserves. This is truly beautiful. I'm so proud. Country and jobs. Law and order. #debatenight
So his defense for being called a racist liar is: "well, you were mean to him, too!" Whiny, racist, childish, ass face #Debates2016
Trump just admits he hasn't paid taxes, claims "it makes me smart" #debates #debatenight
People in the inner-cities are being shot by cops and bad guys.  #Debates
American politics &amp; society has been debased by the candidacy of Donald Trump. His election would be a disaster. #debatenight
Would like it if Trump actually answered the questions so I could at least judge him fairly #debatenight
And onto nukes anf how Trump doesnt understand MAD and non proliferation. Just run the daisy ad #debatenight
That's not fair, Hillary! Trump has been preparing his whole life to make up all these facts tonight! #debates #debatenight #Debates2016
"The worst revival of the economy since the Great Depression" - @realDonaldTrump 🤔 #debatenight
Trump sighing like a child when Hillary says he speaks bad about black and Hispanic communities makes me F U C K I N G insane #debatenight
I'd love this orange idiot to come speak with my 88 yr old Puerto Rican grandma about this community he knows NOTHING about #debatenight
All the more reason why you're the worst possible candidate to lead this country, you bleached grapefruit. #debatenight
'that's what I do' sniff #payforyourcurtains ...opening a post office on Pennsylvania Avenue.... #PAYFORYOURCURTAINS #Debates2016
'We have to address the systemic racism in our criminal justice system' says Clinton #Debates2016
The NORTH ATLANTIC Treaty Organization going into the Middle East?  Really? #debatenight

"The African-American community has been let down by our politicians," @realDonaldTrump says. #DebateNight
Trump: "I have a much better temperament than she does. YES I DO AND IF YOU DON'T SHUT UP I'LL CUT YOU." #debatenight
I think it's 1 - 1. Who will win the final hour? #Debates2016
#debates Uhm. We're the major partner in NATO because we demanded base access / our own bases in NATO countries. STAY BUSINESS, MAN.
This is an absolute shit show. You all should be ashamed for allowing these people to come this close to the Oval Office.  #debatenight
Sniff. Again with the sniff. Trump will blame his sad performance on the sniffles. #Debates2016
Noine noine noine noine noine! Woah woah woah stop the clock. #debatenight #debate @HowardStern @sternshow
Trump is too friendly with Russia, I believe they were behind the DNC hack #debatenight
Gun epidemic? "That's the issue amongst black American death.. " Really Hillary? That's the main issue? #debatenight
"...bad people who shouldn't have guns..." but Trump.. Racial profiling by police? Police brutality? #debatenight
Donald Trump says Blacks and Latinos are living in hell. Hey y'all. I'm Latina. I'm doing very well. #Debates2016 #debatenight #YaBasta
Uh...Trump may not understand the history of stop &amp; frisk  #debatenight
@JenHatmaker the @Saints are losing, @netflix is booming, &amp; cell phone batteries are dropping #debatenight
Major breach of decorum as the audience applauds Trump's call for Clinton to release her "30k emails." #Debates
Donald started his career by "hating on us Muslims". Yes that's right. #debatenight
Seems like Donald Trump only cares about his properties. Hey hes gotta fix Chicago cause, u kno, he has investments there! #debatenight
He plays by the rules they set up. Government officials get wealthy from us. Income tax is illegal.  #Debates
Donald Trump hates politicians because they don't do enough. He's a pundit. He has no sense of government's limitations. #debatenight
Oooh, are we making Clinton won't say law and order the new Obama won't say radical Islam. Kill me now. #debatenight
I actually can't tell which one of them I hate more. And considering Clinton's history, that's truly impressive. #debatenight
Clinton calls on stage to end use of private prisons at the state level #DebateNight
Donald Trump (To Lester Holt): "When are you going to ask about my hands?" #DebateNight
Is anyone playing a drinking game taking a shot for every time Trump says "beautiful"? Oh jk you're already drunk by now. #Debates2016
This conversation has gone nowhere for the last 10 minutes.  Is Lester awake?? #debatenight #Debates2016
Trump uses for evidence of his purported resistance to Iraq War a PRIVATE conversation with Sean Hannity! #Debates2016
Trump says blacks are living in hell but is concerned about the super predator comment. #Debates2016
Trump discriminates so often that he wants credit when he doesn't. #Debates2016
I just stumped my toe and spilled my drink. Thanks Hillary! #TrumpLogic   #debatenight
Trump adlibs going to sink his campaign, he won't win additional voters this way... #debatenight
"Isis is beating us using the Internet" -trump what about KONY2012 doe?!? #DebateNight
I will release my tax returns, against my lawyer's suggestions, when she releases her 33,000 emails that were deleted #debatenight
Did he just mock 400 pound computer hackers? Well there goes the @reddit vote. #Debates2016
.@rhysiedarby  The best way to kill off Isis would be to make them listen to this debate - they'd lose the will to live.  #Debates2016
Is that Trumps's 4th or 5th condition about releasing his tax forms? EVERY other presidential runner has released theirs, he's BS! #Debates
#debatenight An audit means your being looked over by the criminal IRS
#Debates2016 Hillary look like she about to call BS on Trumps tax records 💀😭
i cant believe we have to choose between a racist cheeto and a snake. i miss bernie :(( #debatenight #FeelTheBern
"someone sitting on their bed weighing 400 lbs" just so hateful... can't leave some sort of name calling out #debatenight
@Andy if you can handle those crazy housewives, pleeeeease moderate these next debates!
@realDonaldTrump so you take advantage of the laws instead of being BETTER than that. I hope you get arrested soon! #debatenight
Fun fact: "Decimated" means "one out of every 10 killed." #debatenight  #Debates2016
Is Lester just there to hang out or is he going to moderate this debate? #Debates2016
Please tell me how your ten year old son and his laptop relates to national cyber security. Go on Don. #debates
Make America Great Again ! ..... and pay no taxes ? ..... that makes Donald smart ?  Doh ! #debatenight
Stop and frisk is unconstitutional regardless if it works or not. Trumps using the same argument he uses to justify torture #debatenight

This is Primary Trump. Primary Trump was hated by everyone but 1/3 of primary voters. #debatenight
Trump is simply better at debating than hilary and in my opinion the debates this time will make the difference.
#DonaldTrump says "Barack Obama" so much it appears he thinks he's running against Barack Obama. #debates
I just want a single sentence from Trump that doesn't mention how much he admires himself. #debatenight
Poor Mr. Trump doesn't understand stop and frisk issues. #debatenight Racial profiling
I love how @HillaryClinton calls him Donald. "Yeah, okay, pipe down, Donald." #debatenight
How did our nation get to the point where @realDonaldTrump is a serious contender for POTUS? I'm so ashamed. #Debates2016 #debatenight
Hey Donald, interrupting Hillary and saying "believe me" doesn't make you win the argument. #debatenight
Don't worry about killing someone will give you a second chance. WTF really! #debatenight
I can't stand Trump but I feel bad for him. Totally outclassed right now. #debates
Hilary answering questions,  while Trump is calculating his next rehursed jab, he's a joke. #debatenight
Debate Fact: Holt is the first non-animated American to be named 'Lester' #debates
So Trump looks like he's sucking a lemon as soon as she mentioned discrimination #debatenight
"These people" Trump just said that after Lester Holt pointed out Stop and Frisk resulted in racial profiling. #debatenight
Believe me, this #debatenight is total bullshit.  Trump is a blubbering idiot
Because it's totally Obama's fault for people's way of thinking and actions Smh Trump  #debatenight #Debates2016

Releasing emails for tax returns -- there you have our circus presidential  election election 2016  #debatenight #debates #Debates2016
Trump is a crooked businessman who is proud of unpaid wages &amp; taxes while blaming Clinton for bad roads/bridges (paid by taxes) #debatenight
Should I keep watching or should I put in a movie? My girls are really interested in this though... 🤔 #debatenight
Watch for it.  Hillary is going to Bait Donald on gun control... #debatenight

Trump's lip pursing makes me think this is what Bret Michaels will look like in 20 years. #debatenight #makeamericapoisonagain
Why would I watch the #Debates2016 when I could just stab myself in the eye?
Worst performance of the night: @Cardinals or the two "candidates" pretending that they're qualified to be president at #DebateNight ?
Clinton: "No one should disagree with the rights of the young men in those neighborhoods." #debatenight #EHShub
Clinton references Michelle Obama's quote "When they go low, we go high." in reference to Obama's response to Trump. #debatenight #EHShub
Trump says he has better judgement than Clinton does and that unlike her, he knows how to win. #debatenight #EHShub
Clinton explains how she put together a coalition to work with Iran and their nuclear deal. #debatenight #EHShub
Trump submitted Financial Disclosure Forn (FDF); has Hillary every submitted FDF? #Debates
They want to spend all this money that we don't have.. #debatenight
Trump: Take a left on Pennsylvania Avenue, turn right at the gas station, go for about half a mile til you see a big oak tree #debatenight
Brave move using ICE and ISIS in such quick succession, buddy #debatenight
she keeps saying fact checker!!!! does she know what that means#debatenight
"When they go low we go high" doesn't work that well when u remember obama uses a killer robot to murder ppl #debates
Much respect for @LesterHoltNBC for keeping his cool with this rude man on stage. ✌🏼️ #debate #Debates2016
Come for me, but don't you come for my friends. - Clinton face right now. #debates
#debatenight ~ Trump: When you try to act holier than thou, it doesn't work like that.
Maybe Donald needs to do some producing. How about starting with his tax returns!   #Debates2016
Hillary, girl I know you want to jump over that podium and attack Donald, but let's just chill okay, girl. #DebateNight
Donald Trump is a complete narcissist. We know you're the one that made it happen no need to continue mentioning it repeatedly. #DebateNight
#blackamerica is america. it's about time our "law and order" served and protected all americans #blacklivesmatter #debates
Oh shit, looks like Donny T figured out the cheat code where you say "wrong" into the mic a to force quit society #debatenight
Can we get started on a Birther-style movement to get Donald to release his tax returns? #debatenight #Debates2016
Trump endorses Stop and Frisk, an unconstitutional law. And this person could be appointing SC justices? #debatenight #Debates2016
Dear Donald, ISIS was formed by Bush's war in Iraq that gutted the Iraqi civil infrastructure. #debatenight
No, Donald. WE THE AMERICAN PEOPLE are angry because you need to release your taxes. #debatenight
Trump's lack of understanding of the English language and of grammar is simply unbelievable. #debatenight #ImWithHer #dumptrump @SophiaBush
@kfbuzinker racism means power * prejudice. there, I fixed it for you, it's that simple #debatenight
I'm from one county north- exactly what about palm beach is tough??! 😆😆 #debatenight
papa trumpu saying that not paying federal income tax makes him smart made me swallow my gum #Debates2016
Who wants to get drunk? Drinking game: Drinking every time Trump blows Clinton. #debatenight
there's nothing more american than two white people talking about race to a black man. #DebateNight
If you were take a drink every time Trump swiped his hand, you would be die 10 times. #debatenight
“I don’t think anyone knows it was Russia who hacked into the DNC?” — Trump. Actually almost everyone thinks it’s Russia. #debatenight
I'd like to see a live google trends feed for political terms said in tonight's debate. #debatenight
"Who was very against police" my undergrads can do better than that #debatenight
i mean obviously we want someone with no political experience running the country, right? #debatenight
Trump: "[President Obama] should've produced [his birth certificate] a long time ago."  You mean like your tax returns? 🐸☕ #debatenight
There is no "middle class". That's Marxist terminology, Hillary. We see through you. #CUTTAXESNOW #debatenight #debates #Debates2016
#debatenight Here we go again...Just talk about the cyber attack you helped cause.
Hillary's been preparing to be President since the good ole Bill days #socloseyetsofar #debates
Hills' eyes could cut glass bruh. That shade she's throwing got the debate room chilly af #debates #lowkeyscared #watchingcartoonsbeforebed
Hillary is speaking some sense and all Trump can say is "Typical politician." Where is his sense? #Debates2016
I just don't understand how we got to this point where these two are our only options for presidency... #debatenight
why can't trump just speak on the actual issues instead of talking so much shit #debatenight
Trump has no plan on ISIS. His plan is to ask the generals to come up with one 30 days after his inauguration. #Debates #debatenight
Someone explain to @realDonaldTrump that it's NOT a good look to insult the current president... Oh man lol awful #debatenight #Debates2016
Literally the biggest question in my mind. WHY ARE YOU NOT ALLOWED TO FLY BUT YOURE ALLOWED TO BUY A GUN?! #watchlist #debatenight
THIS MODERATOR IS EVEN LETTING DONALD TRUMP KNOW THAT HE'S AN IDIOT AND AMERICA DOESN'T SEE IT!! #Debates2016
Hah #HRC has skill in unethical practice, lying and laughing at the expense of children who were raped #Debates
The DNC hack showed the people how disgusting Dems are with what they said in those e-mails, their racist rants etc #Debates
This is the funniest south park episode I've seen in a while ! #debatenight #TurdSandwich or #GriantDouche?
lester: i would very much like to excluded from this narrative #debatenight
"we need law and order" yes i agree bring back christopher meloni to law and order svu #debatenight
"it could be Russia. it could be China. It could be a person who's 400 lbs sitting on their bed" #Debates2016
#Clinton telling #trump to pay his taxes 4 these roads &amp; airports was classic. I didn't know airports were the standard these days #debates
Who knew Trump would be such a good evangelist for GOP talking points on tax-breaks and regulations? Me.  #debates #debatenight #Debates2016
Trump made sure to pay homage to the flat-earthers/science deniers by slamming #ClimateChange out of the blue  #debatenight #debates
Clinton says she's prepared for this debate and she's also prepared to be POTUS. The crowd cheers. #HSMpolitics #TeamStyl #Debates2016
"Bring back law &amp; order." 🙄 Be more vague. Clearly doesn't have an actual plan. Just keeps talking about the current situation. #debatenight
How many times are you gonna pat yourself on the back for being ignorant #debates
Wipe that simpleminded smile off your face @HillaryClinton you look like an idiot #debatenight
"woah, I have to respond" "ok"  god. damnit.   #Debates
#debatenight Why Hillary and the Democrats haven't implemented the plans they now so surely claim will be the greatest for the economy?
This debate is truly going to go on forever if he doesn't stop interrupting people. 😭 #Debates
Wait... Did he just admit to not paying tax.. "It would have been squandered too.." #debatenight
Listening to 2 whining babies in the big world while being tired. Feels like ppl trying to shove false info into you. #Debates2016
Trump's glass would be empty by now if he were drinking. He is taking a mouthful of water then spitting it back out. #cyborg #debatenight
I don't know how Hillary is keeping it together. She has more self-control than ANY man or woman in history. #Debates2016
"i say nothing" because i didn't let him finish the question #debatenight
#debatenight Once again Trump pats himself on the back for his racist #birtherism attack against President Obama. #VileBigot
Trump says he doesn't pay if pple don't do a good job. This isn't IKEA trump! You can't return a building if you don't like it #debatenight
Trump has admitted he pays no fed income taxes and it's OK to stiff contractors. #debates live
Trump to be clear you're talking about taking guns away from people who aren't white. Read Freakonomics re:NYC crime dude #Debates2016
Clinton doing well. Pity the rambling buffoon beside her keeps interrupting her with buzzwords like "wrong". #debatenight #ImWithHer
The Trump meltdown will soon be coming.  You don't learn anything from tax reports what a liar #ReleaseTheReturns  #debatenight
Hillary is getting run over. Trump is the Mack Truck. Ruthless performance so far. #debatenight
Hilary remains poised as ever while Trump gets more worked up. #girlpower #debatenight #ImWithHer
So American nerds/ hackers are 400 pounds, lol.  Sure Donald. #realworld  #debatenight
More self praise,  I count 7 times that last segment #debatenight
Law and order is a good show, but an actual plan would be better, well said Hilary #debatenight #trumpedup
Ask him about his tiny hands and let's see that temperament switch up #debates
So much passion, I bet the sex between those two would be HOT!!! #debatenight
Trump: I can't release my tax returns I'm being audited  FBI: you can release them man Trump: Audit AuditEmailAuditEMail AUDit #debatenight
Trump trying to shout down Clinton seems like a tactic to drown out her details in her plans #Debates2016
Iran is almost up to pre-sanction oil production since the Iran Deal #Debates2016
God, I hope Lester's rider is nothing but whiskey and a baby pool full of Xanax waiting for him in his dressing room. #debatenight
Wait, did Trump just tip his hand that he'd put his 10-year-old son in charge of cybersecurity? #Debates2016
@BernieSanders Massive regulations &amp;  litigious society make every business exposed to lawsuits. #debates
Someone please tell Trump that the debate is with Hillary and not the moderator. #Debates2016
Shut the hell up #Lester! @NBC this guy is a left wing hack! #debatenight
Trump named at least 5 countries so far, he knows EVERYTHING #debatenight  Mexico China Isis - it's a country right? Putin Syria
Am I dumb? I just have no idea what Trump is banging on about most of the time. #debatenight
He knows he's over, he doesn't know how to answer  #debatenight
"[...] a couple of words: law and order" THATS THREE WORDS, TRUMP #factcheck #debatenight
Do you think Hillary is looking at notes? Why is she looking down so much? #debatenight
@realDonaldTrump  i will released my tax returns when hilary shows us those 30 thousand deleted emails lmao!! #debatenight
Law and order, law and order ... Where's #OliviaBenson we need her to #StopAndFrisk Trump? #debatenight @Mariska #ImWithHer
Yeah what a great success that's been MT @asamjulian: Hillary "I've been senator and secretary of state" as a rebuttal to Trump #DebateNight
When he keeps getting off topic 🙄 &amp; that sniffing is too much for us watching 😬🙃 #debatenight
Trump is just a bunch of sound bites with nothing in between.  And what is with the sniffling!  He must be sick.  #debatenight
clearly not winning there @realDonaldTrump why do you never pay your fair share you douchebag? Oh wait #blamehilary #Debates
Goddamnit, @POTUS why did you build so many shitty airports. You're really screwing up Hillary. #debatenight
#debatenight  Did he just say the Persian Gulf War was her fault too?
What are you going to do to make things better in our country; not hearing much of that on either side 😩 #DebateNight
Wait. WAIT..... Does Donald "The Art of the Deal" Trump not know what the word "negotiable" means? #debatenight #Debates2016
"Lots of other companies were sued for racism too!" Good excuse @realDonaldTrump. #debatenight
So Donald are you gonna raise the taxes or lower?..you gotta pick one #debatenight
Wow....I didn't know myself, my friends, and family are living in hell. Thanks Trump🙄 #debatenight
I hate how @realDonaldTrump in his stupidity is blaming blacks for the criminal issues America faces. Whites are criminals too  #Debates2016
Here's the interesting thing...Hillary's comments about cooperation with Muslims echo W's words immediately following 9/11 #debatenight
LAW AND ORDER CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM LAW AND ORDER GREAT IDEA I'D RATHER BE WATCHING SVU #debatenight
Trickle down does not resonate. No one knows what that refers to. She's reliving the 80s. #debatenight
"You know what else I prepared for? TO BE PRESIDENT." Mic drop #2!!! #Debates
Howwwwwww can one man so blithely lie, get called on it, tweak but still lie, and then nod like, yeah, of course?  #Debates
fake #debates don't watch them.. the Jews "AIPAK" are the presidents of America .. 🙂
South Park is real I'm watching a turd sandwich and doosh #debates
Mr. Trump, please just answer the question. Whether you have investments or none is not concerning to us. #debatenight
So the 15 min ecomomy bit is now half an hour?  #debatenight
Maybe we'll get to know his african american (it's Louis Farrakhan anyway) #debatenight #PresidentialDebate
WTF was that satanic feedback on Trump's mic rite now? I thought Hill was the "luciferian" haha #debatenight
You know what else determines what kind of education poor people get, @HillaryClinton? Taking away their school vouchers! #debates
WHY IS TRUMP SUPPORTING STOP &amp; FRISK?!  Actually. Keep doing it. Dig yourself deeper, pal.   #debatenight #Debates2016
Fuck... Law &amp; Order comes on Wednesday nights at 8 central... Damn he promoting 😏 #debatenight
Mistake? Lady way bigger than just a mistake. Classified stuff was in there give me a break. #debatenight
If you're watching this debate and are just having a bad time remember the Warriors STILL blew a 3-1 lead  #debatenight
I always keep my eye on the Time Of Possession clock during 🏈 games. Serious question: Is there one on #Debates2016 for answer length?
Who wanna send me back to Africa? Because these candidates are trash 🙄#debatenight
This is a mess. This debate is just showing the world what a joke our political system is. #Debates2016
Let Donald get in that white house if you want to. He's gonna sell everything in there. #debatenight
People are supposed to pay their taxes, you are not smart, you are affecting the government you want to run #debatenight
I want @SenSanders and @GovGaryJohnson to drop in, political ninja style, and legitimize the fuck out of this #debatenight
Because Stop and Frisk is an excellent platform to present.  What...  #debates
Lester Holt is a coward; completely unwilling to stop Trump from yelling incoherent bullshit #DebateNight
Step 1: Replace "tax return" with "Goldman Sachs transcripts" Step 2: Appreciate some irony #debatenight
So there are bad things going on. Some very bad things.  #Debates2016
@Cgzinsou Always best to be an informed, even if #Debates2016 is utterly ridiculous.
Of course trump wants stop and frisk which is only bias against poc  #debates
I'm going to call Sean Hannity to see if he knows the mystery 400lbs man #Debates2016
Is he saying anything?  It sounds like blah blah blah goobledegook.  #debates #debate2016
No difference bw our politicians and Trump. They both don't declare their assets  #debatenight
Trump's defense against troubling facts is "I know you are but what am I." #debatenight #ClintonVsTrump #debate2016
If that is the real Donald Trump, I honestly have no clue how he runs his business. How he was even successful. #debatenight
He did not just go on a rant and then go I have better temperament than her  #debatenight
It was funny over the summer but really can't see the humor in the elections anymore #debatenight
Implicit bias is a problem for everyone, and hopefully, a budget item. BOOM.  #HillaryClinton #debates #crotchchop
"...a very against police judge... You need stop and frisk...more police." -potential future president of the US #debatenight
"Woooh, Okay!" YOU GOT THIS @HillaryClinton EVERYONE THIS IS CALLED INFORMATION &amp; FACTS #debatenight on @periscopetv
@realDonaldTrump is all over the place ! mocking @HillaryClinton thats what is going on in #Debatenight #Debates
So if you listen to Shillary, she pauses between words. She is more then definitely wearing a head piece.  #debatenight #Debates2016
So @realDonaldTrump says we need Law &amp; Order. I agree. @Mariska Hargitay would slay this. #debates2016
Did Trump just scoff and roll his eyes when HC said stop and frisk didn't work and was actually racist? #Debates2016
Why can't we mute their mic when it isn't their turn to speak? #debates
Trump will increase spending, cut taxes and reduce or debt. 🤔 #Trumponomics #debatenight
#Debates Trump needs to calm down and stop interrupting it's hurting him
Trump consistently make the phrase "thou doth protest too much" echo in my mind #Debates2016 #debates
Donald Trump-I'm very proud of all the great credit I have gotten for not discriminating against anyone at one club in Florida #debatenight
Questions of the night: Will Trump put together a single cogent sentence? #Debates
...Did Trump just say that he single-handedly helped get NATO in the Middle East? #Debates2016
.@realDonaldTrump doesn't know how to "heal" any sort of "divide" that's why he suggests #stopandfrisk as #lawandorder #debatenight
"I've been all over the place."  In your policies. Right? #debatenight #ImWithHer
This feels more like a middle school fight then a presidential debate. #debatenight
Trump makes good point - she's been trying to get Isis for a long time. Disaster. #Debates2016
Wait! Trump is the one who wants to take away guns? #debatenight
Oh my gosh, think about the people at the UN that would have to translate these Trumpian word salads for the ear pieces. #debatenight
Fact check the endorsement for DT from 200 Admirals and Generals #debatenight
Did he seriously just insist that he has a better temperament? 😂 #debatenight
"Like your president thinks." Wait. Is he admitting that he's not American? #Debates2016
Hey @realDonaldTrump I'm a big fan of guns. I still agree 100% with @HillaryClinton #debatenight
Empty words shouting endless nonsense phrases, is Trumpqualified to even be in this debate #debatenight
Trump: "I also have a much better temperament than she has."  Crowd: *low laughter*  #Debates2016
Donnie got the Obamma birth cert.. But it was shown in 2011.. Don made Obamma produce it.. WTH #Debates
One action leads to another... He is a quiet nationalist today..tomorrow. Loud again... #Debates
What was that nonsense Trump just mouthed out to the microphone? 😂#Debates2016
I hope #HillaryClinton was baking cookies while she was 'staying home' according to #Trump #Debates2016
There is absolutely zero risk in releasing your tax returns while they're under audit. What are you hiding Donald? #debates
Donald Trump keeps sniffling, is he sick, on coke, what's the deal.  #debatenight
Don't look at my tax return, just read my statement. Cuz he's so much more honest than Hillary #debatenight
"The have the oil all over the place, a lot of the oil.. most of the oil in Libya" #debatenight #Debates
Did he just start taking about airports? Like the cause of bad economy is lack of #aubonpain #Debates2016 #mia2
#debates Trumps lie about his taxes being audited so he can't release them.  Call him on it, everybody.
#debates Trump's problem is that he doesn't know what he doesn't know
Lest we forget, Chicago does have the toughest gun laws in the United States #DebateNight
Y'all gonna elect a president who blackmails people over something so petty as emails and tax returns. You gonna get us bombed. #debatenight
How can you say you did not say you were FOR the war in Iraq? Jesus. #debatenight
Lester comes through with #stopandfrisk fact check, but @realDonaldTrump says he's wrong? What the...?!? #Debates2016
In 1973 Trump started his career being sued by the justice department for racial discrimination #debates
So is trump going to actually answer this question or keep repeating the death toll... #debatenight
.@HillaryClinton says we must address systemic racism in the criminal justice system #debatenight
.@HillaryClinton says she wants to take out ISIS leadership and make it a top priority #debatenight

The record shows it was you!  The mainstream media put out tape of HIM supporting the war in Iraq. #debatenight
Trump brings LOLs: "I think my strongest asset, maybe by far, is my temperament. I have a winning temperament. I know how to win." #debates
The only moderator that's going to be able to manage a debate with Trump in it is a cattle prod. #debatenight

Trump: hey, yous gots a nice country, NATO ally, be a shame if something was to happen to it... #Debates
On a scale from 1-10, how much does Obama want to give Trump a Stone Cold stunner after watching this debate? #debatenight
This is pure bullshit.  It's on the record that he supported the war.  He is treasonous.  I'm done #LyingDonald #debates #TrumpforWar
Trump has me almost convinced to vote Hillary ... ALMOST....  #debatenight
Wait... Wth did he just say. I am,confused! @realDonaldTrump dear God don't let either of them be our #POTUS2016  #debatenight

"The politicians make the worst laws ever! They are destroying this great country!" #debates
It's hard to listen to you with a straight face 😂💀 #DebateNight #ImWithHer

"A man who can be provoked by a tweet should not have his finger anywhere near the nuclear button" - @HillaryClinton  #syrrelpol #debates

Fyi the reason she not fighting trump is bc its not in her script ✋🏼 #debates
The military people who endorsed Trump are older than the Beetle Bailey comic strip. #debates #debatenight #ImWithHer #Debates2016 @cspanwj
Trump just said "wrong" when Clinton said the real estate mogul has praise for Putin. #debatenight
Whooo @HillaryClinton attacking the Trump ego ! "He's not as Rich as he says" LOL #debatenight
The fact that Sean Hannity "called [Trump] the other day" tells you everything you need to know. #debatenight
Chynah Chynah Chynah... really though he's right most of this segment. Clinton can't talk on cyber security. #debates
@realDonaldTrump: Barack Obama and Hillary for long have spoken of taking out ISIS,and failed #debatenight
"I haven't given a lot of thought to NATO." Yeah we know. #Hilary is qualified,  #debatenight #debates #Debates2016
.@realDonaldTrump seems confused on nuke strategy. I wouldn't do 1st strike... and I wouldn't take anything off table. @wusa9 #debatenight
Based on this debate, there's no way a person unfamiliar with Trump would think his first language was English #debatenight
Why is the audio getting louder and then quieter all the time? #debates
TRICKLE DOWN DID NOT WORK. PLEASE GOD SAY IT LOUDER FOR THE PEOPLE IN THE BACK WHO TIPPED IN LATE #Debates2016

The VP debates are prolly gonna be more productive than this horseshit
#debatenight Trump was NEVER a politician, he had nothing to do with any war or other disaster these politicians created.
She wants to be president , Not at the head in FORBES #debatenight
Wait if crime is down from 91 then what is the big deal Hillary? #debatenight
Hillary term "super predator" ... was she referring to her husband?  #debatenight
#debatenight "Upset with politicians have told them and what politicians have done." Hillary "I think Trump insulted me" ???
Let's start the clock again YASSSS THAT SHOULD LITERALLY BE THE CAMPAIGN SLOGAN #DebateNight
#debatenight It is so interesting how Trump isn't answering any questions with any details or specifics, only criticism about everything???!
The most important thing you have to do about racism is put racist, murderous cops in prison. #debates
When does @LesterHoltNBC show up? I'm anxious for the debate to get started. #Debates
Does Trump have a cold or what the heck is with the sniffling? #debatenight
You know, I love a good trainwreck as much as the next person, but I just can't stomach this #debatenight much longer
These two ass clowns are the biggest ass clowns that ever did clown #Debates2016
The problem is I'm getting a little motion sickness trying to follow Trump's arguments.  #debatenight
Trump: My strongest asset is my temperament.  - Donald, that's what the rest of us are afraid of. #debatenight
Law and Order/ Stop and Frisk. #debatenight  Illegal immigrant gangs. He sounds like this is a dystopian world.
Twitter is full of tweets from people hearing what they want to hear from Trump and Hillary. #debatenight
"Our country is suffering because people like Secretary Clinton have made such bad decisions in terms of our jobs." —Donald Trump #debates

who says hillary isn't funny. that whoo-eeee before she started talking just now was INCREDIBLE #debatenight
Do not blame one person (Barack Obama) for the race relations of a whole country. This has been going on for many years. #DebateNight
Border Patrol would endorse #TrumpDump . They're getting more help from him than any other job. #debatenight
@sammikates He thinks that because they're not made of gold, it means they're third-world. #debatenight
If Donald's temperament is his biggest asset, it's worse than I thought  #debatenight
New contingency every time someone asks him to release his taxes. What're you hiding? #cbsnreax #debatenight
That sounds a little feudalistic. "They should be paying us for protection" We going back to medieval times?#Debates2016 #debatenight

Her glare is giving me all the strength I will ever need. #debatenight
Who cares about your clubs?!? Who cares about your property. Please stop talking about it #debatenight #Debates2016
Everything is the worst deal- NAFTA, CAFTA, Iran, Free trade, capitalism, debt, all the worst #debatenight
@HillaryClinton insinuated that @realDonaldTrump  isn't as rich as he claims... she clearly has him flustered!   #debates
Listening to #debatenight on radio. Is #Trump doing lines of coke or something? Constant sniffing.
If he trolled her like this, he'd be nothing but a misogynist. You can use the cutsie laugh when you're a woman. #debatenight
Hell, go ahead and make Hillary president of the Universe after this debate. #debatenight
how much is this man going to talk about his garbage business rather than his presidency? #debatenight
#Debates He is a bully! He is only attacking her, interrupting her... just stay ON TOPIC!! Please!
DRUMPF is Racist. There are no other words for it.  #Debates2016
Trump is a Misogynist. We don’t even talk about it any more because his controversies are so numerous. #Debates2016
"I have a much better temperament than Mrs Clinton"... *cue audible crowd laughter* #debatenight #dumpsterfire2016

NASA somehow can select the most sane people to fly to space but it's ok for politicians to be demented crooks #Debates
Even a dummy like me knows that those countries actually do pay us... #debatenight
@realDonaldTrump doesn't matter if they did a good job or not. He deserved to be paid. #debates
: I honestly want to see Trump choke on that water and Hillary give him CPR, save him, then beat his ass in the poles ... #Debates2016
"I've been audited every year for 15 years." Not exactly a ringing self-endorsement. #debatenight
"I have investments in Charlotte." "I have property in Chicago."  The man cares about one thing. #debatenight
#Debates2016    Did he just say he takes advantage of the laws of the nation?!
Trump there is OVERWHELMING evidence proving you supported the invasion of Iraq. #debates
Did he just say we have became a 3rd world country? #DebateNight
Did Trump say "These People..." this type of divisive speech is reckless for a POTUS. #Debates2016
Why does #Hillary keep smiling? There's nothing funny about what's being said! She's medicated! Something is up with her #Debates2016
YOU HAVE NO IDEA TO BUY STUFF. HOW MANY TIMES HAVE YOU BEEN BANKRUPT?! #Debates2016
The best thing Hillary can do is continue to be quite and let Donnie talk #2016debate #debatenight
Donald talking over everyone and Hillary's shit eating grin are killing me! #Debates2016
"Have you seen Copland? Very good film. I will make America Copland for real!" #debatenight
Trump insists on doing debates indoors bc a large gust of wind would reveal that he's just a tall pile of angry melting money  #debatenight

Man running to be POTUS and determine federal spending claims that paying zero federal income tax makes me smart #debatenight
Trump has yet to actually say anything at all. He's sticking to huge statements that are neither here nor there. #Debates
Lester: Stop &amp; Frisk was ruled unconstitutional for targeting POC. Trump: No, you're wrong. The judge was biased.  No, Donald. No. #Debates
A presidential candidate who doesn't pay any federal tax. 🙄🙄🙄 dump the trump  #Debates2016
Oh shit, here comes the race portion of the evening. Nothing says I understand like two rich white people. #DebateNight

#Debates2016   Trickle down did not bring the recession. Something for nothing did.  People buying houses given loans they couldn't afford.
#debatenight @realDonaldTrump's stop and frisk approach would violate the 4th and 14th Amendments, as well as his precious 2d Amendment
#debatenight good question, Lester, about home-grown terrorism.  @realDonaldTrump doesn't answer the question.  No surprise.
#debatenight Bravo, Lester, for calling @realDonaldTrump on his lie about opposing our invasion of Iraq #LoveTrumpsHate and #TruthTrumpsLies
Don wants Stop and Frisk, AKA kiss your civil rights bye. No thanks, I ❤️ the US Constitution. #LoveTrumpsHate #ImpactMatters #Debates2016
President's don't run countries Donald.. They lead. There's a huge difference #debatenight
Hillary's playing it safe w criticism of police, but I'm okay w it for now #debates
@davidaxelrod @HillaryClinton makes her seem cocky and overconfident, she needs to remember she might actually lose to a chimp #debatenight
Didn't we go into a recession in the late 80's because of #ReagaNomics? #debatenight
#debatenight yet mental health was brought before the Senate and Democrats voted against it.
Trump wants good deals for America...he knows good deals because he's using campaign cash to enrich himself #bestdealever #debatenight
#Debatenight #News3LV .@News3LV  CLINTON:  We have to restore trust between communities and police.
#Debatenight #News3LV .@News3LV CLINTON:  We have got to address the systemic injustices in our system.
#Debatenight #News3LV .@News3LV CLINTON:  I think Donald just prepared me for preparing for this debate.  I'm also prepared to be President.
Fun fact: presidents are trapped in golf courses for eternity after they've finished their term. #debatenight #accordingtotrump
Hillary is handling Trump being a bully like such a boss. 🙌 #DebateNight
It's funny how trump never answers the questions he always blaming people instead of saying what you are going to improve  #Debates
Still waiting for Donald to finish a sentence without interrupting himself. #Debates2016 #debatenight
Winning temperament? OMG! Is this the real llfe? Or just a fantasy? #debates2016 #debatenight
The US can't steal the oil of another sovereign nation. That would piss off govts and radicals alike. #debatenight
Trump missed huge opportunity to blast Hillary's incompetence on internet security .   #debatenight
Settling lawsuits w no admission of guilt doesn't mean that Trump isn't racist #debatenight
is it me or they're not mentioning policies just attacking each other #debatenight @jimmy_dore @DrJillStein
Thank GOD….Really…..that #Trump got Obama to produce the birth certificate, and did him that favour. A debt is owed. #Debates2016
I sincerely hope no one is playing a drinking game with the sniff #thesniff #debatenight
Trump is more interested in boasting about his failing businesses than talking about actual issues. #DebateNight
IF YOU HAVE SO MUCH COMMON SENSE, WHY AREN'T YOU ANSWERING THE QUESTION--WHICH IS WHAT COMMON SENSE WOULD DICTATE? #debatenight
Just in case we need to said it again : since WW1, the USA are not the underdog anymore #debatenight
Beware, Trump's 10 years old son might be able to use Office and Facebook. Soon, he will be a international-level hacker #debatenight
After this debate is over @HillaryClinton is going to walk off stage go into a room and laugh for 20 mins. #debates
Trump heard cavalier use by Clinton. Wanted to use cavalier because she has better words. #Debates
Both these candidates are doing a terrible job...this is just sad... #debatenight
When most of your answers involve the phrase "believe me!" it's hard to... well, believe you. #debatenight

Do we need to talk about the things YOU've said that I thought were horrible things Donald???? #debatenight
Yeaaaaaaaaaah, you did support the war in Iraq. For the record. #debatenight

This isn't a debate. It's a circus. And Trump is the clown running around in the middle, making an ass of himself. #DebateNight #Debates2016
Most street gangs are illegal immigrants? When was the last time you even saw "The Street" from your tax evading high rise? #DebateNight

Hey, @LesterHoltNBC I'd like to know what HRC and DT would do about Cyber security #debatenight #Debates2016
And, I'm sorry [or, not], there is no healing the racial divide. #debatenight
Trump: "I take advantage of the laws of the nation." Can't wait to see how he takes advantage of presidency. #debatenight
Plot twist: Trump and Hillary end with an intense makeout session on stage. #debatenight
Why would anyone want to have a egotistical, racists, irrational, crazy person as their president?? #crazytrump #Debates2016
You wanna build roads, schools, hospitals, airports? It's gonna take TAXES! #debatenight
The debate in a nutshell: jobs, tax records, emails, Mexico, new Trump hotel, trade deals ... rinse, repeat.  #debates #debatenight
When talking about police brutality, NO ONE CARES where ur investments are .@realDonaldTrump !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! #debates

I'd call you a child, @realDonaldTrump but I don't want to disrespect children #Debates2016
What? But you were "Annie Oakley", Clinton! But that was when you were lobbying for the 'right' votes. Haa. #debatenight
Has anyone realized our candidates on stage right now are wearing colors opposite of their political party?! #debatenight
This looks like a middle school argument in the playground during recess #debatenight
I hate this debate! They both suck! He's got the sniffles and she's got a nervous smile. Don't trust either of them!! #debatenight
"...which showed he didn't pay any federal income tax."  "Which makes me smart."  #debates
"A man who can be provoked by a tweet should not have access to the nuclear codes." YES. #debates
Why do his hands belong to another person like a dead person?  #debatenight
Can we just keep Obama in office for four more years?  #debatenight
By the way, how long do you think it would take to "take the oil?" It's about commodity transportation infrastructure.   #debatenight
Lol, Why would China invade North Korea? How would that benefit them?  #debatenight
"If you are a young African American man doing the same thing as a young White American man [...]" She went there!!! #Debates2016 #ImWithHer
If Hillary could never stare directly into my soul for that long again that'd be chill. #Debates2016
Someone said to turn off their mics when it isn't their turn? @LesterHoltNBC get on that please #debates
So if we went in and took the oil there would be no ISIS? Because that's the way it works? #Debates2016
I'm disappointed in Lester Holt!!! We need a moderator who will stand up to this lying BULLY! #Debates2016
In a STOP and FRISK nation just how often does Trump really believe that white people would be affected by this?? Hot air!! #Debates2016
.@realDonaldTrump tax records will be released once he’s out of an audit? What? Why is he in one right now? #DebateNight
“A man who can be provoked by a tweet…“ Are we talking @MeekMill or @realDonaldTrump? #Debates #DebateNight
@HillaryClinton: I prepared  for this Debate and I'm prepared to be #POTUS. #PresidentialDebate #debatenight
Stop lying on illegal immigrants. Guns are being sold to them from the USA  #debatenight
@GhostPanther higher minimum wage meh. Need people to get an education and better their lives. Fair taxes yes though. #Debates2016
Trump: "I don't do nasty commercials on you. Maybe I'm trying to save the money."  WTF!  #debatenight #Debates2016
What's the point of having a Moderator that isn't respected and ignored when telling both parties to STFU?#DebateNight
Is one murder too many? Because Donald says he could go out and murder someone and it wouldn't lose him any votes, so... #debates
She looks so poised, elegant, even amused. God, I wish I had her nerves and her patience.  #debates
Can I opt-in having only hot cops stop and frisk me? #debates
Trump decided he was against a war AFTER he read an article on a major magazine #debatenight

If you hear someone tell you "Believe me" constantly, would you? #debatenight
Donald, "bigly" is not a word. Stop trying to make "bigly" happen. #debatenight
Bring up what HE said about "#2A people", #Hillary! KO to the #TrumpTrain! Why's he sniffing? #cocainepsychosis #debates #debatenight
Lester: what do you think about global warming Mr Trump?  Trump: this stupid cow in red has done a horrible job, factssssss  #debates

"My obligation right now is to do well for myself." Yeah, we get that about you. #debatenight
Well, Trump is correct again: having a private server is not a "mistake." #debatenight
Oh no, Trump's talking about stealing oil from countries we invade... #debatenight
"The oil is all over the place." In the words of @GeorgeTakei, oh my. #debatenight
Hillary is doing a decent job of giving Trump time to unfurl his own rope. And only slightly rolling her eyes. #DebateNight #fb
"implicit bias is a problem for everyone, not just the police" Policing can have "fatal consequences". #ImWithHer #debatenight
I'm pretty sure he just said he's going to take away guns.  #debatenight  #NRA
LAW AND ORDER SO TRUE #wecalltheblue #scalable. Hillary skirting issue for votes. WE MUST HAVE LAW AND ORDER AS TRUMP SAYS #debatenight
Anytime you ask a conservative something threatening, bait and switch. Can't answer questions. #debatenight
As I predicted: Hilary camp fainting over her and Trump folks going into fits over him. Meanwhile, America is in trouble. #debatenight
Yes police are absolutely biased to black people Black Men Are Anyone Close #debatenight #TonyRed
@HillaryClinton is the only one that can hold the Presidential title. She listens first. @realDonaldTrump reacts off the wall.#Debates
Lester Holt is a darn fine moderator in the mold of Jim Lehrer. #DebateNight
C'mon Donald we all know that birth certificate is forged asamf #debates
Hillary needs a Donald stand-in to curse out when this is over. You know there are some bad words running through her head!  #debates
trump: talks about race and uses the word investment within the first 10 words #Debates
did he just describe himself but then call it secretary clinton #debatenight
694M$ Just think what wld happen if #Trump gave his income this yr to charity. You know, feed the hungry, train people for jobs #Debates2016
Hillary: Maybe he's not rich, maybe not charitable, maybe pays zero taxes. #Debates
Clinton one murder is too many and I fully agreed to that #debatenight
@ClintSmithIII Well, because Clinton has only *not* done one of those things as far as I know (not paying people). #debatenight
Trump is talking over a black man about how he lied to delegitimize the first black president. #debatenight
Lester Holt plays the race card. Hillary claims race is an issue. #FactCheck.false Bloomberg TV #debatenight #MediaBias
I had to pause the DVR, and go outside after Lester &amp; Hillary played several race cards in a row. Pandering to #POC #FactCheck #debatenight
Trump says he's under routine audit and when it's done, his taxes will be released #debates #debatenight
Trump: "We have to stop the violence and bring back law and order." #debates
Clinton: "We've got to address the systemic racism in our criminal justice system." #debates
The "Trump International" company isn't one of Trump's companies. He just licenses his name to them. He didn't build it. #debatenight
Hillary is amazing at jabbing Trump by reminding everyone of things like Michele's stolen speech without actually saying it. #debatenight
Yo Newark is a shithole but you can fuck yourself bloody for saying it's 3rd world like fucking really???????? #debatenight
Trump won't answer the question. He had no answer. Appreciate Lester pushing. #Debates2016
Lester is that kid in grade school who tried to keep the peace but was always drowned out #debatenight
Is Trump's policy really "take all of the oil out of Iraq"?  #DebateNight
Idk why they don't have @rolandsmartin moderate one of these debates I bet Trump wouldn't be pointing his finger and telling him to wait
650 million is "not a lot of money." @realDonaldTrump is a man of a people. #Cato2016 #Debates2016
Trump "takes advantage of the laws of the nation." Doesn't that sound terrifying in a president? #debates2016 #Cato2016
@LizzieGarrick debate on hold watching a cunt fight a dick on the #debatenight later gee
Lester needs to grow bigger balls tonight!!! They are running all over him!  #debatenight
Trump judging the amount of respect Hillary gave to Obama is amazing. #debatenight
So Trump doesn't like to be interrupted but he can interrupt everyone else 🤔 oh okay #debatenight
I'm thinking Trump bringing up old statements made by Clinton might backfire. @sternshow #DebateNight
Hillary's upside is that she gets paid, doesn't owe like Trump. I feel better about #power. #debatenight
We have spent the past hour &amp; a half 'debating' on the past, when we should be focused on our future. #Debates2016 🇺🇸
Incompetent Orange-Faced Hitler vs Corrupt Lying Lizard-Woman What a choice you've got, America. #debatenight #debates
Hillary is done...President Trump is going to take oath on next Jan 20th.... #debatenight #Debates2016
"Sometimes there's not a direct transfer of skills from business to government." That's pretty much the line of the night. #Debates2016
The first solid details he's presented all night are which campaign people were on which talk shows. #debatenight
Settlements ALWAYS have no admission of guilt-That's the point of a SETTLEMENT, DumbAss. Everyone knows this.   #debatenight
When #Trump talks about our economic problems he never mentions it started with good old boys like his father #debatenight
The race situation. I feel like Clinton lacks in this area #Debates2016
just rambling and deflecting #Debates2016 #debatenight JFC how'd he get this far in?!
Lester, you are allowing Trump to change the subject when he can't answer your questions! #maddow #debatenight
4 years from now some democratic candidate is going to be bragging about getting @realDonaldTrump to produce his tax returns #debatenight
Take the oil. Trump don't know we can't pillage and plunder? #debatenight
Is it me, or is the ENTIRE COUNTRY literally watching the BEST comedy skit of all time? #debatenight @realDonaldTrump @HillaryClinton
You know what might help get guns away from people who shouldn't have them? Background checks. #debatenight
Is it just me, or is The Donald less orange than usual? #debates
Did Trump just brag several several several times that he is a billionaire? Fact check: Yes #Debates
It's like someone gave Trump every edition of the Chicago Tribune since January. #debatenight
Btw Trump was absolutely promoting his new Trump property in Washington in case you were wondering #Debates2016
Hillary's "fact-checking" failing to check any of her blatant lies on Iran and NATO. #debatenight #debates
Bring back Law and Order! When did that show get cancelled again? #debatenight
Side note: @ChefDavidBurke, you feeling good about being in business with this man? Is the money worth it? Won't be forgotten #debatenight
It's obvious that #Clinton's general strategy for #DebateNight is "Let #Trump talk as looong as possible".
Might as well let Stein and Johnson in on the debates...
@realDonaldTrump you didn't have to address ridiculous conspiracy theories to move on to even more ridiculous and fake issues #debates
Clinton is right on about implicit bias. It's a growing movement in police researchers. #debates
Trump seems 2 think "stop &amp; frisk" is a gang disarmament program. #debatenight
Trump: I'll release my tax returns as soon as she [Clinton] releases her 33,000 emails #debatenight
Clinton: I prepared for this debate and I prepared to be President, and I think that's a good thing #debatenight
"You have to understand I'm a business person, I did really well!" Lols. #debatenight
This is why @TonyReali needs to moderate on of these debates, @AroundtheHorn style. #debatenight  #Debates2016
We can't really have Law and Order now that Jerry Orbach died. #Debates2016 #debatenight
The lesser of two evils going at each other's evils lmaoo this shits a joke  #Debates
How can you support a man that blatantly rips off the people who work hard for this country. Disgusting. #DebateNight
The NRA didn't support the bill Hillary was referencing, but Trump still has their enforcement and agrees with her... #debatenight
omg. Lester Holt mentions illegality of stop/frisk...omg. Trump trashes judge who ruled it unconstitutional. #Debates2016
Trump slags off the media but then wants "the press" to run his errands to interview...umm...Sean Hannity? Yeah ok. #debates
Did I just see HRC scratch her cheek with her middle finger... #Debates
Stop and frisk...do you know who the majority would be that would be stopped and frisked?! Yeah. People who aren't white. #DebateNight
Donald has only 5 sentences and all he does is repeat them. No real answers. No real plans. Racist, misogynistic, bullshitter #Debates2016
Hillary Clinton attacks Trump by saying he has something to hide. #whatemails #DebateNight
Apparently we've become a third world country because of our airports #DebateNight
Trump just looked into the camera like he was on the episode of the office😂 #DebateNight
"I take advantage of the laws of the nation." --The Republican nominee for the presidency of the US #debatenight
I'm turning off this debate if the next question is not about harambe #realissues #dicksout #debatenight
I was thinking about that doing that debate drinking game and since I started pouring alcohol I haven't stopped #debatenight
From the 12yo, "If this dude wins, it's going to be the Hunger Games." #PresidentialDebate #debatenight #Debates2016
This is like watching someone do precision surgery on the Tasmanian devil #debatenight
Is there something in the podium that feeds info to the candidates?  Lots of eyes down.  #debatenight
Trump, I feel like you should know that Hillary's President is also your's Its just like part of the job.  #debatenight
Trump wants to take away guns from "gangs and people that use them." Isn't that everyone? #debates
I had no idea Palm Beach, FL is the most wealthy place in the world. @realDonaldTrump what a dipshit. #debatenight #Debates2016
Oh Donald ... as someone who grew up in Dubai, I can tell you horror stories about how that "beautiful airport" was built. #DebateNight
"I also have a much better temperament than she does" ... as he has *clearly* demonstrated tonight. #DonaldTrump #DebateNight
You don't pay taxes but you want #NATO to pay their fair share... #debatenight  #SmartPeopleDontPayTaxes #NATOisDumb
I do believe Dandy Don has a serious case of cotton mouth. He's dying out there. Maybe he'll drop dead? #debatenight
The Birther story......oh please....that's old news....what difference does it make?? ...bias media at work again...#Debates
Secretary Clinton's face when Lester asked her to comment on Obama's birth certificate hahahahahaha 😂😂😂 #debatenight
Seriously @realDonaldTrump ? Stop and frisk is ok? No....would you do it? #debatenight
@FoxNews #debatenight Students purchased their debt due to educators promoting college. If everyone has a degree, then what's it worth? Zero
"America is a third world country" ... well that went quickly... #debates #Debates2016
I love how literally everyone in the room laughs when Trump says his temperament is his best quality. #Debates2016
Wait, did he just say that? That's EXACTLY show he's sounded this entire election season. #Debates2016
Our next topic - Americas direction - Race. - Holy crap this is going to be an absolute shitshow now. Total mess at this point. #debatenight
#debatenight Donald, you know shit about IT!!  And people that use computers don't all weigh 400 pounds
Does he think that by simply saying "you're wrong," that makes it so? Is he aware that we keep track of this stuff?? #debatenight
We aren't a better nation. We are a deternation, says Trump. #Debates2016
If his best temperment is his temper... Shouldn't that say something? #debatenight #hesaiditnotme
Watching #Debates2016 is like watching a guy who is the best -as many people will tell you- at Wii Golf try to play a PGA course. #SAD
Chiiiiiiiile. I feel like I'm gonna havta leave the room when Trump starts talking about #race #debates
"hillary clinton has been trying to X for X years" - donald trump X times during #debatenight
You got bad debate prep advice, @realDonaldTrump. Dont sniff into the mic two hundred times in first half hour. #debatenight
Clinton should randomly drop in that Trump destroyed the USFL. No way he could resist going on a tangent defending that. #debatenight
"That was not a mistake, that was done purposely. When you have everyone take the fifth, it's disgraceful" ~@realDonaldTrump #debatenight
#crowd becoming restless. #clinton prepared to wait #trump our and deliver knockout late on. #trump going all in now. #debatenight
#crowd becoming restless. #clinton prepared to wait #trump out and deliver knockout late on. #trump going all in now. #debatenight
Trump is trying to bounce back after a couple of solid jabs from Hilary. #debatenight
RT: wbaltv11: Clinton: "We will defend the citizens of this country, and the Russians need to understand that." #debates #debates2016
Take a drink every time Trump takes a drink. *Insert really drunk joke here* #debatenight
The challenge is to heal the divide with police. But how? #debatenight  #debate2016 #covHERstories
#debates  Big fat ugly bubble. Now saying Fed more political than Hilly. Say what?
#debates  Trump claims he has been endorsed by govt agency ICE.
Hilary sounds so legit. BUT, you never if shes selling a dream or genuine. #debatenight
I wonder if he knows his 10 year old son's middle name or birthdate. #debatenight @realDonaldTrump
There ya go, Trump thinks it's smart not to pay his taxes. #debates
bruh I love my TL so much during these presidential debates
omg Trump just said "we need 2 take the guns away". probably the ONLY phrase that could actually hurt him #tytlive #debatenight #Debates2016
He keeps interjecting and it was honestly entertaining when he was destroying the Republican Party but now it's just obnoxious #debatenight
Does @realDonaldTrump not have any manners? Rule number 1 is take turns and number 2 is be respectful 🙄 #Debates
Have you changed who you are voting for because of this debate? #debatenight #ClintonVsTrump
#debatenight Lester lets them say whatever and they get off topic. They need a stronger moderator.
"Who was a very against police judge"  Wh... wha... English? #debates
i can't wait til trump's numbers with women come out tomorrow 📉 #debatenight
If anyone is watching this and still thinking about staying home on #electionday2016...You clearly are not paying attention. #debatenight
Donald just said he has common sense. Don't believe that. Can someone fact check it? #debatenight
"We have to knock the hell out of ISIS and we have to do it fast."- Donald Trump #Debates2016 #bestquote
Every American needs to listen carefully to what the candidates say at the #debates ...(slowly reaches for remote to turn on Family Guy)
@MSNBC Please tell me you got tape of @HardballChris or @maddow 's reaction to DJT "correcting" @LesterHoltNBC about stop/frisk  #debates
Hillary basically doesn't need to do much work. Just sit back and relax, girl. #debates
It's obvious she has lots of experience staying composed while white men yell over her. @HillaryClinton #debates
Donald said our airports are like that of a third world country. I just have to say @Delta Terminal at #SFO is very much so not #Debates2016
"The talk good around election time." Oh, like how you're trying to do now, @realDonaldTrump? #Debates2016
#Debates2016 Trump  stop lying about the birther movement. You are con and racist and could not stand a black person to being a Presidnet
HRC's debate prep looking strong through the first 30 minutes. That's *supposed* to be the ball game, but, you know, Trump. #debatenight
Donald does not have a very big vocabulary. He has to make fun of the New York Times. #debatenight
This is the only thing I'll agree with that Trump has said thus far, Bernie was cheated out of the nomination #Debates #BringBernieBack
Hillary Clinton is one badass woman and politician and advocate and leader. BADASS #debatenight
Hillary wants to run a country and keeps on talking about Trump's business. WTF!! #tcot #ccot #gop #polusa #debatenight
Ummm JFK is not like landing in a "third world country" 😒 relax yourself. #Debates2016
Stop and Frisk was deemed unconstitutional because it targeted Black and Brown folk. Racism. #Debates2016
I think Hillary's batteries and/or meds are running out. She's starting to slow down. #debates
Show this debate as the main reason why we need feminism. #Debates2016
When they go low Trump is able to go even lower #debatenight #sonotvotefoethisclown
"Mandatory minimums have put too many people in prison for far too long." — @HillaryClinton #Debates #Debates2016 #DebateNight #cato2016
Can the monerator just be president because he's not taking any of their crap #debatenight
I can't stop laughing at Trump's facial expressions oh my goodness he's so ridiculous #debatenight
' a big fat ugly bubble, a bit like that disgusting piece of shit Rosie O'Donnell' #debatenight
Trump discovers US was hacked by obese man on couch! An astute foreign policy advisor, his 10yr old son. #debates #debatenight
You know shit's about to get real when Russia comes into the conversation #debatenight
Did Trump just 'uh' a positive statement about the African American community? #debates #debatenight #Debates2016
To quote Trump: "a very against police judge". - Trump on the first #debatenight #Debates2016
Am I crazy or is the job of a moderator to actually moderate? You'd never know it by watching this. #debates #debatenight
TRICKLE DOWN ECONOMICS DOESN'T WORK IT DIDN'T IN THE 80S AND IT WON'T NOW #debatenight
"Donald started his career...by being sued for racial discrimination." -C. Imagine that. #debatenight
Trump is doing too much interruptions, do this mean something ? #Pressure #Debates
#debatenight oh my god it's like Deja vu ahmadinejad is coming to American in trumps shoes lol good luck #america u gonna suffer as we did
Donald Trumps 10 year old son weighs 400 lbs and hacked the cyber.  #Debates2016
Yes Donald STFU, it's Hillary's turn to speak. Go sit in the corner while the adult talk.#DebateNight
#debatenight Go to #crookedhillary website for fact checking She hasn't heard we don't trust her #liarliarpantsuitonfire @DiamondandSilk
Im confused... is Hillary blaming the police right now?!?!  Shut up Hillary #debatenight #Debates2016
Who hears the *dun dun* noise every time Trump says Law and Order? 😂😂 #Debates2016
HRC can't help but laugh at the nonsense Trump is spewing. Then flat out says he persisted RACIST lie. #debatenight #Debates2016
No one calls Sean Hannity. That sounds awesome, to be honest. #debatenight #Debates2016
"We need law and order in our inner cities." Anywhere else Donald? This dog whistle is remarkable #BLM #debates
The more I watch this debate, the more I just continue to shake my head about the uncertain future of our country. #debatenight
basically they're both trying to seem like the least racist, amazing #debatenight
"I'm an idiot so I'll just bash Hillary emails" yawwwwwwn.  What a pathetic human being just like @YoungCons   #debatenight
When @realDonaldTrump interrupts Lester Holt, why is the response "Please?" Would he say the same to @HillaryClinton. #debatenight
can he stop interrupting everyone like bro you're get your head out of your ass and maybe listen #debatenight
#debatenight After 30 years, Hillary decides it's time to invest in the middle class. Just elect her first.
@realDonaldTrump please please please do NOT vote for this IDIOT! Listening to does soup right now 😢  #stupidDonald #debatenight
I wouldn't vote for either one of these people for class president. This is just awful. #DebateNight #Debates #Debates2016
That was more than a mistake- it was done purposely.  When you have your staff take the 5th. #Debates2016
When they took our sailors prisoner, BHO/HRC PAID off the captors #Debates2016
I'm pretty sure Trump just blamed immigrants with guns for the violence in inner cities. And Stop &amp; Frisk will solve that. #debatenight
Dodging the question, typical "im wrong but im not gonna say it" bs #Debates
Does Donald Trump have property in Ferguson too? That seems to be his primary concern #debatenight
This is painfully embarrassing. How does anyone vote for Trump after this? #debatenight
Look at Trump lying and avoiding the question. He's really good at bsing #debatenight #debates #Debates2016
And he's not lying she had no problem with stop &amp; frisk while Senator #debatenight #debates #Debates2016
Me on Twitter scrolling through #debatenight tweets Daughter on Snapchat watching debate snaps  Yes, the kids are all in 🙌🏼
I love it when Donald gives small laughter pauses are received by silence #debatenight #debates #Debates2016
Ok they just agreed that one murder is too many. That is where we are right now #debates
"I think implicit bias is a problem with everyone, not just police." That's a very strong and very true statement. #debatenight
Is he claiming that Hillary has doctored old media records? what is this conspiracy theory bullshit? #debatenight
Believe me, I probably won't get credit for it, but libraries only started putting books in the buildings after I suggested it #debates
My God, Trump is more unhinged tonight than even I expected. #debatenight
STOP AND FRISK IS A VIOLATION OF BASIC HUMAN RIGHTS IT IS RACIAL PROFILING PERIOD #debatenight #debatenight
Dear people this man is nothing but doom &amp; gloom. He has no plans, no policies. He is nothing. #debatenight
Anyone else think Trump spreading those rumors about Hildawg's health is ironic given his case of the sniffles right now? #debatenight
Lester Holt: "Stop and frisk was declared unconstitutional" I love you, sir.  #Debates2016
I wish they would stop with the clap backs and answer the snag questions 😭🙄🙄🙄 #debatenight
Talking about saving America and that's there's a plan.. BUT WHATS THE PLAN?! #Debates2016
Sorry, he looks and sounds stupid... should never be near the White House #Cheeto #Trump #debatenight
Just to be clear Trump never won any of his debates. Carson dropped out of his and so forth on.
Some very bad things - yes, his first true words.  #Debates2016
Tremendous, truly a tremendous word. It's the best word. Tremendous. Good money, tremendous money. Tremendous. #debatenight
Yeah right! #Trump you are a cheat and a liar. How many businesses that you went #bankruptcy   #Debates
My mental capacity can't take much more of this #debates! #Trump is #petty! His condescending chastising is too much #Debates2016
Why aren't they addressing the questions the mediator is giving. Like for real  #debates
No Trump we don't need law and order that's the problem 🙄🙄🙄#debatenight #debate2016
Trump. Apparently the dnc hackers weighed 400 pounds and just sit in bed #debatenight
Extremely loud uproar of cheers at Revolution Hall when @HillaryClinton said, "I prepared to be president." #Debates2016 #LiveOnK2
The demons treatment of Lester and Hillary tonight is appalling, not surprising, but so much worse than i thought it'd be #debatenight
Second chance programs? Who gets a second chance? Ok I'm gonna go murder someone. Do I get second chance to fix my mistake? #Debates2016
There's no point in watching this debate. If Hillary literally died on stage, she'd still have my vote. #debatenight
The best part of this #debatenight is finding out how ridiculous you can make the candidates look &amp; sound with the use of snapchat filters.
actually, as a hispanic im not living in hell! we don't need a fascist who WOULD bring hate crimes to our communities #Debates2016
Wait, did Hillary just say Donald has something to hide? How about those 30+ thousand emails? What are you hiding? 🤔 #debatenight
Politicians talk a good game, but don't really do anything worth a hoot. Can we get a human who's lived in the real world? Trump #debates
I promise I will do everything in my power to make sure @realDonaldTrump will never, ever, ever step foot in the @WhiteHouse. #debatenight
Cancel this years election. I can't seriously vote for either one of them. #DebateNight
"let's not alienate Muslims, let's not push them away" @HillaryClinton being a real human being #syrrelpol #debates
So this is what it would look like if the @Browns and @Sixers played a common sport and went head to head #Debates2016
"I've been audited for almost 15 years" This is something to brag about? #debatenight #Debates2016 #ImWithHer
His 10 year old is good with computers? Pimping DC Hotels, Giuliani, Palm Beach Hotels, and 10 yr old computer whizzes! #debatenight
How many times are we going to hear Trump say "I did a great job." "I think I did good." "I did really good."? #debatenight
"NATO must focus on Tara" - Trump  Who the hell is Tara? Wait is she doing all the cybering? #debates #debatenight
Trump coming unhinged over Iraq war support.. Of all the hills to die on. #Debates2016
Trump and Hannity used to have karate fights over the Iraq war. #Debates2016
Since no questions on abortion: Hillary Supports Unlimited Abortions Up to Birth, No Limits Even in the 9th Month #debates #debatenight
The high ground is overrated... I really hope Hilary ends this debate with a testicle punch #debatenight
What topic are they even discussing this is so scatterbrains 💀💀💀 #debatenight
Aw Trump misses Benson and Stabler! He's right, Law and Order hasn't been the same since. #Debates #debatenight
Can we at least all agree that you gotta be nuts to want this job...#Debates2016
Why is President Obama's birth certificate a topic? He was born in Hawaii. Everyone knows this. End of discussion. 🙄 Move on. #DebateNight
If he brings Chicago up one more time for cheap shock value imma lose it Our problem is beyond anything he can even comprehend #debatenight
Here we go on Race, lets see what racist comments Trump will say #debates
Who wants to place bets that LT is watching the debates with a glass of wine in hand cursing at Hillary Clinton
#debatenight Gun epidemic not thuggery is problem wow play that victim card blame guns not people
I'm so glad Trump knows all his countries and not just like two or three tops!!!!! #debatenight
Trump on supporting the war on Iraq: "that was a mainstream media nonsense set up by her" #debatenight #Debates2016
Let be honest... both of these candidates really don't have the answers 😑 #debatenight
"We have to restore trust between communities and the police." Hillary Clinton #Debates
"Under President Obama, we've lost control of things we used to have control over." —Donald Trump #Debates2016
I hate both of these candidates. I want a do over....on everything.  #debatenight
Trump answering a question about what colour Hilary's shirt is; "I think my hair is great" #debatenight #icantansweranyquestions #runaround
Both Trump and Hilary are shady in their own way really #EH204 #debatenight
Trump says African Americans are living in hell when it comes to violence in America. Using Chicago as an example.#debatenight
Fact checker, fact checker, I need my fact checker because I'm a cunty cuntface who was born needing help. #debatenight
"So I have called for criminal justice reform. We have to recognize there are so many brave police officers." @HillaryClinton #debatenight
I would amend a precious tweet to: Trump starts every answer with either: a compliment to himself or a Clinton failure #debatenight
Apparently Hilary is the reason my ass is so itchy. She is the reason everything is bad in the world. #ThingsTrumpsays #debatenight
In Orlando #Frontline Outreach is within inner city. Guess who was there &amp; guess who went to NO inner cities in FL #Debates2016 #debates
Trump said stop and frisk is not illegal. He said it's not racial profiling for African american and hispanics. #debatenight
Donald started his career in 1973 and was sued for racial discrimination. Is this true? #birth certificate #debatenight
this would be funny if we were on SNL...but this is real life and I'm sad🙁 #debatenight
Holt: How do we fix the racial divide? Trump: Racial profiling. #debatenight
"Maybe because you haven't paid any federal income tax for a lot of years" #GoHillary #DebateNight
Did #DonaldTrump just state (twice) that because other developers were racist it wasn't so bad that I was racist too? #debatenight
Hillary just insulted Trump's boo Putin and Trump is ready to scratch her eyes out like an angry ride-or-die ho should. #debatenight
Ya know I just don't see Jeb, Cruz, Kasich destroying #HillaryClinton the way @realDonaldTrump is right now #RightManRightTime #debatenight
What the hell is the rich angry man shouting about now? Aw who cares it's probably straight talk. Believe me. #debates
*Donald on the birther issue and Obama's birthplace* I'm just learning this now. #debatenight
Trump: Internet... Is... Bad... We have to get better at... Computers.... Cyber...stuff  #debates
Blowing a ship out of water wouldn't start a war? What is wrong with Trump? #debatenight
I just figured Trump out.  He has a disease where if he goes more than 3 sentences without bragging he dies. #debates
"It's all words. It's all sound bites." "I take advantage of the laws of the nation." Trump's really said that. #DebateNight
You can't dismiss something like constitutionality as a presidential candidate. He didn't respond. #debatenight
Hillary is the nerd who studies &amp; knows her stuff, Trump is the schoolyard bully who's upset no one will let him copy off them #Debates2016
Trump: Stop and Frisk! Take guns away! Trump a few weeks ago: HRC wants to abolish the 2nd amendment! #Debates
Clinton looking straight down the barrel of the camera is like Tim on The Office when Brent said something idiotic. #Debates2016
Bring back Law &amp; Order?? It's on like 24/7 #Debates2016 😛 he's not mentioning race relations #fail
Can someone turn OFF his mic when is not his turn? #geez  #debatenight
Nope.  RT @mcottle: Has Trump made any point this evening beyond: Everythign we're doing is shit? #debatenight
Are we sure that @realDonaldTrump isn’t just running to hand @HillaryClinton the presidency? #debatenight
Record heat and debates - what a fine night to gig. No, seriously, you’ll get all the good details on facebook and twitter. Let’s play!
The fact checkers are gonna go ham off the bullshit Trump is saying #Debates2016
Who got "stiffed" more: Donald Trump's contractors or Bill Clinton's interns? #debates #debate #debatenight #Debates2016
Did Trump just say that Obama's birth certificate came from Kenya...?! #whatthefuck #Debates
Waiting to see his word count versus her.....we should count the finger points too #debatenight #Debates2016
Barack had to produce a birth certificate and Hillary has to debate an actual crazy person. This country has a long way to go. #Debates2016
If you look into Hillary's eyes, you can tell she's remembering the day Charlotte was born and trying to summon her Patronus. #Debates2016
@realDonaldTrump just implied that United Arab Emirates &amp; China are Third World countries #debatenight #Debates2016 #AmericaVotes
It's not in a braggadocios way.   Whew!  Glad he cleared that up. #debates
Why does Trump want everyone to release something? Why don't you release your toupee? #debates 💅🏼
I gotta make sure I have booze and a drinking game for the next debate 🙄🍻 #debatenight
So if everyone dislikes both of them, why did we get rid of Bernie and Cruz? #debates
My neighbors are wondering what all the yelling is over here #debatenight
Trump is kind of right on retention of forces. He is utterly idiotic on take the oil. Most stupid thing he has said tonight #DebateNight
What I wouldn't give to hear what Obama is shouting at his screen. #debatenight
Trump is bullying Hillary with interruptions, which should play against him, except her handling of it isn't great either. #debatenight
"I have the feeling that by the end of tonight I'll be blamed for everything that ever happened." "Why not?" #debatenight
And now Trump's gotten 100 million people to watch a live infomercial for his new DC hotel #Debatenight #Debates
#Trump doing an advertisement for his newest hotel during the Debate....never miss a good opportunity to pimp gang! #debatenight
#Hillary just tagged #Trump hard with her knowledge of why we had to pull out of #Iraq with a date set by #Bush.  #Presidential #debatenight
Once again Donald Trump is still under a routine audit #bullshit  #Debates @realDonaldTrump
He's her President. Noted. He doesn't want to be president of all of us, just chosen few. @realDonaldTrump #PresidentialDebate #Debates2016
When someone asks me to hang out: "I don't know..maybe..who knows..essentially." #debates
Yay.... Hillary Clinton gave news channels a sound bite with a sarcastic zinger a Fuller House writer could've come up with #debatenight
#Debates2016 @realDonaldTrump saying I didn't admit guilt is like a kid standing near a emptied cookie jar with crumbs all over him.
#Debates2016 Cybersecurity- @realDonaldTrump invited Russia to hack us - @HillaryClinton made a mistake, Trump commits treason #ImWithHer
Oh my God. How can anyone in their right mind want this man-child to run this country? #debatenight
Trump just rolled his eyes at Clinton because she got a good dig in. #debates
Trump has his lies on the Iraq War down. He did support it. #debatenight #debates
"You don't learn that much from attack returns"- Donald Trump  Well we will learn if you've been paying tax or not #Debates2016 #debatenight
@realDonaldTrump is not saying anything we have not heard. I cannot imagine two more debates with him in them. Boring. #debates
Trump seems significantly more prepared than I expected him to be, still rambles too much though #DebateNight
I honestly don't know if my eyes can roll any further back into my head.. #DebateNight
Trump talking about NATO not paying their fair share and not honoring contracts/agreements is so beyond ironic.. #DebateNight
#Debates2016 "We have to knock the hell out of ISI". Please ask him to be "Specific" now.
“Maybe he’s not as rich as he says he is”  BOOM  #debatenight
Watching this reminds me why I'm thankful for being in Canada and for @JustinTrudeau #Debates
Trump is spewing the phrase "Law and Order" when it comes to race relations. Is this 1940s Germany? #debatenight #NeverTrump
LAW AND ORDER WE NEED LAW AND ORDER yes that show was necessary #debates
You got audited because you find every tax loophole in the books. #debates
Holt: How do we tackle the racial divide  Trump/Hillary: Let's talk about guns and more guns.  #debatenight
The moderator has already been consumed into the void of this shit debate #Debates2016
Comparing finances to emails. SMH. Actually we don't need them to know that Trump went bankrupt MULTIPLE times. #debatenight
HC: He never paid income tax.  DT: That makes me smart.  When your presidential candidate rips off your own country.  #debatenight
#Debates2016 #debate politicians should dress like #NASCAR drivers. Then we all know who puts up the money behind them.
H: "and it showed he hasn't paid any federal taxes"                  T: "that makes me smart" #debatenight
"Yell a little more nobody can hear you." - @Clever_Otter just uttered at trump. #debatenight
#DEBATES2016 Trump WHAT a LIAR ! Even we have seems clips where he supports Iraq war. TV DO NOT LIE.
So is he saying that you need to take away guns... #debatenight
Trump sounds like he's getting all his info from Fox News. Oh wait. #DebateNight
So glad @realDonaldTrump "released a financial statement, of sorts." Looking forward to a "federal budget, of sorts." #Debates2016
Clinton uses the word "crazy" to describe what Trump is saying. Trump: "THERE'S NOTHING CRAZY ABOUT..." #Debates2016
#debatenight @HillaryClinton is running circles around @realDonaldTrump! Trumped up trickle down does not work period.
Trump just went from talking about Obama's birth certificate to the border.. #Debates2016
At this point, Lester Holt could be replaced by a chat bot #debatenight
"We need to move on"  TRump: YH BUT IM NOT DONE  #debatenight
A presidential candidate who uses the words "things" n "stuff" so frequently must really know his stuff #trump #debatenight  #debate2016
While Hillary speaks #trump is still trying to figure out how to bring back the #usfl #debatenight #Debates2016
always so proud of himself, no matter how insignificant or wrong. We all need that kind of confidence  #debatenight
Law &amp; order is important, but doesn't allow for the police to kill unarmed citizens. #debates #ImWithHer
Ok you're below budget on the post office. But didja pay the drapery installers? Huh Don? #debatenight
I want a debate, not this incredible slather of cinnamon-toasted narcissism #debatenight
#debates Trump is right because the DNC rigged it for Hillary , however Trump you know you didn't  want to debate him
#Debates2016 #TeamTrump here as #HillaryClinton is very good at deflecting but her joker face makes me itchy.
Even if Trump's claims re Hillary staff &amp; Obama is true SHE DIDNT SPEND FIVE YEARS PUBLICLY QUESTIONING OBAMA'S CITIZENSHIP. #debatenight
He's not saying, let's not be proud. He's saying that they are affected by violence a lot.  #Debates
trump is super into theft, as long as it's legal. it's why he has "billions of dollars" #debatenight
#debates Trump's just making a bigger fool out of himself. He should just deport his own ass back to hell...
Hilary wants to flip him off but she just used the pointer finger #Debates2016
I'm 99.99% sure that if Trump was a guy you worked with or was a neighbor, you'd absolutey hate him.#debatenight
If there's one thing he could do it's teach a PR class on buzzwords. #debatenight
Lord Jesus, if Hilary doesn't say something about the Central Park Five... #debatenight
So trump really trying to say #bluelivesmatter and that's all. K. No. In hell. Shot by the police. #debatenight
Is he bragging about his income from the shell games he plays? #debates
Every time @realDonaldTrump opens his mouth, braggadocious bullshit flies out of his mouth.   #debates
I didn't realize opposing nuclear proliferation was considered a bad thing. #debates
Hey @realDonaldTrump yelling "WRONG" when you don't agree when someone tells you about urself doesn't make you look better #Debates2016
Can we maybe debate things that matter? Anything else would be fine. #debatenight
Gangs of illegal immigrants roaming your streets RIGHT NOW, shooting your children and sleeping with your wives. #Debates2016
What. is. he. even. saying. Like words are just falling out of his mouth. In no particular order. #Debates
Fuck  Donald Trump, he doesn't care about the super predator comment.  Neither does Killary though.  #debatenight
PEcom_news: RT NewsJohnny: Clinton says Trump has a long record of engaging in racist behavior and says the birther lie hurt Obama. #debates
First time watching an American debate and trump is already making me face palm #Debates2016
If he takes advantage of the laws for his own benefit does that mean he will take advantage of the American people? #debatenight
#Trump is inhaling and sniffing like he might have a coke problem. Just saying'. #debatenight
Donald how you not gonna let my homie Rico live in your apartment complex g?! #debatenight
We lose on everything! @realDonaldTrump just called us a country of losers! #Debates2016
was the lawyer today an illegal immigrant? @realDonaldTrump claims they are the only ones who are shooting... #Debates #gunviolence
Trump is admitting to settling a lawsuit "with no admission of guilt." What a great skill. LOL #debatenight #debates #Debates2016
Why don't you talk about what you're going to do for America more than you bash each other #debatenight
But wait! Donald proud to say that he has endorsements from nearly every police org?! Da fuq? #debatenight
Also is it me or did Trump look a lot less orange😂 #Debatenight
He is NOT Presidential at all. Look how loud and obnoxious he is. #ImWithHer  #Debates
Who's this guy moderating the debate? Can he be president? He's the most grown-up person in the room. #debatenight
I love her but it sounds like a wet vagina when she talks...😂 #Debates
Trump: Lester, I'm really happy for you. I'll let you finish, but I'm gonna avoid directly answering this question right now. #debatenight
Wait.... Is Donald Trump saying we solve racism by saying that "those people are in gangs and have guns" #whatthefuck #debatenight
I look forward to the Internet coughing up an all-sniffles video version of this debate. #DebateNight
If Trump keeps digging his hole any deeper, he's gunna end up on the other side of his wall in a world not so kind to him #Debates2016
"We can't just say law and order" last I remember that was your last answer to the question #debatenight
Like isn't this basically the Bartlett v. James Brolin debate we never got to fully see. #westwing #Debates2016
Hillary's face rn: the face every girl makes when the annoying fuckboy won't leave you alone at the bar I swear #debatenight
How long will it be until "bodacious" starts to turn fade out of style? #debatenight
Now I am just imagining Trump doing a shake down all 1930s Gangster style #debatenight
to be or not to be NATO? With Putin on Europe s doorstep?it is even a question #releaseit#Debates
If trump was on millionaire, then I hope to God his phone a friend is Sean Hannity #debatenight
So this debate is causing me actual physical pain, so I'm bowing out now.  Wake me up on November 9th. #debatenight #ImWithHer
I understand why so many are drinking now; I feel drunk just listening to him go in circles. Random, lie, random, lie...drink! #Debates
Let's get a grassroots Write-In campaign going. Surely we can think of a couple million better options. #debatenight
i was for the was before i was against the war...which is it Mr. T? #Debates
Trump doesn't understand why he can't just shout and get his way......new foreign policy?  That'll go well.... #Debates
"He hasn't paid taxes" says she  "That makes me smart", says Don.  Seriously?  #ShameOnYou #debatenight
Hey @realDonaldTrump when you say your biggest strength is temperament and the audience laughs, you need to evaluate the list. #Debates2016
@thebl0w A smart person I know who is left of Clinton thinks T is winning (I am seeing missteps) #debates
Meanwhile the #Jays are fighting for their lives!!! #debatenight things r tooreal now (ball game on radio #debates live stream on computer)
Trump is the only guy that has blurry hair in high definition #debates
I could give a RATS ASS about Hillary Clintons TAXES or Donald Trumps TAXES! I guess taxes help with war #debatenight #debates #Debates2016
It isn't much of a debate when one candidate is allowed to talk over and disrupt the other without being reined in. #debate #debatenight
It's time for Hillary to go after him. The gloves need to come off. #debatenight #debates #Debates2016
Here we go again. Deflect Mr. Trump since you have no plan. The question is about home grown terrorism not oil. #debatenight
#debatenight trump too his sensitive to his business and not talking ideas of freedom
#debatenight does he not know history and the AskAmy by Jimmy Carter by mentioning 10year old son
I think @realDonaldTrump is sick, i mean besides the normal I think he has a head cold breathing is so heavy #debatenight
#debatenight Trump is just such a pig. I can't even fathom this nonsense.
"... You know what else I prepared for? To be Presideent!" - @HillaryClinton   YAAASS!!! COME THRUUU MADAM PRESIDENT!! 👏👏👊🔥💅 #debatenight
Donald, you are on audio tape saying you were in favor of the war in Iraq. #debatenight
I can't stand her voice -time to hit the mute button #Debates2016
How do you get the job of holding the stick up Trump's ass?  He seems to enjoy it. #Debates2016 #DebateNight #debate #debates
I think Trump just doesn't want us to know that he deducts hair and makeup. #debatenight
Donald Trump is getting ready to blow! Trump wants Holt to fact check Clinton!   #debatenight
Lester, how does the birther issue have one FREAKING IOTA of a tie to racial healing issue. #Debates2016
"I'm talking about taking guns away from gangs and PEOPLE THAT USE THEM." Trump wants to take our fucking guns! #Debates2016
Donald got property in chi town ya'll but he said it's terrible😂 #debatenight
#DebateNight @HillaryClinton you were home one week &amp; @tweeted @SteveHarveyHQ &amp; You Were Wrong..plz do not throw Stones/ Glass Houses?
It tells you something when @realDonaldTrump keeps falling back on his endorsements #Debates
Dear world, We'd never really let anyone so preposterous get so close to the Oval Office. This is the best "Just Kidding" ever. #debatenight
If you don't think that Hillary Clinton contributed to the growth of ISIS, you need to stop kidding yourself. #Debates2016
There is only one President on this stage and she is doing great #debatenight #debates #Debates2016
Hillary has already proven unworthy to be the leader of the free nation. She's a liar and deceitful #Debates
Talk about race relations: talk over the African-American moderator. To quote Santana ft. Rob Thomas, "Smooth." #Debates2016
haven't given a lot of thought to NATO? and you're a presidential candidate #DebateNight
"Outside of the hands that do harm." Then defund the police and redirect funds. They're the ones shooting. #debatenight
#CrookedHillary I'm going to be blamed for everything! Why not?  Well you are the institution Hill #debatenight
Watching #debatenight makes me thankful my country doesn't have to deal with this circus show 😂
Sorry to disagree with Clinton, but why does USA get to have nukes but no one else? Nobody should imho #Debates
Trump you're supposed to be debating Clinton,  not Lester Holt #debatenight
Race isn't a challenge. Racism is BAD. Cops can make idiot moves and citizens are expected to remain calm. #idiotlogic #debatenight
Trump doesn't even pay taxes or his contractors but he want to sanction NATO members??? He is out of his mind?  #Debates #Debates2016
"We have to address the systemic racism in our system" #debates #Debates2016  #debatenight
He just said he has good temperament and then interrupts Lester Holt. #debatenight
Trump: no wonder you've been fighting ISIS your entire adult life.  Must be nice to make up history on the fly like that. #debatenight
He's frantic and frenetic isn't he. he's even getting owner by the MODERATOR. #DonaldTrump #HillaryClinton #ImWithHer #debatenight
If I was a moderator I'd say "Listen up candidkids I've had more Advil than probably allowed shhhhhh next topic" #debatenight
This is the scariest thing I will watch all Halloween season #debatenight
"It would be squandered too..." So he just admitted he hasn't paid??? #debates
I keep my lists of banks next to my binders full of women #Debates2016
Hey remember binders full of women? That was a thing, right? Lol. Those were good times. #Debates
We need a president who will bring diplomacy and prevent wars. Not one that will start wars based off personal provocation . #debatenight
Hillary concerned about hacking. She better be. Just wait til some of those 30k emails show up from elsewhere. Like Russia. #debatenight
"They talk good" - Donald Trump. Too bad you don't, sir. #debatenight
Trump's got a 10 year old son who's awesome at the internet. #debatenight
"It also could be someone sitting on there bed that weighs 400 pounds." (Hacker description?) hmm. #MrRobot  #debatenight
Isn't China stealing American jobs? Now Trump wants China to protect America?#debatenight
i don't even know why i'm watching anymore. hillary won the moment she walked out in that red pant suit. damn i'm in awe #debatenight
Ding ding ding! Punches thrown! Website and books plugged! 3000 illegal immigrants just got pneumonia #debatenight
Trump supporting Dem gun policies, brings up Clinton's super predator comments out of the blue #debates
I am fully behind Secretary Clinton regarding nuclear weapons and having the temperament to not give in to anger. #debatenight
Neither candidate has addressed congress passing a balanced budget, or reducing the 17 trillion dollar elephant in the room. #debatenight
We're still waiting to see proof that Trump wasn't born in hell. #debates
If Hillary knew Obama was bothered by the "birther" stuff, WHY did she bring it up?!?!? #debatenight
"Maybe he's not as rich as he says he is" #debatenight 🔥🔥🔥🔥
TRUMP IS KICKING BOTH THEIR ASSES !!! #TRUMP2016 #Debates2016 #debates HE WAS AGAINST THE WAR. PERIOD.
donald thinks he's very smart for avoiding tax- but NATO aren't scoundrels for not paying their dues. ffs #drumpf #debates
History was made when Clinton called out Trump on birtherism using the term “racist lie”. That was beautiful. #debatenight
no fly, no buy is bad policy @HillaryClinton. recent terrorists were on FBI watch list. do better. #debatenight
Wasn't that Darth Cheney's thing? Taking the oil? So why didn't he do it? #TYTLive #Debates2016 @cenkuygur @WesClarkjr @jimmy_dore
#Debates2016 Take advantage of the laws of the nation and take advantage of the little guy
Trump you're a literal child oh my god what's happening please stop talking  #debates
So... cyber hacking is ok right now because we learned something from it? #DebateNight
Trump's incompetence has manifested in is verbal utterances of incoherence. Please try again never.#debatenight #Debates2016
I think the Donald just confused @POTUS Barrack Obama with Tiger Woods. #debatenight
TURN OFF HIS MIC WHEN HE WON'T STOP WHEN TOLD WE HAVE TO MOVE ON.  #Debates2016
"I'm not saying this to be braggadocious." Continues to brag about his wealth and company. #debatenight
Now @realDonaldTrump is advocating re-invading the ME while saying it was a bad idea in the first place #debatenight
Not paying income taxes "makes me smart" @realDonaldTrump says. Brags about flaws in our system that favor the rich. Stupid. #debatenight
"I opened a club." @realDonaldTrump version of "Some of my best friends are black." #debatenight
This Spawn of Azathoth really did not fall far from that eldrtich tree, did it? #debatenight
We didn't ask for a list of banks, we asked for your tax returns @realDonaldTrump #debatenight #PresidentialDebate
I just realized they wanna do two more of these things. Oh mercy. #Debates2016
Trump sneaks in that he made $694 million last year. That's what he's most proud of- not running for President. #debates #Debates2016
Hillary trying to take away people's guns, but she is a murderer herself so confused. #debatenight
Perhaps if you paid your tax Donald your country wouldn't be in such a mess! #Debates2016
Trump: "I know how to win, she does not" DAMN I CANT WAIT TILL HILLARY WINS THE PRESIDENCY OF THE UNITED STATES!! #debatenight #ImWithHer
Hillary pointed out Trump didn't pay any federal taxes and Trump retorts "That makes me smart" Wha?! #debates
People you really want him? Even if you dont like her.. Please not him! #debatenight #NeverTrump
Time for Trump to take the gloves off, with these insinuations spewing out of Hillary's mouth. #debatenight
Frankly, I am feeling like I've been ripped off. This debate is like a big movie production,with a plot that goes nowhere. #debatenight
#debatenight #runicscribbles Here I tried to sleep (4am) but everybody just keeps twittering that I needed to see the drama for sad myself
Donald trumps guide to presidential debates: anytime you hear something you don't like, just say wrong until they stop talking
#debatenight. If you run the light at a club you don't get booked again. You should get disqualified if you go too long during the debate.
Clinton has the patience of a saint. These comments from Trump are beyond bonkers. #debatenight
How many times will Donald Trump dodge this Tax return question? #debatenight
Hillary is killing it! So classy and he's just bubbling over… #DebateNight
Trump: "I have a better temperament than she does!"  Except all those times you threaten journalists with petty lawsuits. #debates
NEW DRINKING GAME  Drink every time Trump:  1) takes a sip of water 2) says "tremendous" 3) interrupts clinton 4) says "china"  #debatenight
trump keeps avoiding questions, lester asked about the attacks, but he started talking about obama and hillary's plan for ISIS #debatenight
trump is acting like a child here lol clinton is so professional, she prepared intensely i guess #debatenight
i have counted, he took a sip of water 9 times so far #debatenight
Gotta love the spontaneous cheering of audience when Trump asks for Clinton's missing 33000 emails. #debates
I've learned not to lend expectation to the art of igniting reality's true potential emphatically. Look out America. #debates
I'd like to see a candidate not always to refer to the US as a "great" country and admit its very flawed. #debatenight
Trump doesn't want to release his tax returns, anybody think he's hiding something? #hive55 #debatenight
The 400 pound person anecdote is the worst soundbite of the night. #debatenight
just realized the debate hashtag is a podium, not a martini glass #debatenight
There is something about the way he says "China" that is so terrible. #debatenight
"It's all words. It's all sound bites" Maybe Donald should look up the word "hypocrisy" #Debates2016 #ImWithHer #LoveTrumpsHate
He keeps plugging that he has "property" in places like NY, Chicago, and Charlotte as if that actually matters... #Debates2016
"That makes me smart," says @realDonaldTrump to the claim of not paying federal taxes. Wow! #debatenight
This man refuses to back down from a question or a talking point  #DebateNight
Apparently Trump has a calm temperament...Maybe someone needs to explain to him what that word means. #Debates2016 #TheDonald #braggadocious
#Debates Commentator needs to learn Law. "Stop and Frisk" still requires "Reasonable Suspicion".Nothing to do with Race. Stop Race Baiting
Clinton: I made a mistake using private email. Trump: That's for sure. #DebateNight.
TWO #debatenight TAKES: 1.) Hillary has that Selina Meyer always-smiling game on lock. 2.) Reagan was trash.  Ok thanks, 2K time.
Do I move to Canada or Mexico? That's the only debate I need in my life after seeing these 2 jokes talk during #debatenight
Next Topic: Race Relations...Maybe a topic that will be a serious conversation. #debatenight
Howard Stern + Sean Hannity + The Iraq War + i have much better judgement than Mrs. Clinton. #addorcoke #Debates2016 #trumpisms
Trump: I feel very strong about strong and I am very strong about stronger strong #debates
"It's really unfortunate that @realDonaldTrump paints such a dire and neg. pic of the black community" -@HillaryClinton #debatenight
Come with it Hillary. Shame the devil.   What about those "colored" apartment apps, Don Juan?  #Debates2016
Donald Trump bragadociously showed off the word he knows. The best words. #PresidentialDebate #debatenight #Debates2016
I have such a headache from #debatenight and we still have twenty minutes left
Trump: "I have a much better temperament."  Some dude is the crowd: "HA oh my god" #Debates2016
Two millionaires telling us how they are going to "fix" America. They don't care about the middle class, let's be real. #debatenight
If the hundreds of words I've heard Trump speak tonight, none of them have formed a meaningful or legitimate sentence #Debates2016
Bully the moderator...thats the way to go! Exactly what I'm looking for in the leader of the free world...a Bully. 🤔😒 #debates
And can we just finally put it to rest, Hillary's camp came up w/the Birther argument. It's always been dumb. #ThanksHillary #debatenight
Has anyone caught that @realDonaldTrump hasn't completed a full sentence. Just two instead run on sentences.#debatenight #debates
"Clearly we're facing two different kinds of adversaries."—HC 1. Independent hacking groups  2. Cyber attacks from states #Debates2016 via …
For her to say there is "something he is hiding" is kinda calling the kettle black.  #justsaying #Debates
You couldn't pay me to vote for either of these clowns. #debatenight
I wish they'd show the "reports" the candidates keep referencing to #debates
YESSS! He'll angry tweet the nuclear codes at 3 am 😂 #Debates2016
Now THIS is the stuff that's important to be talking about. #debatenight
American airports third world?  Pls. Have you traveled to third world? #debatenight
Can we we get a screen saver and just audio for this debate? I can't even watch this without grimacing. #debatenight
I can't even tell what he's saying...this is all just word salad...#debatenight
I just wish I could skip through Donald Trump talking about how proud of himself he is.  #Debates
Trump just doubled down on crazy re: the birther thing and Holt called him on it. #debates
Hillary should go to the South Side of Chicago to see if things are ok. #DebateNight
.@inquirerdotnet  Clinton: "He has a long record of engaging in racist behavior" #debatenight
"If you are too dangerous to fly, you are too dangerous to buy a gun" #debatenight
Trump has on a Blue tie. Hillary came dressed in Red. She means business. #debatenight
Stop and frisk was made unconstitutional in 2013... Nice one trump. #debatenight
"That makes me smart." Donald J. Trump on not paying taxes. #Debates2016 #debatenight
African American communities have been abused...restart stop and frisk.  Whaaa?? #debatenight
Omg what is he even saying? Ok Hillary won the debate. #Debates2016
@KatyTurNBC @MichelleFields Trump inasmuch admitted he doesn't pay Federal taxes. He said he was smart. #debates
These are the two best candidates this country has to offer? God help us. #debates #debatenight #WeAreScrewed
Trump will be scoring big with his alt-right fan boys with his constant sneering of the mainstream media though.  #debatenight
Ignorant. Trump probably blames Pres Obama and Hiliary for Hurricane Katrina too lmao #debatenight
Good come back Hiliary. It says something when you take the job serious enough to Prepare. #debatenight
I'm glad I watched @DancingABC before the debate. Got my snark gene in tip-top form. #PerryOnDancingStage #Debates2016
NATO is a military organization assembled to protect its members. Not an economic force, not an army to attack anyone. You moron! #debates
@realDonaldTrump sounds like the kid who forgets he has to do a presentation &amp; so he decides to wing it... very poorly.  #Debates
Lester Holt will be my hero of the night when this is over #debatenight
40 minutes in: He still hasn't given any real info, quoted actual infor, or let her answer a question. #debatenight #Debates2016  #Debates
How big of a jug would we need to "take all the oil" Donald.? #debatenight #bufgoon
Stop-and-frisk is absolutely a race neutral law applied racially. Black people definitely DO NOT support the policy. #debates
@realDonaldTrump says it makes him smart because he didn't pay income taxes. #Debates2016
donald trump is like a wall brainless hillary is like an email brainless #Debates
omfg it's like watching a 10 yo scream on a playground... #Debates
Why won't you release your emails, pretty sure they're more important than his tax returns since they get released anyhow #debatenight
Trump looks like a kid that threw his project together an hour before class just trying to hit the time limit minimum #debatenight #debates
I don't know how anyone could vote for Trump....especially if you actually research the things he has done. Unreal #debatenight
time for cup two of tea #debates  Jesus how do adults do this
It's happening... Hillary and Donald are now making out on stage... #debatenight
I have no love for either candidate, but Trump is beating himself. All Clinton has to do is let him rant. #Debates
@rob_simonson oh yeah I heard her mention a mistake. Fair enough. Thanks #Debates
Hope theres a lot of water (or clear liquid) behind #Trump podium He's clearly heated &amp; thirsty Gettin worked up!#VoteLoving #debatenight
A very against police judge.  THIS GUY COULD BE PRESIDENT  #Debates2016
Jesus for president cause He's the only one who can actually save us all am I right or am I right. #debatenight
Barack and Michelle at home right now, leaning n  get 'em, hill  #debatenight #debates #Debates2016  fist bump that, u racist birther...
does he realize by having 2 "always get the last word"  he's actually making it worse  #debatenight #debates #Debates2016
When you thought Peruvian debate was bad and then you see this lmao #debatenight
Trump's decided he's better off taking heat for not releasing tax returns until election day than taking heat for what's in them #Debates
@GOPBlackChick and in 1973, 42 years ago, believe Hillary was still a Republican #debatenight #debates
#debatenight Donald did you do a few lines before yo came out? #allthatsniffing
Trump sued for violating #FairHousing  laws just like infamous Donald Sterling was sued for violating Fair Housing #debates #apartments
Why is this even a competition? My dog is more qualified and stable to be president than @realDonaldTrump #debatenight
This is already descended into a shouting match and a debacle of Trump shouting over Clinton #debatenight
Anyone else think Hillary's eyelids are going to stay closed....she keeps wobbling, she is sleepy #debates
MUH FEELZ WHY AM I FEELING THIS WAY GET ME A HILLARY WOJACK #debatenight #debates
This question about Obama's birth place really affects my daily life and will certainly help me choose a candidate. #debatenight
Just because I'm going after Hildabeast, doesn't mean I'm for TantrumBoy. Let's just clear that up. 👍 #NeverTrumpOrHillary #Debates2016
What does the about of shooting have to do with Obama being in office? So its his fault? #DebateNight #Debates
Attacking 4chan values? "400 pound hackers on their bed" "getting tough on cyber" #debates
"Your president thinks..." - @realDonaldTrump ; excuse me Donald, are you no longer American?! He's "our" President. | AJK #debatenight
I'm really praying for our troops. Trump will have y'all occupying the moon by 2020. #debatenight
"I agree with her on nuclear armament being the biggest problem. Not global warming like you think" what the hell? #debatenight
If Trump wins then I will have been blocked by the President of the United States because I called him a "wad" on Twitter.  #debatenight
I think when he cant think of something to say he brings up the emails from years ago smh #Debates2016
He wasn't charged as guilty so that means he wasn't racist. Right? #debatenight
have email technical staff refuse to cooperate with congress, expecting citizens to cooporate with any authority #debates
Who else noticed that he refers to Secretary Clinton as "she" #debatenight
this nigga Trump just endorsed #StopandFrisk and called "illegal immigrants" gang bangers. this is a mf shit show #Debates2016
I stopped watching the debate 30 min ago but I can't stop laughing at twitter #itslit #debatenight
Hillary can tell you about 40 years of governing ideas, Trump can go on and on naming cities he has heard of.  #Debates
If you're a reporter who gives @realDonaldTrump high marks on this fact-free word vomit he's spewing tonight, shame on you! #Debates2016
Hilary: I take responsibility  Trump: Uh I prepared something that she just cut off at the knees. Uh My friends know stuff. #debatenight
"Well, just listen to what you heard" says Hillary about Donald's incoherent response on birtherism. Audience laughed. #debatenight
And now @realDonaldTrump is talking about himself in the third person. OMG. What is coming out of his mouth right now??? #Debates2016
#DonaldTrump we don't care if you got properties in #Charlotte or #Chicago. You care more about properties than people #DebateNight
'Cyber' = ... Rant...  '400 pound person sitting on their bed'... Rant...  'my 10 year old son is good w computers' ... Rant... #Debates2016
Donald and Hilary will have homework to do tonight. I miss doing homework. #Debates2016
That's it I'm writing in @Beyonce for president! She would have it all under control #QueenBee #debatenight
Donald Trump supported Hilary Clinton for President in 2008. That's a Snapple fact #DebateNight #TweetWithUs
Don't talk to TRUMP about Muslims... Everytime he speaks, Terror Alert in US goes to Orange. #debatenight #debatenight
"You were #SecretaryofState when (#ISIS) was a little infant," #Trump says to #Clinton. "Now it's all over the place." #Debates #debates2016
#debates  Trump has wandered totally into the weeds trying to explain how he was against Iraq. I have a winning temperament.
@realDonaldTrump doesn't care about healing America.  He said it on National TV people!  #debatenight
@jenniferweiner He said maybe a 400 pound guy in his bedroom hacked into the DNC.  #fatshaming #debatenight
HRC: Says DT is too negative. Says Black communities are vibrant and should be celebrated.  #DebateNight
Gotta say HRC's attacks against DT so far seem unlikely to grow her support base. #DebateNight
Really?!? Trump is boasting about getting Obama to produce his birth certificate? #DebateNight
Ah. We're now at email, though it has nothing to do with the question or topic. Knew it wouldn't take long!#debatenight
Nuclear weapon are frightening and horrifying and anyone who doesn't feel that way is not qualified to be dog-catcher. #debates #debatenight
Just because you have been on ten shows saying ten different things doesn't mean that you didn't say all the things. #debatenight
If cheering were allowed, this thing would go full cage match. There's never been a political debate like this. #debatenight #debates
ISIS hasn't even been in existence for that long you literally don't know what you're talking about @realDonaldTrump #debatenight
Take out ISIS for dinner and drinks?  Was just thinking Movie.  #Debates
Haha, holy shit, he really did just pull a Lois Griffin. #debatenight
Our NATO allies should pay us? I guess we're getting into racketeering now #debatenight
Clinton is like a patient CSR and Trump is the idiot customer just rambling on in incomplete sentences #debatenight
Hillary, we all know you're the real racist here. Go home your drunk. #debatenight
Thing about debates is both sides will claim to have won regardless of what you witnessed
"Quick my script has nothing in it about this, I know!" *Laughs* Poor Hillary #debatenight
'I settled that law suit with no admission of guilt, very easy to do' Erm, he's not really getting this is he... #debatenight
Take a shot every time an uneducated person tweets something irrelevant about the campaign #debatenight
Here's the deal! Even if @BarackObama was born overseas his mother was #American that alone makes one American automatically  #Debates
Trump word salad tonight is just a mess of lies and bluster. Still hasn't said what exactly his plans are.  #debatenight
Just cut their mics. We'll just do a staring contest. Would be more informative #Debates
The only candidate that has a sure fire plan to decrease taxes across the board? @GovGaryJohnson #debates
Why do I feel like Donald Trump did more research on Hilary's email's than he did on actually running our country? #debatenight
"I want to get on to other things"...but you distracted from important issues for how long? #debatenight
Trump- I been Audited for 15 Years Exactly TRUMP! Release Your Emails Hillary! #DebateNight  ♡#MAGA
The Only Thing she's doing other than trying to go to war with Russia is She is Going on Attack showing She's done Nothing  #DebateNight
Just an extra voice:  I couldn't give less of a fuck about Clinton's emails #debatenight
This is not about "love" @realDonaldTrump and also stop w/the self promotion. IT IS ABOUT TRUTH, FACTS, &amp; 0 delusions. CRAZY #debatenight
@realDonaldTrump is pounding @HillaryClinton...she's just trying to use catchy phrases!! She is doing TERRIBLE!! #Debates2016 #TrumpPence16
Literally crying at that last tweet. Earth to Lester 🌍🌍🌏 😂. Update: Mom is making T-shirts "🚫Trumped-up Trickle Down" #DebateNight
Trump: "It's terrible what's going on there. I know, I have property there" #debatenight
Clinton: "Cyber warfare is one of biggest challenges facing next pres... The most troubling has been from Russia." #Debates2016 #nbc12
"A very against police judge" this fool can't even speak in sentences #debates
We squander federal dollars on silly things like social security, VA hospitals, and the EPA. #debatenight #trumposaur
.@HillaryClinton is supposed to be defending taxing the rich but she's just attacking @realDonaldTrump's plan. Get on topic! #debates #TTT16
.@HillaryClinton thinks @realDonaldTrump let Russians hack the DNC? Did I hear this right?? #debatenight #debates #debates2016
Trump logic: doesn't know how to answer a question.   Trump: *changes the question* #debatenight
UCOL Enrichment Program class watching tomight's debate with instructor, former Ambassador Gary Grappo. Interesting start! #debatenight
Giving kids free college won't help if there are no jobs... #debatenight
"Gun safety measures" -@HillaryClinton  wow, trying very hard to avoid saying gun control. Or is that not what you are proposing? #debates
Implicit bias is a problem for everyone, not just police - HRC... #debatenight
Audience laughs when #Trump says he has better temperament than #HRC: "I have a winning temperament." #debatenight
We've become a third world country because our airports aren't as nice as Dubai and China??? You're real dumb Trump. #debatenight
"Could have been a 400 lb person on their bed" -Trump. Are you fucking kidding me? #debatenight
I'm sorry, I literally did not understand that line about getting to Pennsylvania Avenue. #Debates2016
Putting money on "Chicago" being Donald's secret code word to Putin. #Debates2016
Trumps kid may be good with computers, but my 400 pound friend is AMAZING with them. #debates
#Debates Woulda been better phrased something like "he liked the attention" not "his followers believed it" ... his agency! @HillaryClinton
Nobody cares where you've been Trump! You keep showing up on your own with no invitation. Go home! You're drunk #Debates2016
Jesus fuck, he's back on Stop &amp; Frisk.   UN  CON  STI  TUT  ION  AL  #Debates2016
'Lester, I think implicit bias is a problem for everyone, not just police.' #debates #trueclinton
Omg Trump nooooooo... Stop talking..... He didn't even answer the question. #Debates2016
❤️ when the NRA is used in the same  sentence as "good people" #debates
Stop &amp; frisk is literally racial profiling &amp; we all know it will disproportionally target blacks &amp; other minorities ...#DebateNight
Hillary still is still very questionable when it comes to these issues. Let us not forget she supported Bill's 1994 crime bill! #debatenight
Trump and Clinton both agree they don't care for Lester Holt's format and they'll let him know what theyll respond to. #debates
You are such a racist Neanderthal and I am getting even more physically sick from this debate #debatenight
Trump's input on Iraq was that we should have taken more of their natural resources #debatenight
I think I need to dream a little higher cause apparently ‘$650 million isn’t a lot of money’ #debatenight
They get so off the topic to the point where I don't even know what the question actually is #Debates2016
Apparently if I walk down the street I'll get shot.  #debates
#debatenight  Trump says we should have taken OIL out of Iraq which is against International Law
Okay, the thing abt T making Mar-A-Lago open is BULLSHIT. There were no FL laws that denied entry to non-whites. #debates
#debates Hillary has the face right now on 9/26/16.This hour of someone cringing when someone drags fingers across chalkboard.Speechless
#debatenight Were in major trouble with either of these jackasses running this country.
LOLLLL this chaos already. #debatenight And we still have over an hour of this? beautiful.
Stop and frisk WAS racial profiling! How are we STILL listening to this man!? #debatenight
"I'm not even complaining" - Donald Trump um excuse you you're always complaining #debatenight
"Implicit bias is a problem for everyone, not just police." Glad @HillaryClinton acknowledged this tonight. #debatenight
@actprogressive He got her on NAFTA/TPP- she is looking awkard. Now he is playing to the anti-establishment. #BringBernieBack #debatenight
Trump:The record shows I'm right                 Literally everyone else:Well actually....    Trump:THE RECORD SHOWS IM RIGHT #DebateNight
HRC takes responsibility for the emails. Trump takes no responsibility for his taxes, or stiffing his vendors #debates
#Debates Waiting for someone to bring up the fact that Native Americans are the most likely to be killed by a police officer. Just saying.
Give Lester a mixing board and let him cut the interrupter's mic. #debatenight
Trump winning debate with Lester Holt on issue of law and order. Let's get back to Clinton. #debatenight #Debates2016
"I haven't given a lot of thought to NATO." ~Donald Trump #debatenight #debates2016
Sean Hannity getting a whole lot of mentions in this debate. #Debates2016 #Debates2016
NOT YOUR TURN DONALD. Omg that is so annoying. Stop interrupting. That is 'DISGRACEFUL' #ToxicTrump #ImWithHer #Debates2016
How many times is he going to talk over people? Manners Donald. #ImWithHer #DebateNight #ToxicTrump
I don't know why I thought Trump wouldn't make an idiot of himself tonight but he's impressively bad #debatenight
"When I did an interview with Howard Stern,"--Trump. Is that the first time Stern has been willingly brought up by Pres candidate? #debates
Trump is doing a poor job of empathizing. Focusing on black on black rather then tension between police and communities. #DEBATES
Like this tweet if you to had to drink or get high to listen to #Debates2016 #debatenight #USPresidentialDebate
"Nuclear is the single greatest threat." Mmmmm, no. No, it's really not. Also, you might want to fix your words there. #Debates
Hillary's emails are about ready to all come back from Russia  #Debates
This may be very uncouth and un-political, but fuck Donald Trump for that entire word salad. #debatenight
Call back to Michelle Obama at the DNC. Better times, fam. Better times #debates
#debates: #TheDonald turned over his tax returns when state ordered it to get a casino license. Whoa!
Worst economy evee? Someone tell the unemployment rate  (5%) and the deficit (which has been cut in half), they missed the memo #Debates2016
What report was that, Trump? You have to cite your sources. #Debates2016
@BernieSanders God, I wish the DNC had chosen you. Then we'd have much better #debates and an actually GOOD candidate. #Bernie2020
Has trump been required to give an opening statement at all so far on any question? #debatenight
Hilary Clinton is killing it in that red not pant suit #DebateNight
The Old Post Office Building is the closest trump will get to the White House #debatenight #ImWithHer
Trump is in a debate, wants to call a friend (Hanity)! Will he ask for 50/50 next? #Debates2016
With all the dirt on Hillary, anyone that isn't a complete fucking idiot (Trump) should be able to put her on her heels. #fail #debatenight
#Donald you want #NATO to pay their fair share, but you won't pay taxes? WTF? #ReleaseTheReturns #CrookedDonald #debates
Oh, damn...the birther question now. Lester ain't playing like Matt Lauer. #Debates2016
"I dunno...I mean we coulda left like, uh, 10,000 troops behind?" I keep hearing him in Mr. Jack's voice! HA! @Jeremy_Rowley #debatenight
Moderator really not doing his job - get him back on topic.  #debatenight
Pool: Trump either a) has a coronary, b) implodes on stage, or c) lunges at @HillaryClinton. 50/30/20. #debates #debatenight
She's hammering on his taxes because there is NOTHING ELSE :-D #debatenight
Trump: we need law and order bc I have investments Charlotte #Debates2016
#Trump: "under Obama we have lost control of a lot." Does he means black people? #debatenight #Debates2016 #ImWithHer #HillaryClinton
Gsus. I cannot stand Hillary and her whole face. Her whole lying existence. Why couldnt we get a better opponent? Im weeping. #debatenight
HuffingtonPost: Clinton: "I think implicit bias is a problem for everyone, not just police." #debates
The only entity @LesterHoltNBC has called out tonight so far has been the audience for cheering. #debatenight
So, I'm just listening to the audio stream of this in the background, but is this going as badly for America as it sounds? #Debates2016
Youtube keeps buffering while I'm trying to watch the debate. Grrr! #debatenight #Debates2016
"Hillary Clinton's plan is to try to get Donald J. Trump to lose the debate by making him lose it."   Obvious.   #debatenight
Is Hillary doped up??? She is speaking so slowly. I guess you have to think about lies #debatenight
Why won't Trump release his taxes? Inquiring minds want to know    #debatenight
so he basically said minorities are bad people. yep. totally gonna be president now #Debates
@redsteeze and Hillary said she wants terrorists on the no-fly list right after she said profiling is unconstitutional. #Debates2016
There's something he's hiding? So why did you delete your emails? What are you hiding? #debatenight
"Well I hope the fact checkers are turning up their volume and working hard." -@HillaryClinton LOL #debatenight
➖ Trump and Hilary debating like they just ended a situationship , " ....I just want you to be happy " 🙄 #Debates2016
When since being wealthy was a crime? Oh I know, when you have more money than the average American. Step your game up. #debatenight
Middle-lower class African-Americans want handouts. Keep getting handouts and see your life won't get better. #debatenight #debate
There is no way Trump is going to last without having a heart attack! #debates #debatenight
ok when does Lester hand Trump and Hillary their mics so they can do their rap battle #debates
Donald Trump- "I've been endorsed by many white people who hate the blacks, believe me."  #debatenight #debates
TRUMP, Just doesn't want his money to be bothered! Thats why he is against taxes on the wealthy.  #debatenight #Debates2016
Watching this debate Trump never answers questions.He states his opinion and then gives facts about his life and businesses. #Debates2016
I have a question to trump about race since he chooses to speak, does he even know the names of innocent ppl killed by police? #debatenight
I have learned more about trump's investments &amp; where he has property than I've learned about his plans for the US #typical #Debates2016
"I HAVE A WAY BETTER TEMPERAMENT!!!"  Um, you're yelling in all caps... kinda refutes your argument #debatenight
Trump: I have a better temperament Audience: *laughs* Me: Rolls eyes  #debatenight
do trumps teeth look so white bc they contrast with his fake tan? #debatenight
We've moved to the section of #debatenight where both parties try to argue about who's been less hurtful to @POTUS
Latest Summary:   'The Middle East is a total mess.'  'African American Communities are a mess.'  'America is a mess.'  #debatenight
Waiting for "Executive Producer Dick Wolf" to appear on the screen #LawandOrder #debatenight
Trump: "The African-American community has been let down by our politicians." #debatenight
Trump said stop-and-frisk wasn’t ruled unconstitutional. FALSE. It was, by a federal judge in 2013 via @CNN #debatenight
How many times will @realDonaldTrump mention China tonight? Let's start a count #debatenight #Debates2016
"Force only when necessary" that is something that needs to be a HUGE focus right now #trainpolice #debatenight #Debates2016
Here's an idea, shut off the mic when it's not his turn FFS #debatenight #toddlerlife #ToddlerTrump
Email disclosure plans create cheers. Trump. Great Q by Lester re: negotiable #debatenight
Trump just made a dig at playing golf. His son just opened a new golf course. What? #debatenight
Reminder: When Trump talks to minorities, he isn't trying to get their votes. He's trying to get white fragility votes. #debatenight
Well this is a disaster, let's try this again in 4 years. #debatenight
“I haven’t given much thought to NATO” ... but he’s asking us to elect his as POTUS?  #debatenight #goneforrealnow
He "takes advantage" of the laws. He really did say that right?? #debates
Translation please, can you run gov't as a business?Using the "law" to the US gov't's advantage. Isn't the gov't the law? #Debates2016
Law and Order SVU is on at least 10 times today and everyday? #debatenight @realDonaldTrump.
We did not "come up with" the internet. It was an international collabrative effort to share data #Debates2016
Did he just say that  @BarackObama &amp; @HillaryClinton started Isis? Is he fricking crazy!!  #Debates2016
Lester should have a shocked button to press every time someone interrupts   #debatenight
Everyone refuses to call Sean Hannity! Even his wife won't take his calls #debates
Fat person comment. Woah, late in the game. Who had 400 lbs at 70 min in the office pool? #debates
Wow...  @HillaryClinton: He didn't pay any Federal income tax [that year]  @realDonaldTrump: That makes me smart.  #Debates2016
What Trump is describing as "law and order" is a military occupation of black and brown neighborhoods. #debatenight
'ooooh we're going to tax the wealthy and give all the money to YOU! PERSONALLY! You will get so much money! I swear.' Fuck off  #Debates
How is it racist? He said 'Obama needed to prove he was born in the US. I made him do it. I accept it. Move on' #Debates
Trump is so scattered. He should have prepared, even a little. #debatenight
He's coked up and thinks he's in an SNL skit. That's all I can figure. #debatenight #debates
This is what Trump does.... he bullies EVERYONE and yells.... and it's WORKED...... so far #debatenight
Hil and I are both giddy that Trump finally jumped on ramble wagon. "Woo!" #Debates2016
Donald Trump:"Our country is being ripped off by every country we're in business with I'm under a routine audit."#Debates2016
What if Drumpf couldn't repeat his self-affirming sentences?! What would he say??????? #debatenight
No but really, the last question was asked 5 minutes ago (I timed it) #debatenight
STIFF&gt; BANKRUPTCY &gt; KING OF DEBT ...Go Go GO! @HillaryClinton #debatenight  No sir...you did not build an unbelievable company. Fraud.
"I think Trump just tried to criticize me for preparing for this debate. I did. I also prepared to be President" HILARY WINS #debatenight
Oh, Trump. Bringing up the super predator thing is a bit weak when you're trying to support stop and frisk. #debatenight
Trump be like, "I can't even turn on my computer! I ask my grandson how to find porn. But all this cyber is a big deal!" #debatenight
Trump why don't you just answer the god damn question instead of always turning it around to criticize Hillary ?!? #debatenight
"They're not paying their fair share" was a bad argument for Brexit and it's a bad argument about NATO #debates
I would put all my money on the fact that @realDonaldTrump still can't program a VCR #debatenight
can we get rid of the federal government and just have states operate as countries? #debatenight  #secedeUtahplease
Now he is slamming our airports. So remember, if you work for an airline, Trump thinks you are worthless. #Debates2016
"You stayed home." Says the man to the most traveled Secretary of State in our country's history. #DebateNight
let's stop with stop and frisk. it didn't work then, it's not gonna work now. #debatenight
Did... Did he just say he loves Charlotte, partly because of his investments? The privilege hurts. #debatenight
Na Na Na Boo-Boo! I know you are but what am I? #debatenight
Drumpf shows us that he watches his tv with a s/o to law and order #ImWithHer  #DebateNight #debates #Debates2016
Can someone please explain what President Obama have to do with this debate??? He is not on trial. #debatenight #debates
When your entire audience laughs about your "temperament being your strongest asset" 😂😂 Go home @realDonaldTrump you're drunk. #debatenight
"Is this a war torn country?" Yes, it's called the war on drugs. #debates #ImWithHer
Hillary and Trump are both gonna increase spending they won't even address the debt I will #debates #wilcox2036
"He's acting like a five year old kid...he should know better." Wisdom from my 7 year old. #debatenight
Clinton is owning this debate - Trump's thin skin is showing #debatenight
@wikileaks @HillaryClinton doesn't seemed too worried about your plans. I would worry if I was her #debates
As you can see, Hillary's only reasons against Trump are reasons that a preschooler would use... sad #debatenight
Trump’s hotel is not next to the White House. I have been there. Not even close to 1600 PA Ave. -M #debatenight
This is the man running for president people. WAKE UP  ALREADY #debatenight
I give Hillary mad props for not telling Trump to just shut the fuck up. #Debates2016

Losing interest. Blah blah blah. Going to go washable dishes. Haha #DebateNight
Secretary Clinton this is not a forum to discuss personal business matters of Trump or undermine his reputation #debatenight
OR you could just release the fucking returns #Trump. Pretty small request. #debatenight
Really? The USA has become a third world country you snivelling blonde entitled wank puppet? #Debates2016 #HofDebate16 #dumptrump #vote
Please tell me both Arnold and Danny Glover are in Super Predator. #debates
"It's all words, soundbites..."&lt;--- this coming from a man with zero substance who breathes soundbites #debatenight
"Implicit bias is a problem for everyone not just police."  #Sheslays #ImWithHer #debatenight #Debates2016
That one corner of the room cheers at the word "Emails" like Bowling for Soup is finally playing 1985.  #Debates
instead of discussing their country and what they should do for it, they are ramming each other XD #debates #debatenight
As a Muslim Algerian, Libyan neighbor, Libya WAS one of the disasters of @HillaryClinton #debates !
Clinton: it must be something really important, terrible that he wants to hide...on releasing his tax returns  #debatenight
we all knew he would bring up the emails but never wants to bring up he's tax returns #debatenight
I feel like I'm "dancing with the devil in the pale moonlight" watching these two dance around questions #debatenight
If I hear the phrase "call Sean Hannity" one more time, I'm going to hang myself #debatenight
Seems like to me they want to go after the internet so we the people can't connect and dispel the lies they are telling us #debatenight
Man I feel like I'm getting punk'd this can't be our only options for president. #debatenight
Trump if you don't want us to speculate release your returns. #debatenight
Add to to-do list: Learn how to do a shoulder shimmy in a professional manner in front of a national audience. #Hillary #Debates2016
Bring it home, Hillary! About how Trump wouldn't rent to blacks. TRUE.  #Debates2016
Did Trump just say the US is a Third World Country? #Debates2016
I have a winning temperament...YOU were out of control...don't interrupt me moderator! My ninety minutes isn't up yet! #Debates2016
Anyone else see Trump not so much courting new voters as desperately scrambling to hold on to the ones he worries he is losing? #Debates2016
In conclusion, trumps idea of fixing police brutality is... he has property in charlotte #debatenight
what happened to the foundation of our country? when did debates turn into bragging and bashing? WE NEED TO BE UNIFIED. WE NEED RESTORATION.
Oh silly Lester, he doesn't know what the current policy is #debatenight
So how are you gonna heal the racial divide? You just are repeating everything with no solutions? #debatenight #FuckTrump
He did not, no he did not.... Better temperment? #debatenight  I'm so done.
The fact checking needs to be on Hillary. She knows she'll capture the vote of the uninformed. Plus it pulls trump offsides #Debates
Can’t help but start humming the SVU theme song every time Trump says “Law &amp; Order” #DebateNight
"I tend to agree with that quite strongly" is @realDonaldTrump version of "Definitely Maybe" #debatenight
Hillary with such a concise explanation of how to improve the economy. Trump with bluster. #debatenight #ImWithHer
Trump says he doesn't pay people cuz he doesn't like the work... but he also hires only the best &amp; will have best people in WH #DebateNight
Lester Holt is allowing Trump to bully him as well as Hillary.  Bad choice for moderator! #Debates2016
Does Donald even know what he is doing? He had all this time to practice debating yet he still is acting like a child. #debatenight
Donald Trump said many lies on the stage tonight, but his claim of better judgment and temperament than her tickled me the most. #debates
"It's all words" -@realDonaldTrump. Well actually your bankruptcies are public information, so? #debates
Hillary says in addition to criminal justice reform we have to bring communities together. #ImWithHer #Debates2016
Why is Donald Trump obsessed with #stopandfrisk? He doesn't seem to care it was deemed unconstitutional. #Debates2016
When Hillary is over 2 minutes yet does not get interrupted by Lester, I wonder who he wants to win 🤔#DebateNight
How does one "take the oil". It's not a camper trailer, it's billions of gallons of liquid underground! #debatenight
he cant even stand there w/o making facing n movements i cant take him serious this is a friggin joke #debatenight
I think it's really unfair the way Hillary Clinton keeps bringing up things Trump has said and done and also facts. #DebateNight
@realDonaldTrump can't stand that a woman is schooling him - he looks like a fool - BIGLY. #Debates2016 #debatenight
Law &amp; order is code for white supremacist police-state crack down. #Debates2016 #debatenight
If you weren't satisfied with their work, why did you not pay so many people? I'm sure some of them did quality work. #Debates #poorexcuse
Trump also said he'd release his tax returns when Obama released his birth certificate in 2011. #debatenight #debates
#debatenight Hillary prepared for debate &amp; to be president good sound bit. Bet that will make papers
"The fed is doing political." No facts, no policies, lots of yelling...this guy wants to be prez and he can't speak #trump #debates
@LesterHoltNBC shouldn't you be telling Trump to stop interrupting and have some decorum? #debatenight
All Trump does is talk about his businesses and his brand. Nothing of substance or relative at all. #Debates
Stop bragging about what you have (or maybe have? you won't release your tax returns) and answer the question, dude. #Debates2016
The Chinese spread the climate change hoax from their incredible shiny airports. #debatenight
"Jeeeez get to the point Trump" Saying this every day for 4 years before you realise, with fresh horror, that he's President . #debatenight
The "No Fly List" standard is flawed as it doesn't afford citizens due process yet takes away constitutional right. #debatenight
Excuse you Trump one voice at a time raise your hand quietly please...My 3rd graders know this I mean... #debatenight
So when are we actually going to get real debate questions? #whereislester #debatenight #debates2016 #ImWithHer
Doh... Trump: I have been all over the place, you have been at home... smh #debatenight
Hilary is so calm and I am living for it  #Debates
🚽 can't talk about any programs or plans because he has none. I I I Istop taking trash! What r you going to do for the USA ? #Debates2016
The fact checker thingy on Hillary's website is called Literally Trump.  She's so millennial right now #debatenight
#debatenight if #chicago is so bad @realDonaldTrump why did you build a hotel there. Can we say #TAXBREAKS
#debatenight when my nephew go to get a pack of cigarettes and is slammed on the police car because his pants are low #racial profiling
Do not be deceived America! Though she speaks conservatively, her primary loyalty is to sustain liberal &amp; Obama Admin. agenda. #Debates
"I will take the Admieals &amp; the Generals anyday instead of the political hacks that led this country in their so-called knowledge." #Debates
Anytime Donald Trump writes on the legal pad I imagine he is drawing women with huge jugs, his term not mine #Debates2016
🤔🤔 #Debates2016 is #Trump nose 👃 stopped up? Did anybody 👂🏾 him sniffing? That girl got him gone huh #snowman 🤔🤔
Talking about shootings in Chicago. LET'S TALK ABOUT HOW MANY BLACK PEOPLE HAVE BEEN MURDERED BY POLICE THIS YEAR. #debatenight
I have a much better temperament than she does. — Are you f’n kidding me??? #DebateNight
"We've got to address the systemic racism in our criminal justice system. We cannot just say 'law and order.'" #debatenight
Hillary looks at Donald most of the time when he speaks, while Donald looks mostly down or at Hillary when she talks #debatenight
"O'k yes when I was young working for my father's company I beat a man to death but I've been to Philadelphia" #debatenight #Debates2016

Oh oh, drugged witch just stuck her foot in her mouth. Wait for it....#debatenight
I prepared for the debate and being president. By staying home... #debates
Clinton quotes FLOTUS DNC speech: "When they go low, we go high... Barack Obama went high." #DebateNight
My takeaway from #debatenight is that Donald knows Donald is awesome and rich and smart.
Trump: "I opened a club and wasn't  discriminatory" - someone get this guy a medal. #debatenight
It's really really hard to be a worse presidential candidate than Hillary and Trump makes it look easy #debatenight
Donald talkin about actin "holier than tho" when he doin the same shit wit ted cruz!!! #DebateNight
"It could be Russia." Yes, Trump, let's blame everybody for everything.   #debatenight
#Debates2016 Do the disenfranchised want 2 hear u made over $600 million @realDonaldTrump Getting audited isn't something 2 brag about.
#Debates2016 the real @realDonaldTrump is out tonight. His behavior is cringeworthy even if u don't like him. #StopTrump
The toilet, I love the toilet. I have property in there #debatenight
This is just what we need! A president who can complain, but is too incompetent to make a plan! #debatenight
@MrcGnzls @GovGaryJohnson @BerinSzoka so he or she knows where to send our troops pointlessly? #letgarydebate #debates
Is it me or was the question, how are you going to address racism in our country?! How did we jump to guns/policing/law&amp;order? #Debates2016
@SophiaBush And what do you call her destroyed emails?  She's so #vile her own husband has to rape other women! #debatenight

@CNN #Debates birther issue he claims victory?  No apology? What an ass.
"We should have taken the oil from Iraq," Trump says. "And now [ISIS] have the oil all over the place." #debatenight
No matter what this country will have flaws with either president #Debates
realDonaldTrump: As soon as Clinton releases her 33,000 emails, I will release my returns #USElections2016 #DebateNight
Hillary Clinton: We have got to defeat ISIS  and dismantle their online propaganda #DebateNight
Did he just brag about how much money he has, and then say he should be Prez bc he has money? #Debates
Trump says he has a better temperament. Audience titters. Finally goes to HRC and audience is relieved. HRC wins. #DebateNight #NeverTrump
Just realized I have been holding my breath this whole time. I think Donald might actually be having a stroke. #debatenight
I don't fuck w Hillary but let me tell you, she is drAGGING trump and I am living #debatenight
Newsflash Donald, the President has to deal with multiple threats all the time. And you're neither qualified not experienced. #debatenight
Clinton is using soundbites Trump is telling the truth we have to go trump #DebateNight #Hilary #Trump

I'm pretty sure the word "right" above @realDonaldTrump right shoulder is meant to be read sarcastically.  #debatenight
#Debates2016 Learning that following comedians and actors is hilarious....unless the debates are going on.  #stayinyourlane
I wanted to drink a zip of wine everytime @realDonaldTrump interrupted @HillaryClinton.... My wine is over🙃#notevenhalfwaythere #debates2016
When you’re opponent responds to your argument with, “just listen to what you just heard”, you ain’t winning that debate. #DebateNight
Trump said him not paying federal income tax was smart of him. Just as smart as saying he doesn't pay taxes in a debate. #debatenight
There's an episode of @vice that featured one of his international properties and the modern slavery that's building it. #debatenight
"Trumped-Up Trickle Down"  Gotta agree with her there. Never again. #debatenight
"So how do we win the war in Iraq? INVADE AND NEVER LEAVE!" -Donald Trump- #debatenight

Oh, so they should be laying their fair share but it's ok if you don't? K. Got it. Cool. #DebateNight
ok. I heard the heavy sniff. Trump trying to keep his head from exploding. #debates
If #Hillary wanted "Law and Order" she would have to throw herself IN JAIL. #debatenight #PresidentialDebate
Clinton points out work she did to "put a lid on Iran's nuclear program. That's diplomacy." #debatenight
Hillary the federal government shouldn't be providing me with anything. Their job is to protect my individual rights #debatenight

Oh yes, let me pat another old white man on the back for being nice to someone who is not an old white man #debatenight #ImWithHer
Donald Trump black people aren't voting for you. Get over it. #NeverTrump #debatenight
Ok pretty sure that Trump doesn't know what unconstitutional means nor how the legal system works #debatenight
That's how settlements work!! You don't admit guilt! It doesn't mean you aren't guilty!! #debatenight
#debatenight Hillary just took it 'to the streets' on @donaldtrump with a smile. He's real quiet now...
#DebateNight Hillary could win this debate by just staying silent and letting Donald talk.
Cinton says Trump didn't pay corporate taxes. Trump's retort: "That makes me smart." #debatenight
Why don't they just turn the mic off when it's not their turn? #Debates2016
"I have a better temperament than she does" *snickers in the audience* #debatenight
.@ScottFordTVGuy you like how @realDonaldTrump is doing tonight? I think he is doing incredible!!! #PresidentialDebate #DebateNight
Trump: "You don't real learn a lot from a tax return." Yeah, that's why the audit...  #Debates
He's only worried about his stockpiles of money outside of the country #debates
Trump exemplifies the worst of America 🇺🇸 on display for the world to see!  #Debates2016
73% cost of NATO to dominate world ideology seems about right #debatenight
If these candidates were strips of bacon they'd both be charred. #Debates
God damn! Lincoln just threw down some sick truths yo. Guys got potential. Dying to see what he'd do next. #debates #lincolnisdead
Trump talks about race: "two words: law and order" ... Wow.... #debatenight

"It's all words" You really don't have the right to say that, General MacArthur quoting ass #debates
My debate experience: mom yells at trump while dad plays clash of clans #debatenight
I say we just put Trump and Hillary in a ring and let them duke it out Rocky vs Apollo style. #Debates2016
She's right. He doesn't have any idea that foreign policy works on a degree of statesmanship. He has none. He's a shopkeeper #debatenight
Why we talking about what someone else is doing? What about YOU Trump. So quick to divert attention from himself. #debatenight
We have abandoned the wine glass. Straight bottle to the face at this point. #Debates2016
Linking Hillary to Janet Yellen is pathetic.  The Fed is by law independent. #debates2016
I can't believe Donald is really gonna be on the Ballot 2 become president of the United States,this election is a Big Joke🤔#debatenight
Did Donald Trump just say he has a better temperament ? He has YELLED this entire debate #debatenight are you kidding ??

#Debates2016 #DebateNight And here we go with the stupid anti-gun bullshit. Fuck you Hillary. Seriously.
#Debates2016 #DebateNight So, is this Hillary, or her clone? Because I really can't tell right now. It's a good clone is what I'm saying.

@realDonaldTrump, I've actually lived in a third world country, and the U.S. is far from it. #debates
@realDonaldTrump I don't think you even know or understand what the fuck you just vomited out of your tiny, little mouth. #debatenight
I gonna go out on a limb and say most of America is over this crap. Move on.  #debatenight
Ok so Trump is taking out ISIS and that 400lb hacker.  SOLD!  #debatenight
"Often it's the blacks, Hispanics, illegal immigrants with guns!" ...there's why Trump has support from likes of KKK! #DebateNight
I was upset at first bc i don't have cable but it turns out the CNN app has a live stream of the debate- god bless. #debatenight

My wife just said this debate makes her proud to have a vagina. #debatenight
This fucker (pardon my language) is seriously advertising his hotel ON A PRESIDENTIAL DEBATE. For God's sakes. #debatenight
watching my twitter feed is BY FAR the best way i have ever watched the debates before.  the commentary popping up is genius...
"And we need Law &amp; Order SVU and Law &amp; Order Miami and all the other tremendous Law &amp; Orders" - #Trump #debates #debatenight
#Debates Gun violence? Wake up! Some of last few terrorists attacks involved a truck and knives and incendiaries. There is no GUN (NEXT

Donald Trump trying to get Russia out of the hook on the hack #debatenight
My GOD this man is actually telling the FACT checkers that they're wrong #debatenight
Trump: "You don't learn a lot from tax returns. You learn from financial disclosures" Aren't tax returns financial disclosures? #debatenight
FACT: Trump brings in new immigrants to work at his resorts in Florida.  Don't believe he will make many jobs for US citizens. #debates
@realDonaldTrump is making a fool of himself by speaking like a 5 year trying to convince his mom to have a dozen cookies #debatenight
OMG, can #Trump attempt to pronounce Terror again. We need that on loop. It's like George W trying to talk all over again #Debates
Yes, a lot of places were sued with housing discrimination... because there is  A LOT OF DISCRIMINATION. #debatenight
Is Donald Trump's 10 year old son a hacker?   Where do these stories go? Bizarre.   He just word vomits at times #debatenight
Trump: We beat that housing discrimination rap, why you bringin that shit up? #Debates2016
I've never been in an US airport that resembled a third world country. #debates #NeverTrump
#debatenight "I prepared to be president" Why did people clap at that? If that is the most FIRE thing she said, Trump already won.
Where is Ashton Kutcher... this has got to be the most elaborate Punk'd ever #debatenight
I need more information on what they are going to do this back &amp; forth of who did what is stupid  #Debates
Don't make agreements with @therealdonald_ apparently he agreed to be quiet when @HillaryClinton talked during the #TheDebate #debatenight
As a person who remembers Yahoo chat rooms in the early 2000's I really wish Trump would stop calling it "cyber" #DebateNight
#debates tell him Hilary why so many murders in Chicago. It's because anyone can buy a gun trump, this is what u support
#Trump says "it's just business" referring to the housing collapse where people lost jobs and homes. #debatenight #NeverTrump
Uh oh. They're talking about race. Curated somber faces on now. #debatenight
Hillary's trying to win by using comedic timing, people. Her points are terrible. She literally only has comedy going for her. #debatenight
is donald trump BRAGGING about how much money he has????????? wtf????? #Debates2016
He doesn't think Obama is 'his' President which shows us a lot about this clown. #racism #neverchangeDonald #debates
If I had done a drinking game for #debatenight I would be wasted just in the last minute by what the 🌽🌽🌽🌽🌽🌽🌽 said
Here we go...America's racist, especially the Law enforcement community... Hillary's clueless. #debatenight
#debatenight #Trump: the #Birther issue is preventing an effective response to ISIS?  Really?
Clinton on Trump's birther claims: It was a racist lie with no evidence #debatenight @CQNow @rollcall
I don't care abt DT's taxes. If he had done anything wrong, the IRS would have him in jail. So that's all there is to it. #debates #tcot
Hillary actually argued Trump's comments abt hacking are "concerning," she had a unsecure server where she stored classified info! #Debates
I'm sorry. I haven't flown around the world lately enough to compare other airports to USA airports. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯  #debatenight
@LesterHoltNBC You are a terrible person. A man in your position should not be biased. Play fair. #debatenight #Debates2016
Our mom actually made us popcorn after we joked that its great entertainment #debatenight
How does yelling over each other prove your point or cutting off the man who is proposing your debate questions? Respect ppl. #Debates2016
Trump having any knowledge on race relations is surprising. Ben Carson taught him well. #debatenight
Trump just implied his son Barron (real name, I checked) hacked the DNC. Way to throw your kin under the bus, Donald. #Debates2016
If @realDonaldTrump wants to bring back American business from overseas he should start with his own Trump brands. #Debates2016 #debate
When you gotta fill your speaking time, repeat yourself in 3 different ways. #debatenight
The drinking game for the evening should be a shot for every sniff Trump makes. Try some Allegra bub. #debatenight
It looks like #Trump did some research on the internet about gangs in Chicago before #debatenight
If we took the oil wouldn't that beet looting? And against international law #CNN #msnbc #nbc #fox #foxnews #debatenight
this is probably gonna go off the air with one of them still talking. #debates2016
Y'all are mad that Trump doesn't pay taxes? Neither does Jackie Chan and y'all gave him a pass.  #debatenight #Debates2016
Look let's face it. #Trump need to pay up re Obama's birth certificate. Where is the $5 million @realDonaldTrump. 😂 #debatenight
Been 20 minutes &amp; Hillary's already fallen in Trumps trap. By responding to jabs, she lets him make 10 more, only 1 on topic. #debatenight
Oh boy is she gonna talk about pepe for this race question? #debates
Really wish Trump would have made a 'How many people has Bill stiffed joke'. Guess he does have a lil class. #debates #Debates2016
"the record shows I'm right"… i am going to try that tomorrow with my boss #debatenight
Gee yes let's take guns away that will help the race issue 🙄🙄 #debatenight
People love me. People think I'm great. I let black people golf at my golf course. Me me me. #debatenight
"the record shows that im right" he's like a child having a tantrum #debates
Trump "got" Obama to produce his birth certificate but then continued to question his country of birth for the next 5 years #debatenight
He has said so many words I forgot the question... Which I think is what he wants? #Debates2016
I don't know, America. I'd worry about a president who couldn't tell the number 5 from the number 6 #debatenight
Trump: I'll release my tax returns once she released the emails  Moderator: So, it's negotiable? Trump: NO! #WHAT  #debates
The wheels are starting to come off. Lester Holt is gonna have a hard time controlling this one. #debatenight
My son. He gets into this thing called Minecraft. Huge buildings in it. Huge. The best.  #debatenight
"400 pound guy on his bed".... Donald Trump just ripped his own 4chan base. #debatenight
HRC looks like she's having fun up there, good for her. #debatenight
Is it just me, but every time Trump says "believe me!" I hear Naruto saying "DATTEBAYO!!!!" #debates
Me: SHUT UP! SHUT UP! SHUT UP! I'LL PUNCH YOU IN THE FUCKING FACE I HATE HIM SO MUCH #me #wine #debatenight
twitter is depressing. this debate is depressing. I hate that November 8th keeps getting closer. #debatenight
@ClamsEsq HRC: you never pay. DJT: it would be squandered too.   Yikes. Logical trap there. He admits he doesn't pay. #Debates2016
Well . .. just listen to what you heard! Another good shot from @HillaryClinton ! #debates #debatenight #Debates2016
I feel like I'm watching two 12 year olds argue 🙄 #debatenight
Criminal justice reform is important -- but not because of race. #Debates
HILARY AND TRUMP SHOULD DROP IT AND HE SHOULD TAKE HER OUT TO DINNER #debatenight
This guy LITERALLY does not make ANY sense. At all. It's just braggy statements and personal attacks. #debatenight
@MSignorile #debatenight @realDonaldTrump so inner cities are synonymous with African American communities? You need to get out more.
#Trump supports #russia and President Putin over Latinos (Mexico) that is bizarre on geographical lines #debatenight
#tytlive #debatenight I really want to see Bernie here...so much...I think this all the time...
#tytlive #debatenight YOU ARE THE FACT CHECKER!!   now, right now, after doesn't matter.
A bunch of morons who can't spell "Hillary" got "Hilary" trending. Brilliant. #debatenight #debates #Debates2016
You didn't pay small biz owners because you WEREN'T satisfied?!?!? WHAT in the HOLY FUCK? #debatenight
#debatenight wait, so is Obama actually keeping this country together? According to Donald the shit will hit the fan  as soon as he leaves.
the endorsement of every police officer in the United States is not an encouraging thing to hear, trump. it's fucking TERRIFYING #debates
Weird having brother and sister running against each other for POTUS. #debatenight
"I'd prepare to be President...(not only for debate)" says Clinton! Applauses... #Debates2016

RT NomikiKonst: "I will release my tax returns as soon as she releases her 33,000 emails." -HillaryClinton #Debates2016
Trump is doing an excellent job backing up his statements, Iove it #DebateNight #Debates
I opened up a club, a great club. The club doesn't discriminate because it is such a great club and I'm so proud. #debatenight
A debate is not a summary of all the wrongdoings of your opponent. Trump is reducing himself to a 3rd grade tattle-tale #Debates
What the hell does Hillary know about cyber security?  I guess if we get attacked she knows how to use bleach bit. #debatenight
This is why Mussolini didn't participate in debates. His head would've burst. #PresidentialDebate #RedactedTonight
RT LiberalLaChick: LOL A different kind of warfare. HRC can't even remember to forget her talking points. #debatenight #debates #Debates2016
.@clayaiken She is fighting back in a PRESIDENTIAL way. She isn't a bully. She has class. #debatenight
I love that Trump gets in a plug for his new DC hotel during the debate. Shameless. #debatenight
#Withher or not, 'who's winning' is not disputable. If you're tweeting how they're 'both terrible', you just don't look smart, soz. #debates
This is word salad.  How is this clownshoe a presidential candidate???? #ImWithHer #debatenight
Wait, he's got "investments" in Chicago, but stays away from the tough community of Palm Beach ? #debatenight #debates
@realDonaldTrump will release his tax returns when #HRC releases the 33k emails...he's on fire! #debatenight #Debates2016 #debates
Anybody else want to slap the smug look off that prick's face? I mean Steve. #StrangerThings #Debates2016
Clinton reveals she put an architect Trump allegedly stiffed in the audience. Trump: "Maybe he didn't do a good job" #debatenight
"I was one of many, many bigots, &amp; I got out of it without admitting fault." #debates #debatenight
Trump thinks an airport is the worst thing a third world country has to worry about. #Debatenight
Can't wait to see @KellyannePolls try to mop up the mess #Trump has left. First she'll have to "blow" his nose though. #Debates2016
Donald keeps sniffling...probably cancer. I hope he can make it through without dying. That's how it works, right? #Debates2016
Trump! stop using adjectives and adverbs,say what you mean...oh wait...you got nothing. #debatenight #trumpdidaHUGErailofcocaine #sniff
His voters are going to vote for him no matter what. This's about the undecideds n maybe Hilary supports. She's killing him #DebateNight
Love that he managed to throw a fat shaming comment in there. I was worried. #debatenight #Debates2016
Oh shit the race questions. Twitter is about to be very divided #Debates
She is much more measured &amp; nuanced than he is, by far.  He's hammering his themes.  Impossible for the audience to miss.  #debatenight
We are all ignoring the important question: WHO IS THIS 400 lb HACKER?! #Debates #debatenight
Someone from the Trump campaign literally went and deleted his Chinese Global Warming Conspiracy tweet DURING THIS DEBATE. #debatenight
This pitch from Trump isn't about African Americans. It's a dog whistle to moderate whites to make them think he's not so bad. #debatenight
"I prepared to be President and I think that's a good thing." OH MY GOD SHE DID. #debatenight
#Belize you got my back if I need a new life? Lol #Debates
Trying to watch the debate...the sound is out of sync with the picture, making it even more painful. #debatenight
#debatenight  what us Trump talking about with 'cyber' its like he doen't know what that means.
Great if you own a computer you are 400 # pounds Debates
Braggadocious: adj, meaning boastful or arrogant.' Like the only relevant thing I've learned from this debate #DebateNight
He just said i.e. not paying people- he was simply taking advantage of laws, and if you dont like it, change the laws #debatenight #debates
Gotta ask my boss tomorrow if he is a "very against police judge." #Debates2016
So our country is about law and order.  None of that freedom stuff or civil liberties, just law and order. #debatenight
Donald Trump I'm a minority. &amp; I don't live in the inner city.  #debatenight
Did Trump just say when it comes to nuclear weapons, he wouldn't take anything off the table? #debatenight
I don't even need to watch the rest I know who's won the debate #debatenight
Has no one ever taught Donald Trump how to have a debate? #debatenight
You learn quite a lot from tax returns, actually, Mr Trump. That's why you aren't releasing them. #debatenight
So basically Trump is saying we shouldn't be the only ones defending the free world. I guess? #RussiaHasNewerTech #debates
Wow, Lester called out Trump on his audit malarkey. Didn't think that would happen. #debatenight
But now a stop and frisk can mean your death.     #Debates
Hillary, along with teammate Obama &amp; funded by evil globalist Soros, is the author of all this racebaiting  #DebateNight  #debates
Trump never supported war in Iraq  #CrookedHillary is the warmonger candidate  #CrookedHillary is globalist's candidate of choice  #Debates
At this point, I'm about 90% sure Trump doesn't pay taxes. That's fucking crazy though #DebateNight
And then he tells Lester he's  wrong &amp; Lester lets himself get bullied. Trump's 2 min warning exceeds limit. #debatenight
Repeating something over and over again does not make it true! Try answering a question without changing the subject. #Debates
@brianefallon he is showing his true colors and Americans need to see it ! #debatenight
So Donald only cares about cities because he has businesses and investments there... Cool. #debates
@Schreids Hilary is best served to let him talk. He's making no sense. #debatenight
Debates should play video of any contradiction that a candidate has mentioned...  "Well in 2001 you said.."::plays clip::
This is painful to watch as a woman. It physically hurts. #debatenight
"Sometimes things that happened in business would be bad for the government." @HillaryClinton 👏🏻 #debatenight #roorxn
@RonnieFilyaw Oh, you're not watching the debates? You are wise beyond your years.
#debates Okay, so we're agreed, right? "trumped up" is the shot trigger
Everyone is watching the debates and I'm over here watching another episode of Grey's
Trump apparently practiced for the debates by shrieking at a burning trash can in a back alley for seven hours straight.
#debatenight Why didn't anyone jump all over John McCain about his birth certificate?  He WASN'T born in the States.
I think the most syllables in a word I heard from Trump just now was "Secretary." #DebateNight
This might be the wine talking, but I think he's mispronouncing "terror." #WatchOutForTara #DebateNight
He spoke of the #NRA "protecting the constitution" in the same breath as "stop and frisk". #Contradiction #debates #INSANITY
#Debates2016  #debates  I knew Trump was going 2 bring up the darn emails... *Then u hear the CLAPPING in the background WOW!!
Hey Hillary when you talk about #NATO Why did we not defend the Ukraine and Crimea? they request article 5 but we were silent.  #debates
Instead of preparing for the debate by reviewing issues and policies, Hillary should've chased chickens and punched slabs of meat. #debates
Clinton throwing some shade over why Trump will not release his tax returns #debatenight
#debatenight where it's not about America but it's about which pretentious blonde can point his/her finger best.

Awwww....give #Birther Trump a big racist cookie (white chocolate chips only). This fucking surreal😳  #debates  #debatenight
#debatenight is reality TV. Trump is real and Clinton saying same old stuff we've heard for years!
He randomly just talked about his son for like 10 seconds for literally no reason, apart from saying 'he is good at computers' #debatenight
"But oil is a huge part of the countries economy..." "ISIS" "We'd have to be in the country to take it... "ISIS" #debatenight
"I prepared for this debate and I've prepared to be president." MY QUEEN. #debates
now....this question is about race and the cops....why is he talking about Chicago  ? 🤔 #Debates
Hey America, @realDonaldTrump just said your country is like a 3rd world country.  That's national pride? That's respect?  #Debatenight #Cnn
Trump could give $1.50 to every American from his income last year #debatenight
Yeeeeah... @realDonaldTrump needs to address his abuse of his unfulfilled business obligations #debatenight
Hillary has a lot of stats. Like, a lot of numbers. Clearly prepared, but seems slightly scripted #debatenight
Trump is verbally, metaphorically and geographically running circles around this question #debatenight
Every single person in America right now - "Why are these the two we picked?" #debatenight
Jfc Lester holt -- if you can't fact check, can you at least keep this shit in line? #debatenight
Trump - "I take advantage of the laws of the nation," not follow them, or respect them, but "takes advantage." WTF? #Debates2016 #ImWithHer
He just INSISTS on using my city in his empty, foolish ass rhetoric... 😒😒😒#Chicago #debates #debatenight
Stop and frisk is racist and so is @realDonaldTrump. He was born rich and white; no idea about the reality of Black America. #Debates2016
There you go, gun reform for Hillary. She will take guns. #Debates2016 #HofDebate16
#debates "According the the Wall Street Journal, Trump's father came to his rescue repeatedly with multiple loans." - Scott Horsley
How to gone have good community relation when cops gunning down the community #Debates
I'd pay to see Lester's face when he was told he had to run this debate #Debates2016
I opposed Iraq War. FALSE. He didn’t express opposition until over a year after invasion - @realDonaldTrump #Debates2016
I knew this was going to be like this. Donald came out looking mad #debatenight
LOL. Most of HRC's commercials on Trump are just actual quotes he's said in interviews. #takeaseat #debates #ImWithHer
Can we just get Bernie back for the race segment, like an intermission? #Debates2016
It's really amazing how Trump can keep a straight face while talking about taxes #Debates2016
It's dead obvious who is more suited to lead already, but that won't be why people vote this time around which is very scary. #Debates
..I'm a sit back and watch non registered voters tweet about the #DebateNight
#Debates2016  Wow so who's behind the birther thing?   @HillaryClinton  #sidneyblomenthal
"Treated Obama with disrespect"..... Trump what do you think you do??? #debatenight
I am so offended at how dumb Truml thinks Americans are, "I have a much better temperament"..... whet???? #debatenight
@realDonaldTrump tells the truth here. The stock market is a bubble supported by a political Fed. He is scoring points now. #Debates2016
Did he just say getting Obama to produce his birth certificate is his way of fighting Isis? This man is an idiot. #Debates2016 #NeverTrump
If you stayed home from the campaign trail in order to prepare for this debate you wasted your time @HillaryClinton #Debates2016 #debates
Drug control doesn't work, according to Hillary. GUN CONTROL, that'll work though! #Debates2016 #debatenight
It's nice for the attention to be on America instead of bullying us British over Brexit #debatenight #Debates #USPresidentialDebate
Please speak over her again, @realDonaldTrump - I promise us ladies LOVE that #debatenight
&amp; why do we care about what was in Clinton's emails. We know she's a snake, emails won't prove that. #debates
But what if Trump is behind all these creepy clown costumes we keep hearing about?? 😱 #debates
yeah yeah yeah, we all know Donald Trump is a racist piece of shit. #debatenight
So it's Obama's fault there's so many shootings in Chicago because he's from there? #confused #debatenight @realDonaldTrump makes no sense
LMFAO DID TRUMP JUST LEAN INTO THE MIC AND BURP ON NATIONAL TELEVISION #debatenight
This is so funny to watch, but it's sad to realize that Trump still has a realistic chance. #debatenight
#DonaldTrump your buddy at Colony investmentment dumped you for the old post office project in DC #Debates

I think Donald Trump got into the Halloween Candy early this year!! #debatenight #Debates2016 #PresidentialDebate
Why would you ever say that stop and frisk was a good plan for New York City.... #Debates
I don't have the sanity to spare, but I hope someone is keeping track of his interruptions #debatenight
FYI @realDonaldTrump--there's a microphone designed for amplifying voices five inches from your lips. Let it work for you.  #debatenight
Trump: "I'm endorsed by the NRA."  N.R.A. - No Really, Assholes.   #Debates2016
Clinton uses a classic Trump "hiding" move, interesting. Fast paced, critical thinking. #debatenight
Trump are you going to blame the rise in gun violence on president Obama? #DebateNight
@piersmorgan Trump is about to drown from all the water he is drinking to help him stay alive in this debate! LOL!  #debatenight
TRUMP THINKS SOMETHING IS A TERRIBLE THING TO SAY.  Wut.  #Debates2016
We have  to get guns out of hands of people who should not have them ! Thanks Mrs Clinton #debates2016
This debate is making me nauseous. The amount of disrespect and unprofessionalism coming from @realDonaldTrump is astounding. #debatenight
#cokeheadtrump found some body shaming to add to his other purpose license bigotry.  "Maybe someone who's 400lbs" or China. #debates
Biff Tannen's Pleasure Paradise will only be .8 miles from the @WhiteHouse.  Let's hope it's the closest Trump gets. #debates #debatenight
Someone pls find this article where Trump said he was against the war. I'm counting on you internet #debatenight
Neither of them will listen to the moderator. This could be problematic. #debatenight #debates #Debates2016
But Trump, mainstream media is the reason you're here right now... #debatenight #debates #Debates2016
Trump is suffering from a head cold brought on by his secret AIDS, it's pretty obvious. #debatenight
4000 murders in 8 years(sorry 7 3/4) doesn't seem that high to me in a major city #HillaryClinton #debates #debatenight #ClintonVsTrump
All I'm asking is that this ass stay on topic  #debatenight
I just don't understand why Trump keeps talking over Clinton, like you had your time. Let her speak, she didn't interrupt you😒 #debatenight
Implicit bias is a problem everywhere, jot just American Police, says Hillary... As a #Nepali, I can't agree more... #debatenight
Debate with #Trump for some time and even Hillary Clinton develops sense of humor... Surprised? Anyone? #debatenight
When @realDonaldTrump doesn't pay taxes it "makes me smart," when the bottom 50% do the same, they're deadbeats and slackers. #debatenight
Birther much? Name dropping instead of answering the question. Git him, Lester! #debatenight
Florida has the wealthiest community in the world?! That's news to everyone else 😂 @realDonaldTrump #Debates2016 #debatenight #PONYisms
Clinton: We need gun control a lil.  Republicans: SHE TAKIN OUR GUNS Trump: We need gun control a lil.  Republicans: All hail. #debatenight
How does proving Obama was born in the US has to do with defeating ISIS? #debatenight
Shorter Hillary: We only want your money and you haven't paid, Donald. #debatenight
Where is the IRS? I hope they're online! @realDonaldTrump seems so proud that he's not paying tax. What! #debate #Debates2016 #debatenight
@ShaunKing Donald doesn't look as orange as usual. Wonder what the over/under on his outbursts is 😂😂😂 #debatenight
Trump admits he doesn't pay taxes and doesn't pay his contractors. How Presidential. #debatenight
We need to all chip in for noise canceling headphones for @HillaryClinton... or maybe a muzzle? #Debates2016
#Debates a report I just saw?  My goodness. Please. Conservative or not. The man is a boob
#Debates 400 pounds? He has lost it. Hackers? R u all 400 lbs? R there any skinny hackers? This guy generalizes everybody.
How the fuck is Law and Order gone help the situation??? Isnt that how we got here in the first place #debatenight
Trump doesn't release his tax returns bc he's hiding a lot. #Debates2016
.@HillaryClinton one second: "our police are outgunned"  Next second: our police are too deadly.   Which is it? #Debates2016
Although I told myself I wouldn't watch the debate, it has been my favorite comedy series lately! #debatenight
Law and Order-  Minority Neighborhoods  Serve and Protect- White and Upperclass  #debatenight
At all  RT @4nalyst: funny thing is that trump supporters arent middle or upper class. #DebateNight
I don't invest in our country's future, education, or our national security and "That makes me smart" #Debates
#DebateNight H is not good at this. We need to pray that the conscious of the general public is heavier than her ineptitude at live debate
Whenever I have children it will be sad to tell them about my generation.  #debatenight
I can't stand listening or even looking at her. she is nuts !!! #DebateNight
US is waging global war, with strikes in Yemen, Somalia, Pakistan, Libya- none of which have been named yet. #warwhatwar? #debatenight
Way to bring it back to the question, @HillaryClinton. Wrap it up and mop the floor with his toupee. #debatenight #ImWithHer #election2016
Watching the #Debates2016 is like watching your parents getting divorce all over again #yikes
I just literally LOL'd when Lester Holt interrupted @realDonaldTrump by saying "we really need to move on" #debatenight
Clinton is holding it in as Trump claims to have forced Obama to release his birth certificate #debatenight
Yeah you deserve credit Donald for not illegally discriminating in your clubs. #jackass #sarcasm #debatenight
Can we apply the hearsay rule to this debate? I'm tired of hearing of what #Trump's friends say #Debates2016
BREAKING:  With 90 percent of the vote, Americans have declared Jose Cuervo the winner of tonight's Presidential debate.  #Debates2016
On a scale from 1 to Scarface, how much Coke did Trump do before the debate? #Debates2016
I watched Obama/Hillary debates back in the day believe it or not (not the whole things) but this is way more entertaining
Its funny how hilliary can respect him when he's talking but he can't do the same .😂 #debatenight
Donald trump has pneumonia let's talk shit about how his blue tie doesn't compliment the hue of his Oompa Loompa skin #debatenight
Who do what?! We wanted Trump to do what?! And another sip #Debates2016
Trump, this ain't who wants to be a millionaire! ain't no #PhoneAFriend!! tryna call witnesses to the stand! we see you! #debatenight
Very rich (quite literally) that @realDonaldTrump complains about poor infrastructure while he proudly admits he pays no taxes. #debatenight
.@HillaryClinton making a strong point about systemic racism and implicit bias — the latter something we all have, she says. #debatenight
On my second glass of wine after Trump says he got Obama to produce his birth certificate #debatenight
Those Muslim allies include Sisi who killed a 1000 ppl a day. I'd rather take the insults then have ppl ally with him. #debatenight
As a nation, we are all holding this L for the next 4 years #debatenight
Sounds like we have two options, kids. Get out the vote or live in a police state. #debatenight
HE CAN RELEASE HIS TAXES EVEN IF IF HE'S BEING AUDITED!  #Debates2016
Hillary was done with it the second he opened his mouth and shook his tiny hands #debatenight
You don't not pay someone cause you're unhappy with there job and then continue to use what they made for you. @realDonaldTrump #debatenight
Talking about your investment and business does not reflect ANYTHING about your ability to run a country. #Debates2016
Her: We must contest ISIS online &amp; on battlefield Him: Russia something cyber something something 400-lb something  #ImWithHer #Debates2016
Undecideds: How does this attitude work for you? Trump: "I take advantage of the laws of the nation." Can you do that? #debates
I need to do homework, but this debate is surprisingly entertaining #debatenight
Does #Trump sound like an idiot during the whole thing, or is he relatively competent when #Raw isn't at commercial? #Debates
Implicit bias is a major issue here in the US. I wonder how they can manage it? #debatenight
No, Mr. Trump. You haven't established shit with the African American community. #debatenight
Notice how Hillary calls us the black community and Donald the African American community......he's afraid of us #DebateNight
Thank you for clearing up the Iraq troop exit HRC. The has been spouting ignorance on that for a long time. #Debates2016
You know he is going to leave this debate and declare victory. #Debates2016
To be fair, he's your president too, since we only have one. Unless YOU'RE the one who isn't an American.... #debatenight
Today we've learned Trump watches too much law and order SVU and tv scripted versions of "hackers" #Debates2016
"China should go into North Korea" Okay Donald, it's time for a nappy nap #debates
I don't care who started the birther movement because I know they both tried to profit from it. They're both scum. #debatenight
Hey HRC, thugs, gangs, crooks will get guns no matter what.  Get a clue clown girl.  #debatenight #debates #Debates2016
If Donald Trump has a good temperament, then I'm the Queen of Sheba. 👸🏼#WhereIsMyCrown #debatenight
Hillary is playing the race card on law enforcement big time. Looks desperate. #debatenight
Crying for my country. Just let it sink in that one of these people is going to be our next President. #Debates2016
#debatenight @realDonaldTrump The only thing good in the economy is the market.  Raise interest rates, it collapses. SO TRUE!!!
Does he care about how things go in cities where he has NO investments? #Debates2016
Ya he's underbudget because he stiffs his workers for no damn reason. #debates
Trump saying he has the temperate to me president is like allowing a kid screaming when he doesn't get candy to be president #DebateNight
"MY STRONGEST ASSET IS MY TEMPERAMENT. MY WINNING ASSET IS MY TEMPERAMENT." DOES DONALD KNOW WHAT TEMPERAMENT MEANS???? #debatenight
.@realDonaldTrump finally speaks the truth! He built an "unbelievable" company. That's for sure. #debatenight #ImWithHer
General MacArthur derp ISIS whole adult life derp yelling silly hair gray derp everything is your fault derp.  -Donald Trump  #debatenight
How exactly is the president's birth certificate pertaining to race relations? It's not. #debatenight
they're both rude and annoying i don't want either of them as the president of this country #Debates2016
If you get audited so much that should raise red flag! #debatenight
So, I think Trump's body needs a ton of hydration. How does he still have water in that cup? #HofDebate16 #debatenight #debates2016
He, himself, just literally said  "financial statement... of sorts"  then did one of those, "eh, not really" head-shoulder things #debates
Gangs of Illegals mentioned. Oh boy, this is about to spiral out of control #debatenight
If only our wealthy paid their fair share--to women, to minimum wage American taxpayers, to IRS, we might have better airports. Duh.#Debates
Billionaire tax-avoider bothered by countries who don't pay their fair share. Haaaahahahahaha #Debates
His "they have to pay their fair share" thing displays psychotic lack of self-awareness. #Debates
the fact that he's literally not answering any of these questions lol👎🏾 #debatenight
He would bring up the good ol' "Black on Black crime" debate...#debatenight
The gun epidemic is a plague that has increasingly affected millions; we continue losing our American values -- law and order. #debates
Stringing together a series of catch phrases and slapping an insult or two at the end is not a plan for our economic future.  #debates
Law &amp; Order is a great show dont drag it into your bs. And just once answer the damned question instead of using catch phrases #debatenight
Plundering a country for its natural resources during war is a war crime, you moron #debatenight
Honestly what does the #birthcertificate have to do with #debatenight Can we get to questions and answers that actually matter to voters?
"I have to respond" how many times will he say that while Lester is trying to move on? #debatenight
THEY PLANTED PEOPLE IN THE AUDIENCE REPEAT THEY HAVE PLANTED PEOPLE IN THE AUDIENCE #debatenight #debates
Sean Hannity sits by his phone, every day, waiting for US to call. #Debates2016
Hillary finally gets into the end zone with stabbing Trump on his architect. #Debates2016
Sean Hannity getting as much talk time as young black men being shot in the streets #DebateNight
Something so distasteful about the fact that Donald Trump constantly interrupts Hilary Clinton when she lets him speak #debatenight
"i have a winning temperament," and yet he still needs to interrupted her. While she remains calm and confident. #debatenight
Trump: I didn't pay any money to keep this country going. It's just Smart #debatenight
@realDonaldTrump "Lester, can you tell me what she said? I haven't been listening to a thing." #debatenight 😒
Donald when did @HillaryClinton say she DIDN'T want "law &amp; order"?  #Debates2016
Is he talking about his 10yr old being good with computers?How does that relate to securing America?Is he going to hire his son?#debatenight
If I was playing the #debatenight drinking game I'd have alcohol poisoning
It's just one of those things to get sued by the Justice Department according to Trump #debatenight
Think I'm going to punish myself and read some trump supporter tweets. #debatenight
When you've got a line as good as that "baited by a tweet" line, you repeat that line. #debatenight
Cyber war. "Damn hackers, I'd have gotten away with it without you meddling kids."  #debatenight  #scoobydo
say "inner cities" one more fuckin time you useless radioactive trashbag human #debatenight #debates #Debates2016
"I have a winning temperament! I know how to win!" Trump randomly talks about how great he is. 😂😂😂😂😭 #debatenight
"I think I did a great job of building up a relationship with the African American community in the last little while" -trump #Debates2016
Trump bringing back law and order &amp; stop-and-frisk scares the hell out of me.  #Debates2016 #CripTheVote
Well the topic is about race let's see if they address law enforcement 🍿#debatenight #debates
Donald trumps answers has only been about his investments, where we travelled to, Chinese ppl and etc #debates #Debates2016
"These countries aren't paying their fair share." -says the man who pays no federal income tax #DebateNight
Every time Hillary says ' the criminal justice system' in my head I hear the #LawAndOrderSVU chimes #Debates2016
Did Trump just low key blame Pres. Obama for the shootings in Chicago?? #DebateNight
Trump tries to say Obama caused all this violence but Hillary comes in with the statistics!! Boy!! #Debates
Trump: "The wealthy are gonna create tremendous jobs"   Tell me again how he's just like you and supports the little guy??   #debatenight
Is there a record for most lies in a single Trump sentence yet? Because that doozy about Iraq seemed like a potential winner. #debatenight
This could not even pass a high school debate standard. Trump's a kid ranting in the store coz his parents won't buy him choclates #debates
Who would have thought that Barron would get more shoutouts than Ivanka? #debates
Obama going to the golf course for the rest of his life. Nice. #debatenight
I can't wait to see what #Colbert has to say about this shit show tonight!  #debatenight
"How DARE Obama breathe! He could be fighting Isis in that crucial time!" - Donald #debatenight #debates
Pay your taxes @realDonaldTrump and we will get those great airports! Maybe we can throw in some new schools too. #Debates2016
Let me stop watching this before I get mad and move to Mexico FUCK @realDonaldTrump  #Debates
Respecting rights of minority communities? Maybe consider Muslim communities lose due process, civil rights w/no fly no buy? #debatenight
Is he saying "bigly" or "big league" because I seriously do not know. #debates
HOW TF DO YOU EXPECT TO FIX RACE RELATIONS BY BRINGING BACK A RACIST LAW?!?!?!?!?! #debatenight
Like he hasn't mad bad decisions??? Hello he went bankrupt in some of his complained. #debatenight
In His second greatest act of mercy, Jesus may well return before this debate is over. #debatenight
Trying to follow Trump is like reading a book with most of the words erased. #Debates2016
Donald Trump don't give a damn about black people or latinos. Not one ounce of fuck. He don't care about helping us AT ALL.   #DebateNight
By @realDonaldTrump's example, I am not pleased with my college education, so I can just not pay, right? #Debates2016
"When ISIS was a little infant..." 😂😂 I swear this man is comedian! #debatenight
I am looking forward to the "Shake It Off" Hillary memes tomorrow.  #debatenight
Why are they wasting time on where Barack Obama was born?  #Debates
Donald Trump speaks so loudly even when he is talking to the camera 😂 #debatenight
Can someone use this opportunity to tell @realDonaldTrump that not all blk ppl live in the ghetto? #Debates2016 #debatenight #debates
#debates #debatenight #Debates2016 Well, I am like possibly the only person trying to grasph everything they are sayin! I feel dumb :D
Trump is openly admitting he doesn't pay taxes and believes it's okay that  he doesn't #debatenight
I'm with a group of my friends, who happen to all be POC &amp; they are hurt &amp; embarrassed by the things Trump says about POC. #DebateNight
@FoxNews @realDonaldTrump  Problem is economic not race. Call Lyin Hillary out. #debatenight  #TrumpPence16  #TrumpTrain
this debate is hilarious but terrifying all at the same time #debatenight
Trump just wasted a big opportunity to push Clinton more on emails &amp; whiffed on it b/c Clinton implied he didn't make much money #Debates
Can I just go to bed and wake up in 2020? #Debates2016 #ImWithNeither
"i don't do any nasty commercials against you"  HOLY SHIT YES YOU FUCKING DO   #debatenight #Debates2016
I am the Audited Donald Trump, no lawyers can tame me! #debatenight
What are their views on the position of Tribune of the Plebians? #debatenight
10 minutes to go, it's the home stretch! Get your jokes in while they last! #debatenight
“The African-American community has been let down by our politicians.” - @realDonaldTrump #DebateNight
If you are too dangerous to fly, you are too dangerous to own a gun @HillaryClinton #debates
I hope everyone caught how Trump admitted to paying $0 in taxes and was proud of it #DebateNight
I'm actually laughing out loud at his better than Hillary temperament comments.   He's proven that's a total lie tonight.  #debates2016
#OHHillYes  #debatenight Why is Trump's lawyers advising him not to release his tax returns?
Now Hilary is telling us all that we should NOT disagree with her! What the Hell? She doesn't control our thoughts! #Debatenight #Debate
lol I have a son who is good with the computers #debatenight
Somewhere in a dive bar in New York, a grizzled Giuliani toasts the Don and screams, "See, at least someone gets it!" #debates2016
#debatenight hey morons every smart person that can afford an account takes advantage of tax laws. Even @HillaryClinton don't be stupid
wtf is Lester doing??? My nigga you not even controlling this damn debate ! Once ya time is up ! Its up!! Shut the fuck up! #debatenight
So... it turns out the hacker was @ChrisChristie. The #Trump said it first. He said it was a 400 pound man. #debatenight
Why does Lester even say "You have two minutes," but then gives him 10 to talk batshit nonsense? #Lester #debatenight #Trump #Clinton
you talk about the cops dying violently but it's the exact same way that black people are dying 😒😑 #debatenight
Should have tied the cyber security point to her emails ... instead called programmers fat #fail #debates #debatenight
There's a mental health problem on that stage with you, madam. #debatenight
He knows that she hasn't been president this whole time, right? #debatenight
"That is a mainstream media nonsense put out by her." I love his debate style. Trumping it all the way. #Debates2016
Both of you could be born by penguin midwives in antarctica, but what are you going to change?  #Debates
DRINKING GAME: Every time Trump says "Mexico" &amp; "ISIS" drink! Every time Hilary says "middle class" &amp; "tax" drink! #debates #Debates2016
The funny thing is Hillary is saying show us your tax returns but she won't show us the emails🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔  #Debates
#PresidentialDebate #Debates2016 Oh Sec. Clinton. Donald doesn't plan, he just files bankruptcy and walks away.
Audit. You keep saying that word. I do not think it means what you think it means.  #Debates
Why the fuck can't people realize that the economy is ALWAYS BETTER UNDER DEMOCRATS? #debatenight
"I know a lot of wealthy people" I get the impression the candidates on stage know no one but wealthy people #debatenight
The stupid facial expressions are starting and we are only 30 min in #debatenight
The prop bet for The over under on "China" and "endorsement" must have paid out by now. #debatenight
@LesterHoltNBC Thank u! Thank u for calling out Trump's racism! It was a disgrace. We are American.  We r better than that!!! #Debates2016
Hillarys defense mechanism is cracking jokes, bad jokes. It's getting pretty annoying. #debatenight
Trumped up trickle down... Soooo how exactly is her plan diff or were we supposed to find that in her State Dept emails? #debatenight
We just got a meme face from Trump everyone, I would say tonight is a victory. #debatenight
What's most important to Trump is his company, his family, and himself. What about the well-being of the American people? #Debates2016
Lester Holt is that substitute teacher that no one respects and the entire class low key forgets is there. #debatenight
#Debates2016 Isis started growing in the depths of all the prisons where we held prisoners of war.  Way before Obama. Evil breeds.
"I think implicit bias is a problem for everyone. Not just police." Preach it! #HillaryClinton #debatenight
You're stuttering Donald. I think you meant you were endorsed by ISIS. #debatenight
The moderator should have control of their mikes. When it's time for him to interrupt just shut their mikes off #debatenight
@realDonaldTrumpis avoiding the race question. Or maybe he doesn't understand it. Or just doesn't care.  🙄#debates2016
You don't waste your vote by voting 3rd party. You waste your vote by voting for a candidate you don't believe in. #debatenight
I can't believe so many people can watch the exact same #debates but yet just see one side or the other. Total opposites. #debatenight
Someone should tell trump that what he rambles about isn't important or true, he is a disgrace  #debates
Trump never knows what Hillary is saying and has to ask because he's always talking when he ought to be listening.  #debatenight
Whose pronunciation is worse, Donald Trump saying "Chicago" or Patrick Brown saying "Ontarians"?  #debatenight #onpoli
OMG he's watching shows and the lawyers support that and reading newspapers. #wtf #debatenight what is he talking about?
In donalds world. Blowing up a countries ships would not start a war. W.H.A.T. #debates
I'm sorry, Mr Chump...I missed the point of bringing up your son and his computers #Debates2016
I knew he wouldn't let the jab at his income go 😂😂👌 #debatenight
I just feel badly Hillary is debating this guy. She deserves a real debate. She's way smarter than this #debatenight
@debates shame on you. All legitimate options should be included in the debates. @GovGaryJohnson is on the ballot in all 50
If only @HillaryClinton cared this much about the murder of people she was responsible for when she was SoS.  #copolitics #Debates2016 #MAGA
I get the sense Hillary rehearsed everything in front of the mirror #debatenight #UNHvotes
Is it just me or are they both talking in circles? #DebateNight
Somebody get that man a bucket of water, he is HOT. #imwithher #debatenight
Maybe he's not as rich as he says he is, or maybe he's not as charitable as he says @HillaryClinton #debatenight
Trump on the reason why he would not pay people and companies: 'I take advantage of the laws of the nation' #Debates
Clinton: 'Yes, I prepared for this debate. I also prepared to become president.' #Debates
Clinton: 'We're working with NATO &amp; with our friends in Middle East. They can provide information to us. We can't alienate them.' #Debates
@Cernovich remember trump is a master strategist. There are 3 debates. Trump will save best for last. #debatenight
Is it December yet so we can stop listening to these 2 bumbling idiots. #debatenight #election2016
Yes, end private prisons on the state levels. End prisons period. Invest in programs that address root causes of crime. #debatenight
Trump, realizing that the not-releasing-tax-returns thing is a losing issue, is now pretending they don't matter. Sure, Jan. #debates
Will debate start a rush of Americans to Canada? They first will have to pass Kellie Leitch's Canadian Values test #debates #debates2016
#debates  google "redlining" and "blockbusting" -- stoking racial division is the foundation of the entire Trump empire.
Trump keeps sniffing. Did he do a line of Coke before coming on? Would explain his rants #Debates2016
Not to be ageist, but a septuagenarian talking about how cyber security is complex per what his ten year old can do #surreal #debatenight
Stern: "Do you support the Iraq War" Trump: "Yeah, I guess so" WHAT COULD BE MORE UNAMBIGUOUS #debatenight
Trump is treating the US like a business thing in which he will fail at. #Debates
I hope whoever the next moderator is is taking notes on how to shut Trump up because Lester is doing terribly. #debatenight
I love that watching political debates is now what I do for entertainment 👍🏻👌🏼
I think it's amazing how quickly the tone from both Clinton and Trump changed when the topic turned to race #debatenight
is Clinton going to mention her (and her husband's) involvement in the mass incarceration of black men?? #debatenight
If this was behind closed doors and Hillary was replaced with any leader of any country, I would fear for our country's safety #Debates
drink a beer every time Hillary says "drapes" Take a shot for every Donald "wrong"    #Debates
Trump: I was just endorsed by ICE. Also CocaCola and all cups, all parts of the great American beverage. I'm very proud of that  #Debates
@HillaryClinton staring at us through the camera as Trump claims he was against the war in Iraq is GOLD. #dontfightwithlester #debatenight
"Yeah, I guess so" in an interview with flippin' Howard Stern?? That's "support"? Come on! I don't like him, but that's not fair. #debates
Ever see a kid get caught in a lie and still try to talk their way out? Trump on the birther conspiracy #DebateNight #TrumpvClinton
Flashback: The Iraqi War. No wonder our gas prices remained in the higher $1's-lower $2's. #debates #TrumpClinton
I've zoned out during this #debatenight 32 times because I can't believe that it's real. I feel like I'm watching the Hunger Games
Stop trying to make braggadocious happen. It's not going to happen. #debatenight #PresidentialDebate #debate2016
I think Trump FAKE talk talk is a collection of 99 worst liars brought together in one casino. #Debates
"Illegal immigrants have guns and they shoot people." -Donald Trump   #debatenight
Is a psycho analyst out there? What gives with #DonaldTrump's freaky right hand movements? They get worse w level of agitation #debatenight
Hillary: we don't know what Donald owes but for sure he owes YOU THE TRUTH #debatenight
Somewhere along the line, Teleprompter Trump left the building. Bannon Trump now. #DebateNight
"Why won't he realize his tax returns?" Why did you delete your emails ? @HillaryClinton #debatenight
Hillary needs to up her game and get Trump properly on defensive &amp; lose his temper &amp; show his true crazy irrational colours #debates
If he was interrupting me like that I'd have to whoop his ass. You know her nerves are already bad. #debatenight
This debate is just a big, "I know you are, but what am I?" #debatenight
We've become a 3rd world country because of the shape of our airports?! Uhhh.... riiiiight. #debatenight
Watching #debatenight is like watching two spoiled whiny rich kids bicker about who's pony is better. I weep for this country.
Me six hours ago: "I'm so done with this election season"  Me now: *watching #debatenight in the lobby standing up and yelling*
That was close to a knock out punch by HRC when she said she stayed home to prepare for the debate and prepared to be President #debates
Yeah when the election is done the audit will magically be finished #debatenight
Lester Holt fact checks and Trump literally says, "No, you're wrong." Uh... #debatenight
Who needs a ride to the polls on Nov 8th? Because y'all..... #Debates2016
@realDonaldTrump can never explain how to bring back companies that left. Moderator better up his game #politiquero #filibusterPro #Debates
Watching #debatenight via .@scrowder's livestream and live commentary is probably the best thing to happen to presidential debates.
3000 shootings in Chicago?!? In 9 months?!? Where have I been? #DebateNight
Trump pushing for stop and frisk in a city reeling from a police corruption scandal. Okay. #Debates2016 #chicago
Okay, not a fan of LAX, but it's hardly a third world country. As if @realDonaldTrump would even have a clue. #debatenight
Trump draws laugh from the audience about his temperament being better than Clinton's. #debatenight #Debates2016 #debates
My blood pressure.  I can't.   Not one true word/fact/stat/thought and STOP SNIFFING! #debates2016
"That makes me smart" - @realDonaldTrump NOT investing in our nat'l security, transportation, education, etc. Sad! #Debates2016
Hillary: I made a mistake using a private email. Trump: That was not a mistake, that was done purposely. Staffers taking the 5th. #debates
How many people are about to google third world country airports so they can compare a picture to LAX #Debates2016
Whoever endorses him either got paid by him or are crazy fucks #debates
I wonder if her hand turned orange when she shook trumps hand  #Debates
I will never get over the fact that Trump has as many supporters as he does #debatenight
No one cares how rich you are @realDonaldTrump - we just want to know how much $ comes from Putin #Debates2016
isn't it funny how some people can yell without ever saying anything #debates
Can I just say that @HillaryClinton's resting bitch face when @realDonaldTrump speaks is #OnPoint #PresidentialDebate #debatenight #debates
#debatenight Trump talks so much about where he has property. Will he put this all in a blind trust if he is elected?
reminder that any analysis of Trump's success that doesn't contain the phrase "white supremacy" is inadequate #debatenight
Trump is being too polite. Hillary is talking over her time limit. #DebateNight Trump needs to make his points
Trump has lost it. Hillary the Lady in Red can just let him keep talking himself into a hole #debatenight #Hannity is now part of equation
I've only been watching for about 20 minutes, has he said "Yuge" yet? #debatenight #Yuge
#TRUMP SAID 104 Page  he is born on the 14th   #NUMEROLOGY #debatenight #TrumpTrain
wouldn't it be... such a shame... if trump were to drop dead right at this moment... #debatenight
You can tell that @BernieSanders has been in @HillaryClinton's ear and I love it. #debatenight
tbh i'm surprised donald knew that double of 2.5 trillion was 5 trillion #debatenight
I literally will never be intoxicated enough to listen to his voice for long periods of time, let alone 4 years. #H2K16 #debatenight
Does he realize that African American are literally violently assaulted at his own goddamn rallies?! #debatenight
Imagine you just found out it was Donald Trump you cybered in those chatrooms all those years ago #debatenight
ISIS has been around since 1970? Whoaaaa 7 presidents ignored them? #Debates2016
Was there a point of bring up the "Super Predator" comment? #debates #debatenight
He was actually speechless for a second at her saying "It was a mistake, and I take responsibility for it." #debatenight
The audience is cheering the fucking emails, are you kidding me? #debatenight
@DonaldTrump : I have a much better temperament than she does...strongest asset. 🙊#debatenight
Did he just say if you do a bad job you don't deserve to be paid #debatenight
Yes America. This kindergarten shouting/talking over each other match is called a Presidential Debate. #Debates2016
If you get audited every year, it's because your taxes are shady as fuck. #debatenight
No one calls Hannity because he's a bigger Dick than you are. #Debates2016
Can we get to education? Cuz edu in this country is so backwards theres little hope for our youngins..and im speaking from exp #Debates2016
"someone sitting on their bed that weighs 400 lbs" @realDonaldTrump just lost the obese hacker vote #debatenight
Hillary has the same look on her face right now that I have when That One Guy at work won't STFU. #debatenight
The fact that Trump compared himself to Reagan as if the Reagan years were great tho. Reaganomics anyone? #debates
Hey @HillaryClinton, just because you're a criminal doesn't mean you know how to fix the criminal justice system. #debates #debates2016
can we put a shock collar on trump so he shuts the fuck up during clinton's time? #debatenight
@RantingOwl Talking like a 4th grader goes over big with his base. #debatenight
Did @realDonaldTrump just imply that the rest of us are stupid for paying taxes? #Debates2016 #ReleaseTheReturns
Main screen nonsense media put up by her. Trump is mad a swear #debatenight
Ok well good bc the only credible source I was gonna ask q's to is Sean Hannity #debatenight
It could have been Russia, China, or someone 400lbs sitting on their bed! So Trump doesn't like people that weigh 400lbs also? #Debates2016
"Maybe he's not as rich as he say he is" - Hillary with this clap backs😂 #debatenight #debates
Firing on a foreign vessel won't start a war - Junior. #Lusitania #GulfofTonkin #debates
This has to be a parody hahahhahahaha. Donald Trump is arguing against fact. This is unreal. #Debates
HRC is skilled, well equipped with facts and the right information #debatenight #Debates2016
Maybe Trump thinks it's 1980. I know. With #TheAmericans on, things can be confusing... #debatenight
"It's all words, it's all sound bites." WTF! I can't believe what I'm watching. #debates #DebateNight
How fun would it be for Hillary to claim that a private email server was her way of avoiding a cyber attack? #Debates2016
I just wish we had @BernieSanders here instead of these 2!! No-one gets close to his economic plans!! #DebateNight #PresidentialDebate
Yes @HillaryClinton did support Iraq &amp; ISIS was created by Bush &amp; Blair.. #Debates2016
The moderator needs to get it together. Let me be the moderator. #debatenight
DID HE JUST BASICALLY SAY ITS BARACK OBAMA'S FAULT THAT BLACK MEN ARE GETTING KILLED? #debatenight
(3/4)#debatenight said you know, whether it was before or right after, trump was definitely -- if you read this article, there
Maybe you don't want to tell the people why you deleted your emails? @HillaryClinton #Debates2016
If your campaign is about your business, then I think we should talk about that...Yes...Take him down! #Hillary  #debatenight
#Debates TRUMP HAS TO ACCUSE EVERYBODY TO MAKE HIM LOOK GOOD.  HE THINKS WE ARE GOING TO BELIEVE HIS LIES  BIBLE SAYS SATAN IS THE ACCUSER!
#Debates BUSH INVADED &amp; UPSET MIDDLE EAST PEACE ELIMINATING SUNNI, VOTED OUT OF NEW IRAQI GOV,  ISIS FORM THEN.  LIE IS THAT IT WAS CLINTON
@LesterHoltNBC is going to need some aspirin by the end of the night. #debatenight #Debates2016
What the fuck does isis have to do with the fact that Trump tried to call Obama an immigrant #debatenight
I  will release my tax return when she releases all 33 emails #debatenight
If you don't do a good job, you don't get paid unless you fix your work @HillaryClinton #debate2016 #debatenight
Trump is literally the last person I would trust with my money. I would rather burn it. #debatenight #debates
Lester, better question: Trump, what is the current nuclear weapons policy in the USA? *crickets* #debatenight
JActs1631: JActs1631: JActs1631: JActs1631: #debatenight  Hillary is like an actress who has remembered her lines! Hillary does not speak f…
She was preparing by sitting on her ass?  At least Trump is working hard for votes.  #Debates
Oh but we can't bring up Chicago... that hurts liberals feelings. #Debates2016
Trump reality, "I want to get on to things that are very important to me." BTW, what's up with the Darth Vader breathing? #debatenight
Trump "bothered" by NATO countries not paying fair share...makes them good businessmen like a guy who doesn't pay taxes. Hmph. #debatenight
Businesses leaving the country is all he's said.  He's a businessman watching out for his own pockets. #Debates2016
@LesterHoltNBC needs to get his Hustle &amp; Flow on "I'm in charge" #Debates2016
I'm soooo done with hearing about her damn emails. Wrong? Yes. Careless? Yes. Criminal? Maybe. But I'm over it. #debates
Hillary should pray she doesnt have another seizure during tonights debate #debatenight
Trump logic is to name drop ISIS when he has nothing more to say #Debates2016 #debatenight
"We cannot just say 'law and order.' We need a plan." -@HillaryClinton #Debates2016
Trump site is down while Clinton's is still up and running. Shows exactly how strong she is. #debatenight #StrongerTogether #ImWithHer
Could Trump say the same thing about the emails that won't come out? #debates #The3300
She thinks she has this in the bag... I guess we'll see... #debates
320 million people narrowed it down to these 2????? Someone please wake me up already!!! #DebateNight #debates
Not sure how Trump is supposed to rule the country when he doesn't even know the rules of a debate?? #debatenight
He has a very boastful spirit. He brag on himself at every turn.  #debatenight
He argues they are all sound bites but talks about the 'greatest assists' on and on.And tremendous. Get some more words #Trump #Debates2016
Hillary - stop being reasonable calm and rational. It's way too presidential. #Debates2016
Donald Trump's attention span is like that of a child with ADHD. #debatenight
gangs ar not all illegal immigrants the dats shows this so Turmp has no validity #Debates
#debatenight why doesn't @HillaryClinton have an American Flag pin on...it's a little thing that says a lot.
Donald Trump has no fundamental understanding of liquidity and movement of money across borders. No understanding at all 😂😂😂 #debatenight
Item: DT stands for Donald Trump. It also stands for Delirium tremens (severe withdrawal signaled by shakes &amp; hallucinations) #debates
Am I the only one wishing @kanyewest decided to run this year? #debates
Man! And, to think, I wanted a third circus performer up there #debates
Lester Holt - great at chastising audiences, incapable of controlling candidates. #debatenight
Our airports aren't just from third world countries, Donald, they connect to most countries. #debatenight
Trump is digging a tunnel from the old Post Office on Pennsylvania Ave into the White House. #debatenight
Well that should be easy. "Let's take the guns away from the bad people who shouldn't have them." Thanks Don #debatenight
Not sure if I'm laughing because this is funny or to keep myself from crying #debatenight
Wait a second. Did Trump just wave his tiny orange finger at Hillary for saying a "terrible thing"? Hello pot, meet kettle. #debatenight
If you dream of being a millionaire, it'll happen. Just think that way, come on, that's why you're not already.... #debatenight
No, Mr. Trump. I will not and cannot believe you.  #debatenight
She's like, no, it's cool - hang yourself, you fucking creep. #debatenight
"The security aspect of cyber" - this is what having no clue what you're talking about sounds like. #debatenight
Are we TALKING ABOUT OBAMA'S BIRTH CERTIFICATE AGAIN?   Oh good, okay. That's what will gain my vote. 🤔🙄  Is he high? #debates #debatenight
Even if stop and frisk worked it (it doesn't)  is still no reason to violate people rights.  #debates
Anyone else have the Law and Order theme in their heads now? #Debates2016
He's hiding? What about those deleted emails. She owes us the truth !! #debates
ROAST HIM ON THE TAX RETURNS FUCKIN OWN HIS ORANGE ASS  #debatenight
RT Forbes: RT zogblog: You don't learn a lot from tax returns? As a Forbes writer, I disagree... #Debates2016
So $694 million dollars in income and how much in taxes were paid 🤔🤔🤔 #Debates2016
Somebody please call @seanhannity No one ever calls him! Please someone call him. #debatenight
Donald Trump loves talking about Donald Trump in the 3rd person like a true dictator #debatenight
#Trump isn't a complete idiot but he is rude and immature.Can't see him representing the USA. Dear G-d, don't let it happen! #debates #HRC
Trump ignored answering the racist issues between the Law vs African Americans. This dude is here smh #Debates2016
i'll listen to Trump talk about taxes when he starts paying his own &amp; brings his own money back into the states  #debatenight
When the IRS audits you, they present you with a letter saying that you're under audit. #Debates2016
We still talking about the birth certificate?! Like. Shut TF UP!!! #debatenight #Debates2016
If you are not doing anything tune in to #DebateNight it will be worth it.
@JulieDiCaro mind meld. I just tweeted:  I have a winning temperament says the man melting down #debatenight  #StopTrump #ImWithHer
Does Trump not consider himself a politician? What does he think he is doing up there? #debatenight
"I don't think General Douglas MacArthur would like that" why does that matter? #debatenight
No one has mentioned what will happen to the bat shit trigger happy police? Consequences? 🤔🤔🤔 #debatenight #BlackLivesMatter
Ohhh shit Trump just used a big word… his head is going to explode #debates2016
I'm retweeting myself every time I get angry about the 400lb comment. Screw that suited hairdo. #debatenight
"I don't like you," "Oh yeah?" "Yeah" "OH YEAH?" "Yeah..." "OH YEAH?!" "I said yeah...?" "OH YEAH, CLINTON?" "...yeah?" "OH YEAH?" #debates
I'll pray for United States, so that they can choose for what they think it's right and ok for their country #debatenight  🇺🇸
#debatenight and how many seconds will it take Trump to claim " the debate was rigged"? What an arse!
Trump's strategy: own up to everything - I did nag the president for his birth certificate! #debatenight
Dear @SpaceX if you're looking to test fire a live human into the sun I may be available in November #debatenight
Donald trump: "African America are.."  Me: #debatenight Lester: "This is Secretary Clinton's time to speak" Trump:
So you love Charlotte bc you have money here?! NIGGA I LIVE HERE!  AND I'M BLACK AND I PAY TAXES!! Fuck you Trump! #debatenight
unbelievable. Trump was a huge part of the problem in creating our economic crisis. puts full blame on Hillz's inaction. #debatenight
wait. Trump wants to "protect" black people? but... ban Muslim people? and deport immigrants? #debatenight
What will the final tally of interruptions be? Current must be Trump: ~15, Clinton: 0. #debatenight
don't have enough money for a Donald trump costume this Halloween? Try using a California raisin topped with a wild opossum #debates
"African Americans are dying in the strerts..." AT THE HANDS OF THE POLICE #debatenight
Hilary's teleprompter is now just feeding her System Of A Down lyrics  #debates
'Mass Effect 3 had a great ending. The best ending!' - Donald Trump, 2016 #debatenight
Has anyone made a Harambe joke about that 400 lbs comment yet?  #debatenight
I guess the drinking game is taking a shot every time Trump mentions he has property somewhere #debatenight #debates
Wait... Whoa whoa whoa HOW have you taken responsibility for your emails? 😂 #debatenight #CrookedHillary
"You've been in politics for 30 years" "You've been fighting ISIS all of your adult life" *looks up creation of ISIS* 17=30? #Debates2016
She admitted a mistake. He didn't know how to handle that. #Debates2016
"So it's negotiable?" Boom. Lester Holt for the win. I take back everything I have ever tweeted #debatenight #NeverTrump
Because people like it  RT @avada_kaydavra: Why is Trump such a giant asshole child? #debatenight
Trump started off strong but, typical male, finished way before she did  #debatenight
She just basically mentioned black on black crime though so I'm logged off. #DebateNight
I'm watching the #Debates2016 and #MNFootball on a split screen and I can tell the difference between Hillary and the Falcons.
.@realDonaldTrump The wealthy are going to create jobs. It's a great thing for middle class. #Debates2016 #debatenight
.@HillaryClinton It's a shame Donald paints such a bleak picture of the black community. Stop and frisk is unconstitutional. #Debates2016
We must use unconstitutional policy to violate the rights of people of color to protect people of color from themselves? WTAF? #debatenight
You can tell Hillary is thinking of a happy place where she's not debating a certified moron #debatenight
Hillary is giving Donald a vocab lesson #debatenight oh and she's mentioning the Iran quote.
"NATO doesn't pay their fair share" Ummm...doesn't that make them SMART, @realDonaldTrump? #debatenight
Lying ass lying. He will not release his taxes because it makes him smart????? Huh#debatenight
#DebateNight DT: law&amp;Order. Y'all Blacks need to killing each other. It's Obama's fault
@realDonaldTrump is that guy who keeps on texting you when you don't respond and leave your read receipts on #debatenight
"I also have a much bette temperament than (Clinton) does." - Trump #debatenight #Debates2016
He thinks stop &amp; frisk (racial profiling) will help racist driven killings that are happening? 🤔#debatenight
STOP &amp; FRISK IS FLAWED AS HELL AND DOES NOT ONLY TARGET "BAD PEOPLE" YOU ASSHOLE #Debates2016
You said something bad and took it back and now I'm going to throw it in your face. :-P #Debates2016
Hahahaha!!! @realDonaldTrump actually took his 2 min about her emails and instead defended his tax returns AGAIN. #debates2016
So Hillary tell us about all of the charity work you've done with YOUR Clinton Foundation. #debatenight
lol everyone I know from New York right now is up in arms because Trump just insulted our airports #debates
"Why not?" - Donald Trump's reason for blaming HRC for anything that's ever gone wrong. I'm sorry, is this real life? #debatenight
@karoneh he’s the president. He’s accountable.  That’s equality not a black factor.  #debatenight
"We have to know what we're doing."   Well, there it is.  Problem solved. #debatenight
Oh how quickly we forget you questioned Obama's birth certificate as well, don't we Hill? #debatenight
It's a shame the subject was race and he said he wanted to get to the border and things important to him... yikes #DebateNight
#DebateNight right now is better than the main event at Wrestlemania 6....and that's coming from me, a HUGE wrestling fan/nerd 🙃
Hillary smoking Trump. "I'm prepared to be President, and I think that's a good thing." #Debates2016
This went by to fast. Trump did not deny he does not pay federal income tax.#debatenight
@megynkelly why are you tweeting his lies? Is Fox News making you perpetuate these lies? #debatenight
The Iraqi's took all fondue weapons and cash and caved.  #debatenight
ISIS was not formed because of Iraq withdrawal! For the love of God! #debatenight
I want to throw everything I can reach at the TV when Trump speaks on foreign affairs. #infuriating #debatenight
I wonder how Marco Rubio feels about Trump's frequent water sips tonight? #debatenight
So trump being discriminatory towards African-Americans was "just one of those things"? #debatenight
This is going a lot better for Clinton than I expected. She's doing well with the meta-analytical, above-the-fray strategy. #debatenight
Is he for real? Does he really, truly know what he's saying? jfc #debatenight #debates
Why do trump and his supporters only care about Chicago when they are asked about violence perpetrated by police? 🤔 #debatenight
"I feel like at the end of this debate I'll be blamed for everything" "Why not?" MY GOD THAT BURN #debatenight
I can't wait to hear how Trump responds to the issue of race by telling us how "tremendous" his businesses are. #debatenight #Debates2016
Drink whenever Trump interrupts Clinton, talks over her, moderator doesn't tell him to put a cork in it. #debates
Actually Trump should stick to advertising for his hotels, a topic that at least he knows something about #debates
Sorry @realDonaldTrump but Tim Berners-Lee from England invented the web you muppet #debatenight
You guys, this might be the 100ML of Fireball in my system, but I really want to hug Hillary right now. #Debates2016
That must've been a very quick 2 minutes by Trumps watch. #debates
A typical confused high schooler trying to convince  the class to accept his wrong desputable answer #debatenight #Debate2016
Her husband started the incarcerationof blacks under his tenure   #debates
"They would have won on appeal" from the great legal mind of Sir Donald Trump #debates
I literally forgot that Trump is a real person like how does someone evolve to be such an evil person??? #DebateNight
Ok. I've watched. Learned nothing new. I'm going to YouTube cat vids. It'll be more enlightening than this shit. #Debates2016 #We'reDoomed
Americans don't want to play the blame game, they want solutions. Stop with the finger pointing! #debatenight
Trump attacking obese people addicted to the Internet is a bad move. That is literally his base. #DebateNight
If we don't get at least one shot of Lester Holt looking at the camera like he's on the office, I'm gonna be devastated. #debatenight
Uhhh, There's no law against releasing tax returns while under audit... #debatenight #Trump
Undecided voters should have a good look at Trump. Who would you like to fight for you as President. #debatenight
Fact: undocumented people commit crimes at lower rates than general public #factsmatter #debatenight
I like hearing plans, get these military style guns off the streets! #debatenight
Can Hillary stop talking about her fact checkers and her books? #Debates
@realDonaldTrump just said he "took advantage" of laws to benefit himself and his family. Nothing for working families. #Debates @SEIU.
So better relationships would come from stop and frisk? Doesn't make any sense #Debates
If #Trump managed to avoid paying any taxes, he's a great businessman. Who doesn't try to lessen the burden? #debatenight
Solid attack. The parade of tradespeople is good personal politics. Makes him look petty. #debatenight
😂 It's like #Trump has been told he has to look like he has the right temperament, so rather than show it, he just yelled it out #debates
You both are spewing nonsense. Holy crap, elementary kids could do a better job then you clowns #Debates
Hillary knows how to give someone credit when quoting their speech. #debatenight
really? he should have produced his birth certificate and you can't release your taxes? REALLY? #debatenight
Anyone have a count on the amount of times Trump has told us his business is very successful? #Debates2016
#debates shouldn't the fact checking be conducted by a 3rd party. Not Hillarys site
That smile on Hillary's face is her getting ready to put the hurt on him for the tax return thing. #debatenight
That smile on @HillaryClinton's face whn Donald talks brings me so much joy. You can feel her gettin ready to put the hurt on. #debatenight
Did he just say that he has a better temperament that @HillaryClinton? Am I dreaming? #debatenight
You get audited because your business practices are shady and likely illegal #Debates
You settle a lawsuit so you don't have to admit guilt.. #Debates
Is this the first time Howard Stern was mentioned in a presidential debate? #Debates2016
Saying you're endorsed by ICE is like saying you're endorsed by Darth Vader. Just saying. #debates
The IRS has stated that an audit would not prevent Trump from releasing his tax returns. #Debates
I swear to god, if you replaced Donald Trump with Andrew Dice Clay, no one would notice. #Debates
Through the entire section on race issues... did either candidate mention #BlackLivesMatter? #Debates
Hillary calls Black youth "super-predators", but wants to call Trump the racist. Alright Hil #debatenight
The only way to prevent it is to let the #NSA take over our lives. Uh, no. #debatenight
This is a train wreck. Isn't a moderator supposed to moderate? "Nah, I'll just let Donald shout over her and over me. No biggie"#debatenight
Yes, Hillary. Answer the question, name systemic racism, &amp; show Trump how to press into an issue instead of dancing around it! #debatenight
Hilary should get an acting award for just dealing with this debate. #debatenight
Again, we live in 2016, mute a candidate when they interrupt. This isn't middle school. #mutethemicrophone #debatenight #Debates
Dog law and order is all we have and it's been doing us WRONG. #debatenight
"We're in a big fat ugly bubble." Does the misogyny ever stop, Donald? #debatenight
One candidate seems rattled and a little unhinged. Hint: It's not the one wearing a red pant suit. #Election2016 #debatenight
Does anybody care about Trump or his success in business??? Seriously??🙄  #debatenight #debates #ImWithHer
"I take advantage of the laws of the nation" ...oh my lord, why would i want you MAKING the laws??? #debatenight
He sounds like he's never read a book that didn't have pictures. #Debates
I hate to agree with @realDonaldTrump but he wasn't wrong about Laguardia Airport..... #debatenight
Trump supporters: Trump is killing her.  Hillary supporters: He's a joke, not even close.   Can we get a damn points system?   #Debates2016
"charlotte - a city where i have investments..." would trump care if he didn't have financial stake? #Debates
I just fix a Bologna sandwich to go with this circus on tv. What lies I missed while in the kitchen? #debatenight
Hillary: "He would rather not have this debate/I’ll remind you that he is NOT Secretary of State" #debatenight
It's actually insulting that @HillaryClinton has to be on the same stage with such an inarticulate, angry person. #debatenight
Why does Trump have so many lawsuits and why does he settle so many? He is a crook that is why. #Debates
Yes, Trump know abt poor treatment of African-Americans in the city 1st hand because he refused to rent apartments to them. #debates
I can barely even remember what trump is saying. All he's doing yelling and rambling meanwhile Hillary is offering real plans #debatenight
Ugh, I'm just disgusted. This is what we have to look forward to. #DebateNight
Is he eyeing for a cabinet post now..what's with all the agreeing???#debatenight
He keeps interrupting and acting so childish. This is crazy, I'm waiting for the cat fight to happen.. #debatenight
Trump losing the 400 pound hacker vote with that comment.  Not a smart move.  #debatenight
#Trump BLEW opening to point out how well #Hillary knows cyber security by using unsecure systems for classified information. #debatenight
"Everyone should be respected by the law, and everyone should respect the law." - @HillaryClinton #debatenight
If you need me, I'll be reciting Hamilton lyrics to remind myself that at one time America was worse off #trump #debatenight
I wish debates had a trial by combat option. While I'm wishing, I also want a dragon. #debatenight
I have spent almost 40 minutes on #Debates2016 and I have learned NOTHING! Wake up America. They don't care about us. They're all for them!
@YNB @puppymnkey This man is not only a disgrace to the Presidential race but to the human race #debatenight
@HillaryClinton  Did your IT guy do a good job? Did he get paid for deleting those emails on your private server? #debatenight
"Nobody calls Sean Hannity." I hear nobody answers his Evites either. #debatenight
"A city I love, I city where I have investments" that about sums it up #debates
Yes Hillary "I think implicit bias is a problem for everyone, not just police" #DebateNight
@realDonaldTrump I'm pretty sure, #BillClinton was part of the crime bill of 1994! #debatenight
You're running for president but you just admitted to not paying taxes....HOW ARE PEOPLE EVEN GIVING HIM THE TIME OF DAY #Debates2016
Airports?  You are going off at the mouth Donald, you fell into the trap #debates
What are the odds that it turns out they're just two sets of three kids in overcoats? #debatenight
I believe the phrase you're looking for, #LesterHolt, is "SHUT THE FUCK UP FOR A MOTHERFUCKING SECOND, DONALD TRUMP" #debatenight
For real after being asked if she had an answer about the emails Hillary should have just said no I'm done w/that subject. #debatenight
If I drank every time Trump says China, I'd be dead. #debatenight
Sorry #Trump, my law degree and years as a lawyer trumps your stupidity all day, everyday, Sunday's included. #Debates2016
I'm hiding under my table until we know whether its America or Donald Trump that's about to blow itself up #kthxbye #debates
I didn't support the Iraq war, just ask SEAN HANNITY! Haaaaa! #debatenight
Trump claims he has a better temperament than Clinton and the crowd laughs. #debatenight
Lester Holt has way more truth to speak on blackness than either of these two. Difficult to watch him interrupt a black man. #Debates2016
It's something to b watching this debate knowing these ppl r our only choices for the next Potus #debatenight
You said number 2 twice. I wanna know what medicine you take. #debatenight
@HillaryClinton needs to stop smiling no matter how much she wants to laugh at this ass clown. She will seem arrogant. #debatenight
#debatenight "if ur to dangerous to fly ur to dangerous to buy" @HillaryClinton
Hilary is at least courteous, he makes her look like a candidate and him like a joke #Debates2016 #debatenight
I'll release them as soon as the audit is complete; I've been audited for 15 years straight.   So never...   #debatenight
So Obama's birth Certificate is more important than Criminal Justice Reform and Climate Change? Where are the tough questions? #Debates2016
I'm surprised it took this long to mention the emails to be honest #Debates
Bill #Clinton 's administration saw the best years in the last 30 for #AfricanAmerican  families.  I looked it up. Hill&amp;Bill #debatenight
#debatenight Trump: "The african American community has been so badly treated." By you.
The only one who interrupted @realDonaldTrump during his "time to speak" at #debatenight was @LesterHoltNBC 😂😂😂
#debatenight  Seriously, I've been waiting for that "last little while" comment all night.
Lol @realDonaldTrump has been audited for the pass 15 years which means they won't be released  🤔#Debates2016
This wig wearing Cheeto is calling for more law and order. Just let Giuliani scream his face off for this part my dude. #Debates2016
Of course he knows what Russia is up to. He and Putin are bros.#Debates2016
Quick, let's turn to the world's foremost experts on internet security, Sick Hillary and Tronald Dump #debatenight
What's harder to watch: #Debates2016 or the 9th inning of the @BlueJays game?
Looks like a vote for the lesser of two evils for our neighbours to the south.  #Debates
I'm just hearing @JimCarrey doing the Star Trek duel theme he did in The Cable Guy. #debatenight
#Debates she can lecture about transparency.... we've gotta deal with childishness 😑 and somebody that can show their taxes just as much
#Debates He can't even formulate a proper sentence 😂😂😂 " was " you mean " were "
Not Trump is debating Lester Holt. What say you, @SeanHannity? He says you were for the war and he was against. #DebateNight
Where is the automatic mic shut off when the candidate's allotted time is up? #Debates2016
I would love for Trump to just answer a question directly instead of dancing around it!! #Debates2016
Alright Trump, you just have to survive another 15 minutes and we still haven't learned anything about your "plans" #debates
trump: "typical politician... all talk, nothing [good] will happen"  sounds like he's describing himself #debatenight
#debates the wealthy will create jobs...taxes don't allow them to bring jobs back to the US. Q2: How do you defend your plan for tax cuts?
Trump sounds like a guy on COPS caught smoking crack explaining how he's never smoked crack. #Debates2016
#debates Trump: "It's all words, it's all soundbites" *Proceeds to spurt out nothing but words and soundbites*
#debates This is longer than 20 seconds. SOMEONE CUT HIS FUCKING MICROPHONE!
#Debates All these sniffles, clearly he has Pneumonia and by the current rules that means he can't be president... that's how it works right
#debates Dude it's not a mainstream media attack, we have audio! WE HAVE FUCKING AUDIO!
Trump supported Iraq war.  Denied climate change.  Lies about everything and anything.  #Debates2016 #debates #NeverTrump #DonTheCon
How odd is it that @GovGaryJohnson wasn't allowed to appear in his best 90-minute campaign commercial? #LetGaryDebate #Debates2016
"We have to cyber better." A conversation I haven't had since AIM #debatenight

Did Hillary just say she wanted to squeeze ISIS! Wow I feel so much safer now! #debates
Nuclear codes. Does she know how many people are involved when it comes to even consider going nuclear? #Debates2016
Trump is already near the White House. His hotel just opened. #debates
Can we just discuss, briefly, the contextual differences in HRC's responses and Trump's responses? #debatenight
@debates nonpartisan? Is that why @GovGaryJohnson is there? Oh right owned by Republican and Democratic parties #LetGaryDebate
Trump: I will release my tax returns -- against my lawyer's wishes -- when she releases the missing 30,000 emails. #debatenight

It's like watching a toddler lose it in a toy store. Only one adult onstage but we're all uncomfortable #ClearOutTheClownCar #Debates2016
He's a perfect case study for any psychology or counseling course! #DebateNight #SnifflesIsMad👺👌🏽
Lester how are you cool as a cucumber letting them talk about POC like this? I couldn't be a reporter. #debatenight
How is Trump going to fix the deficit or pay for his plans if you make huge tax breaks?  #debatenight
Hillary has a weak footing on race, yet Trump is unqualified to call her out on it. #debatenight
Holt: Stop &amp; Frisk was ruled unconstitutional because it unfairly targeted black -- Trump: You're wrong. Oy vey.   #debates
This guy has used the pronoun "I" about a thousand times tonight. Does he give a shit about anyone else? #Debates2016
Is this guy really talking about airports?  learn more about Romney's tax return than I did of the emails the FBI has released. #debatenight
Bill gonna want to beat Donald's ass by the end of these debates
Racism? So many people did it! And I didn't apologize! So, I'm tremendously successful #Debates2016
Again race baiting by moderator. NOT a major topic for debate. ONLY to give @HillaryClinton talkingnpoints. #debatenight #Debates2016
Trump said he hasn't paid taxes because it would be squandered?  Really?  #debatenight
I'm going to start saying "wrong" to all fact based statements  #debatenight
Um, did Hillary get into Iraq? Did he forget that Hillary wasn't president in '03 #debatenight #cansomeonefactcheck?
If you could stop naming your endorsements and start stating your policies..that would be great #debatenight
@realDonaldTrump don't you fucking dare take the name of Law and Order in vain. #Debates2016

However, can we just take a moment for the fact that it apprears @realDonaldTrump attempted to style his toupee #debatenight #StillNeedsWork
The bubble popped after Bush's second term Donald. You should know, considering you made money off it #itscalledbusiness #DebateNight
I don’t think we’ll be seeing another debate for this presidential election. Drink it in, people. This is it. #debatenight
Ooh, we're back to the audit excuse.  And then he starts blathering about something that has nothing to do with the question. #debates
Tha Donald just profiled a hypothetical person.. THEY are bad people, THEY have guns... who is THEY fool? #Debates2016 #ImWithHer
I wish Bernie was up on that debate stage right now 😭 #Debates2016
Clinton just said exactly what I was thinking.. "you cannot just say law &amp; order, you have to actually have a plan" #debates
I want them to talk about college (if they haven't already, I missed some) #debatenight
I've heard more eloquent debates from 7 yr olds in my classroom....😒

Is Trump saying his 10 year old son is a cyber security expert?  #debates
Well, it's true that a lot about his business IS unbelievable... #debatenight

THE EMAIL CARD HAS BEEN PLAYED. I REPEAT, THE EMAIL CARD HAS BEEN PLAYED #debatenight
The question is how you are going to address HOMEGROWN terrorists, Donald ---&gt; still waiting for the answer #debatenight
This is the most disrespectful thing I've seen an adult do. #debatenight
Well apparently Hillary has been fighting the Islamic state for 30 years now. Where's the congressional hearing in that?#debatenight
She couldn't even hold it that time! I don't blame her one bit. #Debates2016

I wish the #debates didn't make me want to throw up but they do
I've walked down many streets in "African-American" neighborhoods without getting shot. #debatenight @realDonaldTrump

Standby for about 50 references to China. Get the drinks ready guys #debatenight
Donald #nofactstrump  #debatenight  back at it again with those white lies! I'm going to the basement and I'm bringing a rope and a stool.
did trump literally just admit that he hasn't paid his income tax? "well it would be squandered" #Debates2016
Trump is handing her these fallacious arguments on a silver platter, and she's not doing much with them. #debatenight
Justice? No. Addressing issues? No. Law and order and law and order and law and order and law... #debates
Yes, limit guns from the law abiding citizens. Criminals always get guns legally. #Debates2016
Notice he's wearing a blue tie and she's wearing red? Did they do that on purpose? #debatenight
He’s your President too, you unconscionable imbecile! I don’t care how much we disagree, he’s OUR President. #debates #debatenight
Clinton likes rhetorics and wants to look herself holy. Donald Trump didn't support the Iraqi invasion and even Libya.#debatenight #debates
I am in awe of @HillaryClinton for keeping her composure so beautifully as @realDonaldTrump spews garbage. #debatenight #debates2016
WTF does any of this have to do with the current question?  He is derailing the fucking debate!  #debatenight
How does Trump know so much about Russia's nukes? What did Putin tell him? #debatenight
He gets audited because he's a TAX FRAUD and a CROOK #debatenight
The oil belongs to Iraq not just  there for the taking. #debatenight
weird that trump and clinton aren't debating the real issues like harambes death #debatenight
Does Hilary really wanna go there with "What is he hiding?"  I love the Clintons. There are loads of skeletons in closets. #Debates2016
Trump is looking for the fastest way to get himself more money. his real concern is the coins. #debatenight
I think @NicoleCarrWSB and @LDENBERG are doing a bigly job live tweeting the debates
Enough with the emails. Where are the 22 million that Bush deleted about WMDs? #debates
"It's really unfortunate that you continually paint such a bad picture of the black community, Donald." #debates
Trump does know that W and the republicans got us "in" the war....right? #imwithher #debatenight
I haven't given much thought to NATO but I clearly know everything about them #debatenight
@BRios82 Is he?  I bet his fans still think he's winning.  They're the ones we need to worry about. #debatenight
Hahahahaha he actually admitted the IRS finds him suspicious. And that his lawyers don't want him to! #suspicious #debatenight
What 10 year old isn't good with computers?! You're a dumb fuck #debatenight
"...he's never paid any federal income tax."  "That makes me smart." omg #debatenight
Trump has asked me to go down to the Federal Elections to learn more about him  Where can I find the federal elections #debatenight
The Donald is arguing that stop and frisk is not racial profiling. OMG #debates2016
#debatenight Trump, running the country is NOT all about you and your family.  It's about what is best for our country and its citizens.
Question was about cyber-security. She's giving a stilted answer on ISIS when she should be hitting him on Russia ties. #DebateNight
Was Hilary given the questions pre-debate?? She literally looks down every 2 seconds. #debatenight
That email release line just got Trump some votes, Stein and Johnson voters. #debatenight #Debates2016
Catch up @DonaldTrump we don't use the term "third world country" it's "developing nation" #debatenight #ImWithHer
When you run the country you can't just file for bankruptcy whenever you fuck up. #debatenight
"I was a bit racist when I was young but, everyone was, and I settled without guilt, so now I get to be old &amp; rich &amp; racist." #debatenight
Of course @realDonaldTrump cares about you. If he's got property where you live! #debatenight #Debates2016
#debatenight  Can we talk policy now, Lester?  Trump drowns the most when he tries to act smarter than he is.

When trump is talking, Hillary's expression just says, "I am about to roast this mans life away." #debatenight
I still have yet to hear any kind of plan other than it's clintons fault #Debates
It seems like @realDonaldTrump just regurgitate what @HillaryClinton says..like his wife @MELANIATRUMP did with what @FLOTUS said. #debates
Just shut up all right all ready, trump! Wait for your turn.  #debatenight
our airports are like a 3rd world country? THE FUCK? DID I JUST HEAR HIM CORRECTLY? #DebateNight
Stop trying to make "stop and frisk" happen. It's not going to happen!! #DebateNight #DumpTrump 🙅🏽
Or maybe technology is evolving? And cyber hacking wasn't a big deal under Bush? #Debates2016
He literally can't give HRC 2 minutes without interrupting her....but, no, he has a great temperament! #debatenight #debates
Oooooohhhhh! Maybe he's not as rich as he says he is. #thatMakesMeSmart and #AmericansAreDumb #Debates2016 #debates

Ok Donald Trump knows that you can't actually just "take all the oil", right? It's liquidy, and mostly in the ground? #debatenight
#Trump tente une pique sur la santé de #Clinton : "I went all over the place. You decided to stay home and it's ok." #debatenight
Does Trump seem defensive? He's seems defensive. Definitely defensive-- welcome to the big leagues, buddy-- #debatenight #PresidentialDebate
Wiping away tears while watching the #Debates2016 both from laughing and crying.
"Could be someone sitting on their bed who weighs 400lbs"  DAMMIT DONALD I HAD ONLY 2 SLICES OF THAT BANANA BREAD 😡  #debatenight
Trump blames Hillary for all of  the problems in the Middle East even though they're rooted in an agreement from 1916 #debatenight
So... if I'm hearing this correctly, Trump is comparing running this country to a on schedule construction project? #debatenight
@HillaryClinton could've won this debate right now if she had said "He can't have his tiny fingers near the button." #debates
oh, look: @HillaryClinton sounding all sober &amp; informed while addressing racism and injustice. amazing that this race is close #debatenight
#debatenight "I prepared to be President, and I think that's a good thing!" #ImWithHer

Where is Joe Wilson when we need someone to yell " YOU LIE" #Debates2016 #MakeDonaldDrumpfAgain

Trump on his shady tax dealings: “That makes me smart.” That makes you a crook! #bloatedbully #debatenight #idiocracy
Donald learned a new word tonight #braggadocious #dumpthetrumpamerica guys a loose cannon  #debatenight
Political debates only help solidify bias. They do nothing to change anyones mind.

#debates Hillary saying she wants everyone held accountable for breaking law... Except her
She is doing a great job! "I have prepared to become a President."#HillaryClinton #debatenight

Trump is hiding. Why won’t he release his tax returns? He’s a coward. #debatenight
"We can't just say 'law and order.' We have to have a plan." #debates
Can't believe he's doing this badly!  Should have prepared don the con #DebateNight

u can look at trump interrupting 2 ways: 1) he's being an asshole or 2) he's that strong voice that this country needs.... #debatenight
"No discrimination against african americans or mooslims but..."  No, go ahead, we'll wait. #debates
Hillary Clinton is formally referred to as Secretary Clinton. Donald Trump is just... Donald. #debates
Donald debating is like a 4th grader trying to debate at this level #debatenight
I'm sorry... did Donald Trump say that based on our airports we've become a third world country???? #Debates2016

OMG Trump just groaned at the mention of good things happening in black communities. #debatenight
He just told y'all he doesn't pay taxes. And, y'all wanna vote for him. #debatenight
Donald Trump makes fun of women disabled war heroes. 2night saying someone of 400 lbs may be responsible 4 hacking  computers #debatenight
Listening carefully to what the candidates have to say. Who can we trust? #DebateNight #DonaldTrump #HillaryClinton #Election2016 @FoxNews
the amount of talking over each other going on in the #debates reminds me of my parents fighting through my entire childhood #triggered
Mr. Trump, what should we do to heal racial relations? "First, Hillary is wrong" "we need law and order" "I agree with Hillary" #Debates2016
What did China really do to Trump lol he acts like he fell asleep around China one day and woke up with a carrot up his ass #debatenight
Sincerely, before this first debate I supported Clinton. Now, I'm very confused. #debatenight
Wait what's that over over there....oh it's nothing, I just didn't have the answer #debatenight
Can someone make a loop of Trump saying "McClatchey," please? That was interesting. #Debates2016
"We don't know whether it was Russia or China or a 400 pound guy sitting at home that hacked the DNC" #debates WTF?!?
Obama is "your President" too, Trump. Unless you're a Russian citizen already? #debatenight
Clinton seemingly not turning her back on a post-Brexit Britain - 'we need to vacuum up knowledge' #debatenight
#debatenight #taxes Don't care about your income @realDonaldTrump. What about your donations and tax rate?
Can we count how many times he's said Isis without addressing Isis? #DebateNight
He never talks about the issue He tells a life story that IDGAF about "Nukes? One time I was nuking popcorn and god himself..." #debatenight
"That makes me smart" because why should the want to be President pay taxes like the rest of us? #debatenight
Haven't seen it like this the last couple election debates.  WELP~
No one takes job recommendations from applicant's friends. Why should I listen to Trumps friends? #Debates2016
Twitter making me rage at how onesided it is, figures though considering most celebs are on here and all celebs are democrat 😤 #Debates2016
"I yelled into a bucket alone in my bedroom late at night denouncing the war" Trump. #debatenight
Hillary's expression reminds me of my tv debate w/ Kris Kobach Like... #WtfIsHeTalkingabout #ICan'tBelieveThisIsReal #debatenight
"I have a much better temperament better than she does... my most winning asset" OMFG #debatenight
"I love Charlotte. I have money there."  WHEW. OK, guys. Racial divide has been solved. All good now.   #debatenight
He just yells thing that have no basis in reality. You know @HillaryClinton is amazing because she's not visibly frustrated. #debatenight
Couldn't stomach #debatenight but loving twitter collectively fact checking in real time.
"Cyber warefare will be one of the biggest challenges... unless you use BleachBit like me, in which case--worked like a charm." #debatenight
I'm going to need for you to calm the fuck down with all of this yelling @realDonaldTrump #debatenight
The only reason to bring up a lockbox in this debate is if we are discussing Donald Trump’s tax returns. #Debates2016 #DebateNight
I am enjoying twitter and debate at the same time #debatenight  #debate
The question was how do you close the racial divide @realDonaldTrump? Didn't hear an answer in there. #debatenight
Trump knows he doesn't have to use 140 characters or less, right? Full sentences. They're your friend. #debatenight
You can tell the anticipation for this #debatenight on #11alive has been a long time coming. Tension. People on edge watching live.
"We need Law &amp; Order."  I agree, Donald. @Mariska is QUEEN. #Debates
The split-screen is nice and all but CNN's gotta mix up the camera angles a little bit. Starting to get a little nauseating. #DebateNight
Lester could throw out a random topic like thoughts on low sugar oreos and Trump would yell incoherently about it. #Debates2016
It's good to see how Trump has become a politician by spinning question into non-answers. HRC would be proud. #Debates2016
Fact check in real time!  Trump is such a liar, being caught on live TV at that. #debatenight
I don't care who you like, this may be the most epic debate ever #debatenight
Airports?! We are a mess because we have old airports? What is happening?! #ImWithHer #debatenight
"Wrong" is Donald Trump's "Winning" and I'm already sick of it. #debatenight

it's really sad we need a fact check to verify what our presidential candidates are saying is true... #debatenight
'I know a lot of wealthy people' which has nothing to damn do with damn running for damn @POTUS #Debates2016 #ImWithHer
@realDonaldTrump You really called the USA a Third World Country! #debatenight  Way to win our hearts.... not....😒@AdamParkhomenko
The volume of instant fact checks is brilliant. Candidates should have a feed and explain their mistruths #debatenight
At least @realDonaldTrump acknowledged the thousands he's stiffed, with a nice nod. #Debatenight
I should have dressed as Trump for 80s day during homecoming. There was a lot of &lt;sniffsniff&gt; blow back then, too. Fucktard. #debatenight
Trump: "It's all words. It's all sound bites." That about sums up the campaign. #debates
Trump once again touting controversial stop and frisk policy, which has disproportionately impacted African Americans. #debates
We all knew the debate was going to be trash, but the moderator is just being walked over #debatenight
I will release my tax returns when #HillaryClinton releases her deleted emails - #DonaldTrump #EmElect #debatenight
#Hillary takes on #DonaldTrump's failed businesses. I'm glad my late father didn't do business with you, says Clinton. #DebateNight #EmElect

"I have a much better temperament than she [Hilary] does." THE BIGGEST LIE OF THE YEAR GOES TO........ #debatenight
Wow! @realDonaldTrump "I have a better temperament than Sen Clinton". Someone please give me the new definition of Temperament  #debatenight
Having lots of money doesn't mean you're good at handling it. #debates
All while mentioning his businesses in Charlotte of course. Making the recent tragedies about him instead of the oppressed... #debatenight
"I said... Idk... Maybe... Who knows?" You expect to be president but you can't even remember what you said?! #debatenight
#Debates Notice Hillary reading from teleprompter?  Following  script provided to her!  watch her look down for answers!  LOL! Watch eyes!
Burn Notice guy with mustache is giving me first dead guy vibes. #debatenight #SicarioOnAmazon

#debatenight  conflict of interest trump is promoting his business trump hotel in dc on national tv
Trump &amp; Hilary are the definition of the product of their environment.1 is a bully/humorous racist &amp; the other is a liar/fraud #Debates 🕴🇺🇸💃
Advice to all politicians: don't use the phrase "these/you people." Thank me later, smh #debatenight
Stop and Frisk has been proven to be problematic.  Stats have proven it targets primarily LAW ABIDING black &amp; brown people. #Debates
@realDonaldTrump getting desperate now. His voice is shaking and rising. Donald's same speech. #Debates2016 #debatenight
So Donald Trump #sniffles is psychological warfare--he's clearly doing it on purpose to gross us all out so we stop watching. #debates
Trump talking about cyber is like me talking about it in the 90s when it meant chat sex #Debates2016
the way trump finds the way to spin the question around to the point of not even answering it at all is so appalling #debates
I bet the only part of Yemen Trump knows about is 15  Yemen Road, Yemen #debates
Obama ain't even "black". Raised in Hawaii, nothing but a "white bred" world. Never met a black until 29 and in Chicago. #debatenight
If it's illegal to wanna punch Hillary Clinton in her face, I'm gonna be arrested. #debatenight
"Everybody refuses to call Sean Hannity" is the only true thing Trump has said. #debatenight
Time out !!! We need a time out ... Clinton needs some oxygen lmaoo #debatenight #MAGA
Palm Beach is the wealthiest community in the world? Where did you get that fact @realDonaldTrump? #Debates2016 #DebateNight
WOW! Trump just said he wouldn't take off Nuclear Weapon use off the table. Oh my god. #DebateNight
Keys to the #Debates2016 1. Time of Possession 2. Turnover ratio 3. Third-down conversions 4. Scoring in the Red Zone
We should have the right to bear arms, and be stopped and frisked for them! #debates #TrumpHarambe2016
We will bring jobs back to all Americans, even and especially Mooslim-Americans. #Debates #TrumpHarambe2016
#Debates2016 Makes me wonder if there really are that many racist white ppl out there to make this guy the republican candidate.
@HillaryClinton talking about solutions &amp; problems - #mentalhealth #guns @realDonaldTrump talking about endorsements &amp; ego #debatenight
#debatenight Hey @realDonaldTrump trolls if this is the level of intellectual ability you have, fuck it! The bums always lose.
Trump: "Hillary wants to take your guns"  Also Trump: "We need to take guns from these people who shouldn't have them" #Debates #Debates2016
@LesterHoltNBC ask Donald if he will move his companies to start producing in the US. #Debates2016 #donaldlies #holdhimaccountable
#debatenight Trump claims maybe workers don't do a good job. Where is the apology? Trump has no answer.
#debatenight Trump - a clown face with no emotion. He is not prepared - having a hard time following the debate substance.
#debatenight Birth Certificate produced but Trump kept bringing up after - avoided answering questions - deflecting.
#debatenight Trump has a cavalier attitude towards nuclear war - the problem
Someone get The Donald a nasal breathing strip! Vicks! A neti pot! #ImWithHer #debatenight
"I made a mistake using a private e-mail... I'm not gonna make any excuses, I take responsibility." #Trump, #debatenight.
Donald I like you but please don't say she says horrible things. You do too. But she DOES horrible things. Attack that.  #Debates
Can't 4give Bill 4 Somolia. Can't 4give Hillary 4 Benghazi. #debatenight  If ya haven't served, ya may not care
I just keep yelling OOOH MYYYY GOOOOD over and over at my TV #debatenight
I don't think he gets that taking advantage of faulty laws is still a bad thing. #debates
As a #military #veteran &amp; spouse of a #vet, @realDonaldTrump is a draft dodger not fit to be #CommanderInChief PERIOD Debates2016 #ImWithHer
#debates I will release my tax return if you will release your 33,000 emails.
How much of that $694M would it cost to buy a new toupe? @realDonaldTrump #debatenight #Debates2016
L O FUCKING L @HillaryClinton's temperament is one to be concerned about? Says the rude, narcissistic, interrupting, asshole.  #debatenight
I will reiterate, the Adam Berkey Political Power Hours was brought to you by the debates via @cspan! Thank you @cspan.
Oh, got it. Of course. That makes sense. No First Use. #debatenight
I don't want to know what your business is doing right now Donald... I want to know why you want to run my country! #debatenight
What freaking world does Donald Trump live in??? He's friggin delusional... #Debates2016
If someone kept saying "that I can tell you" to me, I would scream. #socondescending #debatenight
Does Trump think Clinton was the Sec. Of State for 30 years or something.....? #debatenight
he won't show his tax returns, but who is he wearing? #DebateNight
Trump had barely made it through 45-minutes of debate. He isn't gonna be able to handle 2 more. #DebateNight
Saying what we want to hear instead of how you truly feel. Your words off stage say different. #debatenight
Trump keeps bringing irrelevant "facts" into the debate. And sniffles. Lots of sniffles. #Debates
Be mad at the government (that Hills been in for 30 yrs) that made the corporate tax breaks possible.  #debatenight
"I think Donald just criticized me for preparing for this debate." -@HillaryClinton #HilYES #ImWithHer #debatenight
Y'all I had no idea that there was no law against ppl on the terrorist watch list buying guns..... What... #debatenight
Donald says the same words in one sentence: Jobs, Hilliary, jobs. Hillary, etc. #debatenight
He spins stories but can't answer a direct question.....now he has amnesia! Can this moderator man up??? #debatenight #StopTheTrumpTrain
Trump must be dehydrated because he taking down that water like it's vodka while Clinton haven't taken a sip💦 #debatenight
Must be hard for Donald to apply ointment to all Hillary's burns o him while he eats shit directly out of Holt's asshole. #debates
"I have property" or "I have investments" doesn't mean you should have the presidency.  #debatenight
The whole crowd started laughing when this man said he has a better temperament 😂😂😂 @realDonaldTrump go home Bruh #debatenight
When is Lester gonna tell that eejit to stop talking over people!! #debatenight
This man Trump is really crazy. How did we get here? HOW? #debatenight
"Wrong" x2 - Trump That was uncomfortable and childish to watch. Body language is a big factor in this. #honors2120 #debatenight
When Donald loses the election, he's going to claim that he didn't care about the presidency anyway.  #debatenight
TRUMP IS TRYING TO START A WAR BETWEEN THE WALL STREET JOURNAL AND THE NEW YORK TIME #Debates2016
"I have the endorsement of the police." Yeah, that's not something to brag about. #debatenight
Why's it so hard to just say "Yes, implicit bias is a problem within America's police force"? #debatenight
The expression on Hilary's face as Donald tries to talk over Lester #debatenight
"Big fat ugly bubble." @realDonaldTrump uses up an insult he was saving for a woman. #debatenight #Debates2016
Pretty safe to say Trump would be happy with any endorsement #debatenight
"I haven't given a lot of thought to NATO, and I think that's why what I'm about to say is going to make sense" #debates
Hillary thinks wealthy Americans should pay their fare share Why shouldn't European states pay their fair share? #debates #DebateNight
Trump has to fight off the urge to make faces and constant interruptions while Clinton is speaking. #debatenight
It's #debatenight and I'm debating... should I rush A or B? :P #CSGO
"The record shows that I'm right." - every emotional woman who is wrong in a fight #Debates2016
Where does Bush(Republican) get some blame on Isis, Osama, War, Hussein, (WMD's)??? #debatenight #NeverTrump
Idk what Trump is talking about. I've been on the East Side of Lubbock. I'm less afraid there than I am in a frat house. #debatenight
"Because some of them have a lot of money outside of this country" lol like you? #debates
#debatenight  myb Donald doesn't show commercials with Hillary but whenever he tweets he does always get offensive n call her crooked
@HillaryClinton reminds Donald he's just given example of "Bait &amp; switch" in regards to his tax returns. Has he had to pay taxes? #debates
At this point, I'm so embarrassed that this is being broadcast as a debate.   And yes, most of us are implicitly racist. #debatenight
Drumpf is under audit every year! He needs to fire his accountants. #debatenight #Debates2016
.@HillaryClinton giving a lesson in what being presidential looks like right now. Compare that to whatever Trump just did. #debatenight
Trump:I'll just say words all jumbled together.It doesn't matter if I answer any questions.I'll just say those words loudly. #debatenight
I love the dead stare Clinton is giving the camera as Lester is growing a pair and challenging Trump. #debatenight #Debates2016 #debates
Trump, you DO learn a lot from tax returns when you actually look at them. #DebateNight #ImWithHer
Nobody cares about your "great" company trump, we care about the progress of our nation #DebateNight #ImWithHer
Turned off the debate to go to a comedy show and feel like never laughing again! #debatenight
Donald Trump is the biggest eye roll of the entire CENTURY!! He is this generation's equivalent of Hitler ! #debates
"I have a feeling by the end of this evening, I'm going to be blamed for everything"---. @HillaryClinton  #debatenight #FCNdebate
Let this sink in....you've probably paid more federal taxes than Trump in the past 5 years..... #debatenight
If you can't watch the debate this morning, the crux of every @HillaryClinton answer was been "the government will fix it" #debatenight
Hillary is absolutely ailing this segment on racism &amp; gun control. #Debates2016
I always picture @realDonaldTrump supporters as being like the Meth Heads on "Orange is the New Black" #debatenight
HAHAHA "I prepared for this debate, and I also prepared to be president" BURN!!! #debatenight
"Do you believe police are implicitly biased?" [tactful sidestep] "I think many of us are implicitly biased" #debatenight
Both edu references so far tonight have to do with $$$ #debatenight #HofDebate16 #ewadebate
Trump did well to control himself and act presidential for, what, 10 minutes? Now he's back to his true self. #debates
I would say that Clinton is winning, but does it count as a win if your opponent self-immolates? #debates
Oh damn... Sidney Blumenthal being thrown under the bus. Sorry Sidney Blumenthal whoever you are. #debatenight
Rogue traders at the BBC must be eyeing up @realDonaldTrump for an episode #PresidentialDebate #debatenight
How do you judge "bad people" in the terms of stop &amp; frisk other than race?! #debatenight
"Maybe he didn't do a good job" YOU STILL HAVE TO PAY SOMEONE. IF YOU DIDN'T LIKE IT WHY IS IT IN USE.  #debatenight
LESTER IS THE REAL WINNER OF THIS NIGHT. Dateline NBC ➡️ #Debates2016 ➡️ Someone get this man an Emmy
Hillary can only laugh it off because it is so true, she cannot control her temper! #Debates
"You have two minutes Mr.Trump" *says everything but answers the question* #debatenight
Did Trump just take credit for Obama being born in our country? Wow. #Debates2016
Lester Holt isn't even trying to stop this shit show from falling off the rails. CHINA CHINA ISIS CHINA #Debates
I do not want a president that settles things with no admission of guilt #DebateNight #debates
Not paying your taxes does not make you smart. It makes you a schmuck. #DebateNight #releaseyourtaxreturns #yourethecrook
#debatenight: #Trump is just rumbling is way through that thing, no plan... AMAZING!!!
Ice...is.. he was just endorsed my isis... thats what I heard #debatenight
A pause, he still didn't answer why he kept pressing about it #debatenight
I'm waiting for her to talk about his clothes made EVERYWHERE BUT the U.S.A. (China, Mexico) #debatenight #OneVote
#debatenight these two shouldn't be allowed to even take a tour of the white house
Ok Donald, what we NOT gonna do is disrespect my president. Barack will dog tf outta you. #debatenight
@biancashurn Bush created ISIS by taking out Sadam Hussein. We never should have been in Iraq. #debatenight
#debates Racism is a problem, so why is Trump standing there? The biggest racist I've ever seen (and I live in Russia, mind you)
I think for #Trump the end justify the means, so what if im not doing something, its working, im making money, who cares #debatenight
donald trump just showed the world he's an a-hole. this isn't new information.  #debatenight
I'm pretty sure trump doesn't know shit about the African American community. #boybye ✌🏾️ #Debates2016
IRS: Trump can release financial information even though he is being audited #RooRxN #Debates2016
I will release my tax returns after she releases her 33,000 emails 😂😂😂😂😂 #debatenight
@realDonaldTrump is defending his personal wealth. Kellyanne Conway is having a coronary somewhere #debatenight
How how is this man even here...how can the first woman candidate be treated this way....#debatenight
when hillary speaks it feels like i have my brain back #Debates
Can someone tell Trump there's new episode of Law and Order available on Hulu? #OliviaBenson #LawAndOrderMarathons #debatenight
Honestly I think they should just make the moderators microphone 10% louder to stop all this shouting from @realDonaldTrump #debatenight
Prediction: Trump will do all he can to not participate in future debates. He knows his ass is kicked. Serious dry mouth. #Debates2016
Why does Trump keep saying "Barack Obama and Sec Clinton"? Does PRESIDENT Obama not deserve as much respect? #debatenight
Trump loves him some Trump. Pats himself on the back with every opportunity #debatenight
#debatenight Are you serious Clinton?  You don't think black communities are in dire need of help?
So far we found out he won't pay his workers if he doesn't feel like it and he doesn't pay federal taxes. #NoTrump #debatenight
Lester, just tell trump to shut the fuck up during Hillary's time. #Debates2016
i just want to congrats hillary clinton's body double on doing a great job tonight #debatenight
Know Trump hates this debate, having to listen to a woman and being interrupted by a black man. #debatenight
Donald Trump looking like Jose Mourinho trying to defend his 2nd season in charge of Chelsea... Foolish. #soccerdebate #debatenight #debates
She just supported Stop and frisk lowkey...Hilary and her contradictions. Smh. #Debates2016
Ok, I don't want to sound pedantic but someone needs to explain hyperbole to the Donald #debatenight
Just because you don't admit guilt doesn't mean you're not guilty. #debatenight
Trump appears to be looking into the crowd for hand signals or cue cards for leads on topics and stats. #Debates #debatenight #Debates2016
So Trump confirms he CAN release his tax returns whenever he wants. #Debates
Guys, Trump did an interview with Howard Stern! ! take him seriously! #debates2016 #PresidentialDebate2016
"Squandered $6T!" "Maybe [the debt] is because you won't pay your taxes."  "It would've been squandered, too." #TaxationIsTheft #debatenight
@realDonaldTrump : We have a trade deficit with the countries we do business with of over 800 billion per year. #debatenight @nbstv
Trump to Hillary: You decided to stay home and that's ok. #debatenight
Hillary is doing a Muhammed Ali job tonight!  Wham, pow, punch!  #Debates2016 #debatenight #Debate
ZING!  Hillary tells Trump she prepared to be president and that is a good thing!  #Debates2016 #debatenight #Debate
Trump is on defensive, running scared.  Word Salad.  #Debates2016 #debatenight #Debate  But #SheWon
Donald Trump Makes Me Nervous But What The Hell Is He Looking At #debatenight
Yes it's unfair . But wtf are you going to do about the racial divide? Take guns out of the hands of the bad people.. umm alright #debates
We have ugly airports. That makes us a third world country. Thats offensive to actual third world countries. #debates
donald saying "wrong" is the annoying know it all kid in class  quizzing you with flash cards #debatenight
Donald Trump may say racist things, but he will atleast make important changes to America unlike Hillary. #Debates
"Really important" okay Hillary you know what else is really important? FUCKING CLASSIFIED INFORMATION #Debates2016
Everyone shut up I want to hear these white people talk about race! #debates
Let's watch two white people talk about race and attempt to not be awkward about it. #debatenight
@OBAMA_CZAR It's total and utter hypocrisy. You can tell that she is struggling to stay above water. #debates #MAGA
How ya even store 30k emails. They probably self deleated she was jamming up the server #debates
Lester Holt is making James Comey look like an honest broker #debatenight
Did Hillary just say everyone is implicitly biased. As in racist? Come on man #debatenight
Trump: "I have much better judgement than she does, also a much better temperament." Clinton: *audibly giggles* #debatenight
It was a republican decision to go to war that has yet to end and now a democratic decision to continue #Debates2016 #debatenight
Our airports are like a 3rd world country? When the FUCK was the last time this orange piece of shit flown commercial? #DEBATES2016
Trump:"we need to restore law and order" but I'm not going to tell u how we're going to do that or a plan to achieve that #Debates2016
I think it's incredible that he interrupts himself w himself. He can't get full statement out hes too busy cutting himself off #Debates2016
Hillary was absolute class while Trump spoke. Now she's speaking, and he's huffing and puffing and making faces. Real professional. #debates
Law&amp;order isn't the issue it's some of the ppl who feels like the uniform that they wear gives them the authority to abuse it #debatenight
Why did he just point at her? She's the only other person on the stage. #Debates2016
"(He) accused me of preparing for these debates.I did.I did. You know what else I've prepared for? Being president of the United States."
HOW IS THIS MAN EFFECTIVELY TIED WITH HER IN THE POLES!!!!  AAAAAAAAARGHHHHHH... #Debates
Trump has spent about half the debate whining that "no one calls Sean Hannity." #debatenight #Debates2016
Doesn't he have a @PlanetSunTans appointment to get to? Did he run out of Sun In? Can someone change his diaper? #debates
Oh god here we go 🙄 #debatenight #debates the #racecard huh 😐 Let's here this
Stop and frisk is effective? Where the fuck at!!!?! But only Black and Spanish people are stopped and frisked🤔 #debatenight #debates
ok trump.......but what about those people you didn't pay? you gon ever address the topic?? #debatenight
Just like how you threaten to have Hillary killed twice was not a mistake! #debatenight
His obligation is for his family and his companies. He didn't say his obligation is to America. #debatenight #debates #Debates2016
"I have a winning temperament. I am a winner." Ha ha! #debatenight
If @realDonaldTrump cared about African Americans/Latino Americans he wouldnt support discriminatory policing like stop/frisk #debatenight
Trump is so transparent and real in what he's about that I kinda respect the guy.  Would I want him to be my president? No. #debatenight
#Clinton is coming across as very relaxed and natural. Trump is getting riled up and she is keeping her cool. #debatenight
Trump's only relations to these cities being mentioned are the properties he owns. #Debates2016
Hillary: So I think that.. Trump: Why isn't hillary's grandson fighting ISIS? Because she's not a good candidate! #DebateNight
Hillary's emails = Trump's taxes in my opinion. Both have something to hide from the American people #debatenight
The bully Trump showed up.  The heavy breathing, lying loud Trump showed up,  Hillary is confident and cool. #debatenight #Debates2016
honestly feel like trump searched up all this info a day before the debate thinking it's gonna make him look better #Debates
Trump is running for president but did not list his country as an obligation🤔🤔🤔🤔#debatenight
Hell yea! "I prepared to become President"! I love her! ❤️💙😍 #Hillary2016   #debatenight  @HillaryClinton @TheDemocrats
Hillarys fact checking is a MSM backfire. Why? Because Media fact checkers are corrupt and supporters of Hillary. #Debates2016
(1/2)#debatenight Hillary clinton: he actually advocated for the actions we took in lib wra libya and urged qaddafi be taken out
"The nasty commercials you do on me that I don't do on you -- maybe I'm trying to save the money" #Debates2016 #Trump
These two need to talk about real shit and stop clowning around #debatenight #debates
WHO ASIDE FROM TRUMO CARES ABOUT OBAMA'S BIRTH CERTIFICATE????????????   #debatenight
Amazed at how much she can recite about his tax returns in previous years...but doesn't know what that small "c" means? #debates
Let me guess, the two of them agreed on Trump's bullying tactic. They are having fun fooling the American ppl #debatenight #debates2016
Trying to watch the #Debates2016 but can someone tell @realDonaldTrump to stop sucking in air through his nose so loud! 👃🏻💨
Trump: African American community has been let down by politicians, have been used &amp; abused by Democrat politicians.  #Cato2016 #Debates2016
Why isn't @LesterHoltNBC asking about Wasserman and VOTER FRAUD? You know journalist being NEUTRAL and all @realDonaldTrump #debatenight
I wonder if #HillaryClinton's far more numerous attacks will be as successful. #debatenight #Debates2016
@iinnddiiaa_a said if Donald Trump become President she moving to Canada 😂😂💀 #debatenight
So, we all know this debate is kinda boring and substance free thus far, right? #debatenight
My thumbs are starting to cramp with all this fact checking. #debatenight
"I think I have created great relationships over the last.... Little while... With the African American community" - Drumpf #debatenight
Donald trumps place is not beside Hillary clinton on the debate night he should be in a psycho center!! #debatenight
A NYPD officer just tweeted that murders are down in NYC so you are wrong Trump. As usual. #debatenight
stop &amp; frisk minorities while white men on wall street  robbed america blind #debatenight
Good lord. There isn't enough alcohol is this world. This is really what we have to choose from????? — watching Presidential Debates 2016
"Why not?" "Yeah, why not?" AAAAAH I AM LOVING THIS. Damn, Hillary, I am loving this. #debatenight
HOLY SH*T DAAAAAAAAMN HILLARY. It's like 10 degrees colder in this shade.  #debatenight
In other words: I won't release his tax returns because he's hiding something, obviously. #debatenight
Did he seriously just say "That makes me smart." when it comes to paying Federal taxes? #debatenight
"AfricanAmercansHispanics are in a living hell"  Who, now?   #debates
Trump will not accept a single piece of criticism.  Anything that is said to him is "Wrong".  #debatenight
Gun epidemic? Roving gangs of diseases firearms plague our inner cities. We have a violence epidemic in the hearts of ppl #debatenight
At this point I'm building a self sustaining cabin in the middle of the woods with a 30 food wall around it. #debatenight #Debates2016
Hillary really wants to cough right now, you can see it in her face. #debatenight
Trump not paying taxes is what his tax cuts are all about keep the money #debates2016
Trump basically described himself as civil rights leader for LETTING Blacks &amp; Muslims ENTER his Palm Beach club. What!? #Debates #ImWithHer
You don't learn anything from tax returns. But you said just the opposite of that at the start of your rant on it #debatenight
After Trump repeats himself the 3rd time he stops making sense. He can't articulate an idea or make sense. Unintelligible #debates
Trump: *whiney child voice* "well if I have to be exposed then why can't she"  because it isn't relevant to the question #debatenight
@justinvansant this has turned into 2 candidates kicking over each other's sand castles. #Debates2016
FFS. No fly list has no criteria!!!  WHY would Trump support that?!? #Debates2016
#DEBATENIGHT Experiment: Go to HRCs website see if you can find out your tax rate, then go to Donald's, and find your tax rate.
Soooooo not only are you smart for not paying taxes BUT you don't pay employees at the end of a job? And that's good business? 🤔 #debates
They both sucks God protect America. I will not vote for neither! !! #Debates
Looks like @realDonaldTrump's Xanax is wearing off #TrumpUnhinged #ramblingTrump somehow knew it wouldn't take long #debatenight
so “good business” is profit through collapse of others &amp; avoiding taxes? #debatenight #PresidentialDebate
Watching #debates with 14yr olds: @HillaryClinton : you can't just say 'law &amp; order' @realDonaldTrump : law&amp;order law&amp;order law&amp;order law&amp;or
Take a shot every time Trump says "China". Die from alcohol poisoning. #debates
The only thing missing in this debate.... The real issues. All I hear is shade.  #debatenight
I mean I know he said he didn't prepare, but didn't they at least discuss how bad it looks when he interrupts? #debatenight
I agree with the parts you liked of that. And believe me, it would be beautiful.  #Debates2016
African Americans &amp; Hispanics being incarcerated is your husband's fault HRC. He was the one who pushed for mandatory minimums #debatenight
#feminist Clinton wants to remind you what a great president her husband was. REMEMBER? #debatenight
Lester Holt, thanks for sucking so bad.  You have extraordinary responsibility here.  SPEAK THE FUCKING HELL UP.  #debatenight
"Take the guns away from the bad guys" real innovate approach, Trump. #debatenight
She says one murder is too many but how many people did she murder in Benghazi? Oh yeah. More than one. #debatenight
#Debates2016 NAFTA did not cause the huge job losses feared by the critics
"It would be squandered too" re: fed taxes. Wait wait wait are you saying you haven't in fact paid those taxes? Can we rewind? #debatenight
I think Trump just said the @NRA are very good people and now I'm not sure if I need my hearing checked #debatenight
Wtf does defeating Isis have anything to do with a birth certificate #debatenight
1 nice thing I can about Hillary is her Botox is ON-point! Her forehead has 0️⃣ lines &amp;never moves,not even when debating Trump #Debates2016
Clinton says the email server was a mistake, then drops the issue #DebateNight
Clinton bringing up Russian cyber attacks and Trump's ties to the country #DebateNight
someone who is 400 lbs who cant get out of bed  hacked , Hillary guys  #debatenight
Who's this ISIS candidate??? Probably better than Clinton or Trump though. #Debates2016
If you have to tell me you have common sense, well... #debatenight
Where do the Candidates stand on whether @WuTangClan is or is not something to fuck with? @RZA #debatenight
Trump: "We are in a big, fat, ugly bubble...This Janet Yellen of the Fed..." #debatenight
Donald Trump just let out a debate sigh that would put Al Gore to shame. #Debates2016
When politicians talk to you like you're a seven year old. #debatenight
I will miss Barack Obama so much. Can he just appear and give debates and speeches instead? How the mighty have fallen
Trump started by saying he was going to release whn the audit was over. Ended by saying he'd release it when blah blah emails #debatenight
Hillary is making Trump look weak. His strongman/StrongBad impersonation is the best thing he's got going for him. #debatenight
Dear Trump, I don't give two shits about your hotel in DC. Stop marketing and give me one piece of policy #debatenight
Clinton advocates the revocation of constitutional rights based on inclusion on a secret list. #debatenight
You bitching about getting audited when your friends do is complaining you child in a big leather suit #debatenight
@nbc4i is Hillary releasing Foundation donations and contributions ? Transcripts of wall St speeches ? #Debates2016
He sure is acting out!  A spoil brat  who could possibly consider him 4 POTUS? U must keep ur posture never let them see u sweat #debates
Is Taylor Swift gonna pop out from behind a podium &amp; mic drop this thing with "Shake It Off" or is that not a thing at #debatenight?
Just tuned in. What in the fuck is Trump talking about? #Debates
This is such a joke without @GovGaryJohnson . Without a third party this is just a dog and pony show #Debates2016
Watching #Trump is like an episode of "Kids say the darnedest things" but the kid is orange and a pathological liar. #debatenight
Hillary is a politician, but the other one which shall not be named is a mf CROOK!! #PresidentialDebate #Debates2016
Trump giving numbers and having one memorable sentence is clever, but it's easy to tell Hillary's answer is much better thought out #debates
Am I missing the part where he actually answers a direct question? #debatenight
#ObamaBirthCertificate shows that #Trump has no concept of time or he has a time machine.  #debatenight
Ease off a lil Don, you can destroy her without interrupting as much- allow her to tie her own noose first, THEN push #debatenight #debates
If Trump can get the original "Law &amp; Order" back on TV, I could be swayed. Important issues #debatenight
If I was never going to vote for Hillary, then my vote isn't taking a vote away from her either way. #HeyJill #debatenight
Lester Holt framed the knife attack at the mall as a "terrorist attack". The law enforcement community, no connection.#debates #Debates2016
Same thing Rahul said in 2014 general election and He got only 44 seats.  #debatenight  #Debates2016  @priyankac19
"EVEN in my party people want to give people on watch lists some rights". #wowproudofyou #debates2016 #debatenight
@realDonaldTrump weren't you friends with the Clintons before you decided to be a Republican and run for president   #debates
Ok so he brought it back to Benghazi which may have been a good move because...yeah #debatenight
Trump ramping up the dog-whistles and ignoring the unconstitutionality of stop and frisk #debatenight
Black ppl did not need or want u to get #PresidentObama's birth certificate! Don't try to put that on us. #trumpedup #debates #debatenight
#DebateNight Not paying taxes does not make you smart it makes you a criminal
Hey! The IRS says @realDonaldTrump being under audit IS NO REASON to not release taxes. #Debates2016
Hilliarys had 35 years and has done nothing for this country.....vote trump #Debates
#debatenight When @HillaryClinton gives facts, Donald nods his head like 'oh good point, wish I would have said that'
My Mama: "He just keeps going on and on and on! #Speak up!" #Hillary2016 #debatenight
The real question here is: Can Trump let Clinton talk without interrupting? #debatenight
Donald trump is a crook that doesn't pays his debts what type of a men don't pay his bills  #debatenight
#debatenight that makes me smart being a billionaire and pay no federal income taxes #realdonaldtrump
Hillary wants to raise taxes on the wealthy but if you do that it'll just hurt our economy because of the class system set up#debatenight
I find it hard to take Hillary serious when she talks about cyber security. But she still sounds better &amp; more factual. #debatenight
The Clinton Foundation only spends 5.7% of its budget on charity, the rest of it is used as a slush fund for Crooked Hillary #debatenight
He just wants more enforcement - that is not working it's just getting people killed - you need to build community #Debates
#debates Hillary calling Trump a racist...refuses to accept the fact she racially campaigned against Obama in 2008 - her hypocrisy exposed.
Trump said he has been under audit for 15 years; so, what are you hiding?? American voters deserve to see!!! #Debates2016
If you don't want to get hacked then maybe don't use gmail you damn chili pepper lookin ass #debatenight
Just once I'd like to watch a debate where I don't feel severe secondhand embarrassment and anxiety #debatenight
Clinton has given up trying to smile through Trump's, well, Trumpiness. More genuine. Let's see not-having-it Hillary. #debatenight
Laugh Out Loud. Oh My God!  His strongest asset is his temperament? We are in trouble. #Donaldsworld #debates
Trump is right about US having 3rd world or worse infrastructure. But that is @GOP policy #debatenight
#debatenight "Too many young african american and latino men ended up in jail"...because of Bill's "welfare reform" policies. What's new?
Trump ridiculing 400-pound people?  Isn't that his main group of supporters, fat rednecks? Bad move, bro... #debatenight
Why doesn't Trump address the issue that our own citizens are being killed unlawfully #Debates
Hey @LesterHoltNBC Who's running the show? Are you in line for the next season of The Apprentice 2? #debatenight
This debate tilted me so hard I just closed my laptop  I need a drink #debatenight
Thank God for @HillaryClinton, oh she is so sane, cool, calm and collected. Courteous, and well composed.God be with you #debatenight
#Trump to #Hillary: “That’s why you’ve been fighting ISIS your entire adult life!” #debatenight heats up.
"I haven't thought much about NATO" motherfucker, you haven't thought much about anything. #debatenight
Omg I feel sorry for this man. This is embarrassing. He's so far out of his league. #debatenight
Can I use these "fact checkers" on my math test tomorrow sounds like it would help me a lot #debatenight
Does he realize that "cyber" is not typically used as a noun? #debates
Not proud to have moved to a city that's become a talking point in @realDonaldTrump's campaign. #chicagostrong #prayforchicago #debatenight
When trump has a better make up artist than Clinton  #Debates
Why watch the #debates when you can watch the #Reds demolish the Cardinals. 10-0 Top 4 #LetsGoReds
Lester: actually that's profiling.  Trump: no, hush. You don't know what you're talking about.  #debatenight
@realDonaldTrump Now you can release your taxes if HRC releases emails, but you just said you can't b/c of audit. Which is it?#debatenight
Oh man, Trump's blood is up, the constant interruptions is pure rude Trump #debatenight
Get this lying scumbag @HillaryClinton His taxes prove he is not a billionaire, has Russian and China ties and no charitable giving #Debates
"I have given lots of thought to NATO." This is demonstrably false. #debatenight
"These are very good people and they're protecting the Second Amendment"  ...no matter how many die! Dedication! #Debates2016
Trump: I was endorsed by ICE Daenerys Targaryen: Dracarys Trump: * Melts * #debatenight #GameofThrones #myimaginarydebate
They need to give him a time out with his blankie.  #debatenight
#Trump says he'll release his tax returns when #Clinton releases her emails.  #debates2016
Also- I'm now reminded about this Stephen Colbert quote, "*asking Trump* how does Vladimir's dick taste?" #DebateNight
why the fuck is he bragging about allowing anyone of any race into his clubs lol they should always be allowed anywhere #debatenight
You know he wrote that joke weeks ago and paused for laughter #debatenight
Heavily Demilitarize the police state. And allow citizens to be armed, lessen gun control. #debatenight
I really don't understand how conservatives are voting Trump... he literally said he supported the police state lmao #debatenight
You can get to Pennsylvania Avenue on a tour bus. Or uber. #debatenight
BOOM!  Trump talking about the HIGH COST of govt. inefficiency - unskilled politicians wasting our CASH.  #debates  #Debates2016
How do you have a better temperament than her? You fuss about everything and she has kept her cool this whole time 😑😑😑😑 #debates
So I get that all politicians avoid answering questions, but Trump isn't event trying to be low key about it. #Debates2016 #debatenight
I want to go for a run but it's way too MF hot outside still! 😩 #damnyoudrought #DebateNight #runitoutTrump #stahhhp #educateyourself
#Debatenight #Debate2016 #debates Because politicians have been giving all communities the means to grow and thrive? #debatesarcasm
When Trump said, "I say nothing" that's the most honest answer he ever said. #debatenight
"These are very good people" how many times has Trump said this? #debatenight
I think I'm gonna drop out of school, eat food in bed all day, and just hack the DNC. That would be so much fun. #debatenight
If #Sniff was on your #debatenight drinking game please stop playing now. I don't want anyone to die tonight.
Why she keeps laughing at a serious debate is beyond me. Xanax induced #debatenight
W/ all these issues of candidates talking over each other, I wish there was a way-a button maybe-to mute 1 speaker at a time. #Debates2016
Clinton was there with her husband when he got us out of debt. Maybe #trump forgot that #debatenight
Trump just took a BIG swig on that race question! Does he know he has a 70 y/o prostate and an hour left with NO breaks? #Debates2016
Donald  how will u help low income family's  #debatenight twitter
Hillary plugging her book and Trump plugging his new DC hotel 😂😂😂 #Debates2016
Go after ISIS online? What are we gonna do, makes memes about them until they quit Twitter like the Cincinnati Zoo? 😂 #debatenight
@realDonaldTrump speaks gibberish but @HillaryClinton does herself no favors with her smug condescension &amp; canned insults #debates
.@HillaryClinton: 'just listen to what you heard' in response to @realDonaldTrump Obama birth certificate answer  #debatenight
@realDonaldTrump is NOT hitting @HillaryClinton with specifics as he could! No mention of her scandals or fraud or LIES! #debatenight
Much better temperment?  Trump makes Nixon look "hella chill".  #Debates
I'd be a good prez b/c I own a nightclub where diverse people come to. OMG. 🙊🙈🙉 #DebateNight #diversity ?
#Debates Bath house Barry was born in Kenya his relatives even said he was are they liars?
#Debates jesse Jackson has never said he was a racist in his videos in the 90s.
Kanye and trump have something in common ... nobody ever understands what they're talking about #DebateNight
I don't think Trump really read his assigned book before doing his report. #Debates2016
Is anyone surprised that Trump literally cannot keep his mouth shut for a whole 2 minutes 🙄 #debates
@HilaryClinton "I made a mistake using a private e-mail."  @realDonaldTrump "That's for sure."  #debatenight
Well, at least he identified everything he says as words. Helpful, D-rump. #debates
Watch Clinton. Look at how calm and smart she is standing right before a professional bully. This is our president. #ImWithHer #debatenight
Can we get back to the issues? I'm not supporting either, but let's move past the email and personal income!  #debatenight #debates
Hillary just spoke like a Russian immigrant learning English for the first time #debatenight
Come on @LesterHoltNBC . .don't let him punk you!!!! #Debates2016 Lester take the wheel !!!
Trump can't even keep himself under law and order in these debates, wth. #debates
How many people who are voting for Trump know what a tax audit is? #debatenight
Can we stop talking about dirty laundry and more about what the future holds? #debatenight #debates #Debates2016
So #HillaryClinton is talking a good talk about the race issue but would she do anything? She clearly killed donald on this #debates
Trump doesn't pay taxes. Oh hell nah and I got to pay out my paycheck each 2 weeks? #debatenight
Easy for a guy w/ FIVE deferments to keep as many military personnel in harm's way as possible #debates
#debatenight Hillary does not cite one credible source to back up her lies.
o.O I'm pretty sure that Trump is wrong about us being in the worst recovery since the Great Depression... #DebateNight
"I have a tremendous income." Yes, we're well aware of that... #DebateNight
How does "we need law and order" address what, precisely, we should do? #debatenight
Hillary Clinton sacrificed her whole fucking life so she could debate this buffoon right now. #debatenight
Trump is acting like a child whose candy was taken from him. #DebateNight #CBSNREAX
“A man who can be provoked by a tweet should not have his fingers anywhere near the nuclear codes." —@HillaryClinton #Debates  #51Million
Trump, again, endorses NY's stop and frisk which was found unconstitutional by a New York Court. #DebateNight
Trump mentions his investments, and property, in every city he mentions. #debatenight
Imagine if this were a negotiation with another country's leader. Do we want a level-headed discussion or a yelling fest? #debatenight
"YOUR President"... I ain't no dog but I just heard a dog whistle... #debatenight #debates #Debates2016
TRADE DEFICIT IS A PART OF US/WORLD TRADE YOU LITERALLY CANNOT AVOID IT #debatenight
racial bias is not just a problem with police RACIAL BIAS IS NOT JUST A PROBLEM WITH POLICE #debatenight
People love me so like therefore I should be prez. Yup. Seems right. #byeboi #debates
Does Trump know there is a difference betwn recovery and bubbles? #debatenight
Trump is now just talking in circles &amp; changing points to his benefits #debates
Trump couldn't complete and trust me I know complete I own complete for a million dollars i made a million dollars this morning #debatenight
I've been to the Dubai airport. They sell 10 ft. golden hookahs. They have a McDonald's. It was built by slaves. It's a nice place. #debates
Ok really, Hillary, talking about hiding things in undisclosed documents isn't your BEST talking point. #debatenight
I've been saying police NEED retraining..I mean a racist is a racist BUT retaining holds them more accountable  #debatenight
Thank you HIllary for being true about the difference between white ppl and black ppl. 👏 #debatenight
Now @realDonaldTrump is correct on the DNC taking advantage of Bernie.  This could've been so different. #debatenight
A presidential candidate yelling over both a woman and a black man during a national televised debate. What a time to be alive. #debatenight
Trump is arguing with the moderator now. That's not how this works! Come on! #Debates
Stop and Frisk!!??? Please, tripling down on law and order, sounds like a police state #Debates2016
Trump throwing these dumb remarks in the middle of Hillary talking just makes him look ridiculous.  #debatenight
What does O's birth certificate have to do with what these two will do as Prez. Lame question @LesterHoltNBC #Debates2016
@twitter #Debates2016 #debates Someone sitting on their bed weighing 4001bs? Really? Is this the clown you want as your president
@twitter @donaldtrump #Debates2016 #debates #debatenight Nato pay fair share? Donald, why don't you pay your fair share of taxes
This guy here... is chest-thumping Tax-returns? Emails? Don't EVER have this guy moderate a 'sand fight' again. #Debates2016
Ohhhh Hilary. Talking about guns. Tread lightly or you're going to lose this round. #debatenight
Someone should have given Hinkley a front row seat, a dvd of Jodi Foster highlights &amp; a copy of 'catcher in the rye" #shitshow #debatenight
Did he just say he's smart for finding ways to not pay taxes? #Debates
@Rod_rigo3 Clinton says she doesn't think he is that rich, how does that matter? Not that many millions but this many #debatenight
English seems to be #drumpf's third language. #AfricanAmerican is hard for him to pronounce. #debates
#drumpf says he was against the war! Just ask his daddy, @seanhannity. Don't listen to his interviews back then, hear him now! #debates 🙄
.@CBSNews Two parties are not enough. As a sponsor of the Presidential Debates, #openthedebates!
Since when do government agencies endorse candidates? This fool can't stop the BULLSHIT from tumbling OUT HIS MOUF #debatenight
Mr Sniffles over here - get this dope a tissue. And while you're at it, a muzzle. #Debates2016
That fact check website advertised on tv has to surely be crashed by now. #Debates2016
Trump speaks in repetitive 2 or 3-word phrases. Might seem simplistic but, remember, most Americans don't have a college degree #debatenight
#debatenight Most settlements are settled without an admission of guilt. That's why they are a settlement and not damages.
@HillaryClinton "Trump paints a bad picture of African American family's"...he didn't say that. Way to spit a script. #debatenight
Trump: Paying zero in taxes "makes me smart".  Yes, we should bear the burden for him. #debates
Hillary's doing a great job.  And Trump failed to "show up and not drool", so this might be judged as a win for her.  🙏 #debates
#debates   "You refused to pay when they finished the work, that you asked them to do."  Got him.
#debates   "DEAL WITH MANDATORY MINIMUM SENTENCES"  THANK YOU. THAT'S ALL THE FUCK YOU NEEDED TO SAY.
"Lester, I think implicit bias is a problem for everyone, not just police."  #debatenight
#Debates He is right! Her temperament got us dozens more terrorist attacks.
Does Trump have an idea how ridiculous "I have a plan to beat ISIS, but I can't tell you until I'm President" sounds? #DebateNight
Law ans order is a TV show. Wtf you gonna do Trump??? #debates2016
@cyndilauper I'm scared of the people who are not seeing how crazy he sounds and will still vote for him... #Debates2016 #HillaryClinton
WHAT DOES IT MATTER about Obama's Birth certificate? It didnt matter then and it matters LESS now #debatenight #debates  #Debates2016
Hillary also owes us a valid explanation about those 33,000 " deleted " emails #debates
@lonelycon I'm enjoying him calling her out on every matter. He is so smart has so much detail in his head. #debatenight #TrumpPence16
Every time #Drumpf fails to complete a thought bc he interrupts himself, #drink. #MakeAmericaDrunkAgain #DumpTrump #debates2016 #WhereIsGary
Has Trump forgotten that the millenials know how to fact check and can simply Google what he's saying if it's bullshit or not? #debatenight
He really does not understand this issue he should quit talking #debatenight
He has such beady eyes, it creeps me out a little #debatenight
I know he's going to say after this debate how unfair they were to him #debatenight
When trump is given facts he just ignores them or denounces them. Really? #Debates
#HillaryClinton can definitely name all 50 state capitals.  Haven't ever found that of much use, except for Jeopardy. #debatenight  .
Oh snap! "Maybe they didn't do a good job" that's why I didn't pay them. #TrumpFails  #DebateNight
#Debates2016 why does Donald trump looks so angry. He looks like a bully
Lester Holt is doing great! We should admit that after we skewered poor Matt Lauer. #DebateNight
@realDonaldTrump you don't need to wait for your audit to finish? The #IRS released a statement about this #debatenight
Clinton and Trump battling over facts on violence rates in NY #debatenight
Lester Holt holds Trump to his focus on Obama's birth certificate up until 2015 #debatenight #Debates2016
How to fight cyber attacks: Clinton- facing 2 adversaries independents &amp; other countries like Russia. #debatenight #Debates2016
#debatenight  look at her stupid face when he brought up the email. Shots fired 😄
Trump wants to take away guns from 'PEOPLE THAT USE THEM.' How is that not gunlickers? #debatenight
Someone should tell Hillary Clinton what about Benghazi your policies in Obama's policies failed #debatenight
One of my favorite words ever made the debate.  braggadocious #debates
.@CBSNews You are a sponsor of the Presidential Debates. More voices = more choices. #openthedebates
Lester is struggling. Where is the law and order in this debate? #Debates2016
People who have looked into our plans have concluded that mine would create 10M jobs and yours (Trump) will lose us 3.5M #debatenight
Hilary knows how to sound progressive, too bad that she's actually just as much of a bourgeois cop lover as he is. #debatenight
Hillary is getting in Donald's Ass. And I'm here for it. #proctologist #debatenight
I would rather read @GovGaryJohnson's tweets on #debatenight than watch the actual train wreck.
#debatenight and yet he donated to charities to work with all those pictures
"Sounds good, never is gonna happen" Oh but the wall will happen~? #debatenight
Yup. He said "law and order." How Nixonian of Donald Trump. #debatenight
You're answer to a follow up question cannot be, "No you're wrong." #Debates2016
my tweets are full of bilious glee and contemptuous schadenfreude but i am bawling in shame and horror behind the screen #debatenight
donald trump would never tell al baghdadi that he's top of the kill list.  #debatenight
as if trump can speak for the country. i'm sorry how representative of the nation are you, again? #debates
apparently the usa is like a 3rd world country in terms of infrastructure #ok #debates
bragging about the fact that his contracters are good? when he doesn't even pay his contracters right? good one  #debates
"I think implicit bias is a problem for everyone, not just police. We all need to be asking hard questions." Hillary, yes. #debatenight
For the record, this segment is about race. DT is talking about gun-wielding gang members, "bad people". #racist #debatenight
Literally cheering for whomever gave HRC a power point on racism!!! #debatenight
This is the most entertaining thing I've ever watched on TV. #debates
@LOLGOP     #DebateNight    Sniffling       #TrumpOnCOKE
Isis wasn't formed while Obama was president... it was made in 1999.. just saying #Debates
YAS! "If you're too dangerous to fly, you're to dangerous to buy!" #debatenight #ImWithHer
Is it just me, or is @realDonaldTrump sounding more like Sarah Palin as the debate progresses? #Debates2016 #DebateNight #debatenight
"We have to know what we're doing"   Do YOU know what you're doing? #Debates
LOL I LOVE HILLARY CLINTON RN SHE EXPOSED DONALD TRUMP 😂😂😂😂😂😂 #Debates
Rome is literally burning and Lester thinks America wants to discuss Obamas birth certificate? Obamas not running!!!! #debatenight
I did a good job asking him to produce a birth certificate. So that's how we fight racism, folks.  #debates
This reminds me of my step mom who screams all loud thinking that she's right but is full of bullshit #debatenight
Trump on Obama and going off to play golf? What alternate Universe are we living in? #debatenight
@ReinceGOP : Maybeline, we're gonna need a lot more lipstick!  Maybeline: sorry, there's not enough to put on that pig. #DebateNight
If he economy is bad, why are there 2 multi millionaires running for president?  #debates #debatenight
lol Trump says he is getting to Penn. Ave one way or the other 😂😂#Debates2016
Trump doesn't plan to pay any debt ... I wouldn't be buying any US government bonds until after nov #Debates2016
"Blowing up an Iranian ship would not start another war"  ???  #Debates2016
I'm more interested in who's going to solve the Isis problem than a birth certificate. #debatenight
"He has a long record of engaging in racist behaviour" Clinton says of Trump's housing policies #TXWatching2016 #debatenight
He's endorsing stop and frisk?!? Someone make him stop taking please. #Debates2016
How are you going to roll up on television, a Presidential candidate and just admit you don't pay taxes? How is he this far!?! #debates
I delete 33,000 emails every day. Most of them are from the IT "help desk" #debatenight
Where were you when #DonaldTrump called birtherism a "great service" to America? #debatenight #debates2016
He also got the endorsement from the Naked Cowboy singing guy in NYC. #proud #endorsements #debatenight
Does Trump's son work for Geek Squad? I'm having an issue with firmware and I would love to have his unreal computer skills. #debatenight
Dude wtf is even going on #debates? It's like I'm on ambien   *Shout out to ambien for sponsoring this debate
I thought he said he was endorsed by ISIS (which wouldn't be too far off) (to be clear, he said ICE) #debatenight #Debates2016
"A man who can be provoked by a tweet should not have his hands anywhere near the nuclear detonator" #Debates2016
Trump hasn't said anything of substance yet. If you listen to this and still support him, you're a masochist. #debatenight
Trump said not paying his taxes makes him smart. Are you all listening to this? #debatenight
i hope Hill Dawg gave Donny her pnuemonia &amp; that's why he's sniffing #debatenight #debates #Debates2016
Trump's sniffing is out of control. Where are the news stories on that? #Debates2016
Learn a lesson, kids: don't snort Adderall before an important event. #DebateNight
We actually have 3 flavors of Law and Order. SVU is my favorite though. #debatenight
I wish Bernie Sanders would charge through the background and be like "Sorry I'm late guys". #debatenight #debates
Yes Hillary lets get it!!! You sound like my boy Bill #Debates2016
I have some duck tape for your stupid arschloch mouth @realDonaldTrump maybe then you'll stop interrupting  #ImWithHer #NeverTrump #debates
This!!!! RT @carlyrosegillis: This is like a drunk Thanksgiving dinner conversation between crazy uncle and righteous mom #Debates2016
I can run a profitable business if I just don't pay ppl who do work for me #Trump #Hillary #debatenight
The only thing that scares me more than Trump is that real people actually believe/support what he is saying. #DebateNight
Please explain how Democrats have abused inner city communities for "over a hundred years". #Debates2016
Oh cool so our possible future president thinks it's smart not to pay taxes, that should really help everyone! #debatenight
This debate is not the lesser of two evils. It is evil and someone who made mistakes but can actually run a country #debatenight
Hillary sounds rly rly stiff while she's speaking, no surprise bc it's all scripted #Debates2016
The worst thing that could EVER happen to trump is people finding out he isn't a billionaire #debates
You say it's unfair the way minorities are treated and yet.. You wanna build a wall?  #debatenight
"We have asked or crowed not to applaud" *Trump supporters clap anyway* 🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄 #debatenight
So Donald, Isis has existed since the 70s, or Hillary Clinton is 39 and holding. #GordonStamperJr #debatenight
@realDonaldTrump: Which Law and Order? The original? Special Victims Unit? Criminal Intent? #GordonStamperJr #debatenight
That right there tells you exactly what you need to know about Trump "why not" what a douche #Debates2016
Donald Trump acts like Hillary has made every political decision in American history #Debates2016
Presidential Debate Question: "How do you heal the racial divide?" More peacemaking and healing!! #debates2016 #systemicracism #diversion
"We lose on everything," said the man with a "winning temperament." #debatenight #debates #factcheck
Listening to the debate on the radio. Couldn't get the sound of Trump sniffling out of my head. #debatenight
He is basically admitting hat he did not pay taxes.  #debatenight
Watching #debatenight we keep asking: What is he saying??? @HillaryClinton can't even keep a straight face
Trump: Many companies were sued for racial discrimination in the 70s, so obviously it was okay. #debatenight
At this point Trump is a toddler having a tantrum. Can someone give him a snack and a nap? #debatenight
Oh man where was trump when ISIS started up. He knows how we could've prevented it all. #debates
#Debates2016 She is good and pissed he brought up #DNCLeaks! #debates #Debates2016 she is switching the narrative. Doesn't matter it's out!
Bruh i dont care about the her damn emails the republicans SPENT OVER $14 MILLION of taxpayers money and found nothing. #debatenight
If #Debates2016 were a football game Trump is up 28-0 first quarter.
Ok. We get it: the countries fucked up! But you wanna be president. What you gonna do about it???! 🙄🙄🙄🙄 #TrumpTrain #Debates2016
The birther issue cant be dismissed easily? At this point, what difference does it make?!? #Debates2016
Yes, because if everyone was home watching Law and Order they can't be out doing crimes. #debatenight
I never could have imagined a world where this was a debate I would see. I literally have a degree in imagining things. #debatenight
"I take advantage of the laws of the nation" - Trump #debatenight
Trickle-down economics created 20 million jobs, @HillaryClinton - that is a failure to you??? #debatenight
On nuclear holocaust -- Trump: "I don't want to take anything off the table" #debatenight
How do you get endorsed by a government agency (ICE)? Isn't that a no-no? #debatenight
Oh please! Who chearleaded the #MassIncarcerationAct &amp; called African American youth #SuperPredators ??? #HillaryClinton 😒 #Debates2016
Can we please get Dave Chappelle with the wrap it up box as the next debate moderator? #debatenight
Sure, USA should have stolen all of Iraq's oil. On an operation that was ostensibly about removing Saddam 4 human rights abuses #debatenight
Law and Order for Trump is stopping anyone from doing anything. #debatenight
Hey, here's a question in relation to this for the both of ya: WHAT DO YOU DO FOR THE RACIST COPS THAT KEEP SHOOTING!? #debatenight
@realDonaldTrump mansplaining is more effective when you use complete sentences.   #fatsoforprez5 #debatenight
I think...I feel...I did....I know....I, I, I.....    I got Obama to produce his birth certificate -the Donald #Debates2016
This is actually raising my blood pressure... I can feel it #debatenight
Yes offense but this country is screwed no matter who wins this election 🙄 #debatenight
Last ten years of political hacks. The GOP candidate just knocked two years of GOP supermajority; any republicans care? No. #debatenight
He said he has better judgment and temperament than her! 😷 🤔 #debatenight #cantbereallife
The level of Trumps empathy for a city is directly related to how many investments and properties he has there #debatenight
We have to deal with mandatory sentencing that has "put too many people away for too long for doing too little" @HillaryClinton #debatenight
i've always loved debates but seriously America what are we doing
Im done with twitter. These memes are too much. If you want my reaction watch my snapchat Its Just SuperSamTheHam #debatenight
I think it's 5 trillion personally. Yep, why not. Why not a gillizon dollars Donald? #debatenight
I give the win to Hillary: "anyone who can be provoked by a tweet shouldn't have control of nuclear weapons".  #debatenight #everyoneloses
@CBSNLive "Crime is down 50% since 1991" - Clinton - You can thank Roe vs. Wade for that one, not your or your husband's policies. #debates
When did #Debates2016 jump the shark? I think it was at minute 10
This man really just said he had common sense. The biggest lie of the night #Debates2016
I totally just missed what he was saying because all I heard was blah blah blah Law and Order blaaahhh #debatenight
HC supported NAFTA until running 4 president, she said NAFTA was a free and fair trade agreement and it's  proving its worth. #debatenight
I hope someone is racing the number of Trump sniffles versus Trump interruptions #debates
Ya really want this guy in charge? This guy!? Seriously??  #Debates
We're a third world country, Donald? Maybe you need to travel to a few more places! #debatenight
Can we talk about #mentalhealth now?  #Trump thinks he has a better temperament than #Hilary.  #debatenight
Repeating the same thing over and over does not actually make it work, Trump #debatenight
Ha!" I'm going to be blamed for everything" - Clinton. It's so true I am going to cry. #debatenight
Oh hey, Clinton has an actual plan. Why is there even a question about her right now? The alt is BIGLY #debatenight
#Debates2016 - she is silk;y smooth, while he's abrasive and rude. She has facts and class. He's an ass, as are her cheering supporters.
#Debates2016 I think grinding it out in the cities listening to people instead holing up digging dirt is preparing for president.
#Debates2016 Sidney Bloomenthal was the one doing the the business in Benghazi.
I rather my President know something about politics, war, defense, and people....not just money 🤔 #debatenight #TheDebate
Trump talking about taking their oil. Boy, it's 9/11 all over again. #debatenight
I love how woke @TreySongz is. I also love he is watching the debates tonight.

I'm honestly getting tired of Trump's sniffs and I heard it loud lol #debatenight
Watch Trump going to say something ignorant about police brutality 😐 #debatenight
Once again with the doom and gloom from Trump. No ideas, just gloom and doom.   #debatenight
Trump just made a cheap shot about Hillary preparing for the debate.  #debatenight
# #debates Hillary doing super job despite DTs camera hogging. #LesterHolt, hang in harder. SHUT HIM UP when it's not his turn.
Cooperation with the Muslim community abroad and domestic. Well said, Clinton. Spoken like a leader. #debatenight
Is it #Halloween? Maybe a joke? Frightening that these are the 2 viable choices we have for #presidency. #debatenight
I can hear half of America whispering "what does implicit mean" #debatenight
About time Hillary, tell it like it is!! Pay your bills Trump #Debates
'That makes me smart....' paying no federal income tax.  Selfish bastard puts the strain of paying for things on the middle class. #Debates

HRC: I'm gonna be blamed for everything tonight. (t)Rump: Why not?  #Debates2016  Yeah. Democracy.
Are police are afraid? Sounds like we need some BETTER FUCKING POLICE, HUH?  #Debates2016

"You know what else I prepared for...to be President of the United States" #HillaryClinton #DebateNight
Trump's taxes "would be squandered, too" suggests he really didn't pay federal income taxes. #debatenight
Judge "is a very against judge." -Trump, who has the best words. #debatenight
Applause/whoops break out despite warnings after "I will release my tax returns when she releases her 33,000 deleted emails." #debatenight
.@realDonaldTrump says that taxes are the way they are because we have failed leadership. #debatenight
Holt moves conversation to the topic of race and the division the country is faced with. #debatenight
It's like debating with a two year old. Slay Hillary, slay. Put this crybaby to bed. #debatenight

Not paying income tax makes you smart Donnie? Good to know #debatenight #Debates
Donald Trump keeps shouting WRONG and NO and NOT TRUE but for some odd reason I'm having trouble believing him #debatenight #debates
If I was Trump, I don't know if I would talk about the emails. It's gotta be the thing Hillary has prepared for most #debates
Why hackers gotta be 400lbs, Trump!? Fuck you! Lost my vote. #debates  #debatenight
Trump would be much more punchy if he didn't say the exact same shit five times in a row #debatenight
The only *real* flaw Hillary supporters keep pointing out is a deleted tweet. Did you forget SHE deleted THOUSANDS of emails??? #debates
Implicit #bias a problem for all of us but can have fatal consequences in criminal justice system. @HillaryClinton #Debates2016

She's landed a couple of really solid punches so far! He's out of his league. #Debates2016
Hey, give him credit. Donald Trump's race relations expertise extends all the way from DEATH WISH 1 through 4. #Debates2016
If he makes America great again, I'll be making Canada greater. #debatenight

Did Trump just say he stiffed contractors because he took advantage of the laws? What the fuck?Then just dropped an ad 4 hotel #debatenight
A person who complains about airports is someone I really love talking to. #debatenight

@BernieSanders we need you man this election is a real shit show #debatenight
#Debates2016 Hilary's lookin @ Trump like GOD PLS BRING ON A HEART ATTACK ON HIM SO HE CAN STFU
#debatenight Donnie let's black folks in his night club?give him a cookie.
#Debates Trump bringing up Clinton's use of the word 'superpredator' is shameful. She's already apologised; time to move on. People change.
Someone should tell Trump he's supposed to be debating with Hillary, not Lester. #debatenight
@vidabuttahunney @cemorecake718 Yes, but that's how debates are .. She has to come better than that .. Speak up .. Spill tea etc
Hillary, stop baseless guessing why Trump is not releasing  tax returns -it's disgraceful! #debatenight #debate #nbc
This "presidential" debate has to be a joke. Does the real one come on at 10? #DebateNight
He said "My obligation right now is to do well for myself"... #debatenight
"Trumped Up Trickle Down" Is that why you're not releasing your taxes @realDonaldTrump ? #debatenight
I don't know why I am watching the debates right now or why I'm interested in it o-o
Are we watching an episode of #TheOffice right now and we just haven't cut to the theme song yet??? #debatenight
Trump cares that NATO countries pay their fair share, when he pays jackshit to the US govt. #debatenight #debates #Debates2016
no body told @realDonaldTrump the first rule of #debatenight ? never answer the question you're asked.
lebron is the only candidate on stage who voted for the iraq war. #debates2016 #maga https://t.co/um5wjxeekr
#Debates Trump really does like to avoid answering the question. "Law and Order" is not elaborate enough. It isnt an end-all statement.
Just to be clear; there is no good answer to this race question #debatenight
#Trump really is either #drunkuncle or that girl you always run into at a party.(s/o @nbcsnl ) #Debates2016
#debates FFS Hillar you have had 12 Years as Democrat with Obama to fix all your talking about &amp; Its still Fkd #liar #stillpullingsamecrap

@drumpf are you bragging about being audited that is not a good thing #debatenight
Donald Trump says will release tax returns if Hillary Clinton releases 33,000 deleted emails. #debatenight
@HillaryClinton has detailed plans to address issues with race. Trump literally just says, "law and order." #Debate  #Debates2016
Yes the wealthy create jobs, but do they pay their employees? *Looks at #Trump*  #Debates
How does @HillaryClinton speak with credibility and a straight face on cyber security?!  #Debates2016

Oh God! No excuse me (Lester interject) and now to our next question. #Debates2016 #DebateNight
Trump very cavalier about the new word "cavalier" that he just learned from the madam secretary #debates
Jobs are hard to obtain in this country and Trumps worried about the quality of our airports... #debates
Hilary is really spitting game to the majority of this country(middle class) #debates
Hilary Clinton must think she is part of a comedy sketch #debates
#NYDebate #debatenight Did Truman admit that he pays less in taxes (so his share wouldn't be "squandered")?
#NYDebate #debatenight @LesterHoltNBC, pls tell Trump &amp; Hillary that race isn't just about crime or Obama’s birth certificate.
Lol but he hasn't once denied Hilary's allegations about his taxes 🙃😂 #debatenight #ineedpopcorn #jollofwilldo #thistoomuch
#debates Hillary,Mr.Clinton laid the ground work for stop &amp; frisk &amp; bad policing, harsher sentences for Blacks. Can't just say I'm sorry.🙌🏾
Is Trump going to debate or is he just going to state his "accomplishments" and pat himself on the back all night? #debates
He really just said he supported stop-and-frisk. Why? Because he's a racist. #debates2016
60 more minutes wait for it the short circuited brain flash is on the way #debatenight
He so slick with those side comments. He's telling the world he's a shady fuck #debatenight
BIG INSULT to #BlackLivesMatter &amp; ALL USA;Trump says we must "bring back "law &amp; order" while Blacks r being KILLED by brutality! #debates

Trickle Down Economics didn't work in the 1980"s.  It has NEVER worked.#Debates2016 #TrumpedupTrickleDownEconomics
He has a winning temperament but does he gave tiger blood? #Debates2016
Clinton: we have to have an intelligence surge. We have to work more closely w allies. #debatenight #debate2016
Ah, another trap: Chicago gun violence. Shell bring up that many of those guns come from Pence's state. #debatenight
If, in a democracy, the people get the government they deserve, what does tonight say about us? #debatenight
Trump gets his reports, that he just saw, and sites the onion #debatenight
Make America 2008 again.  Yeah, I remember the recession. #itsstillbetter #debatenight I'm going to  @TheComedyStore to forget life.

"Babe I don't know why she said she was with me, I was at work until midnight. Don't believe me? #CallSeanHannity" #debatenight

lots of words come out of Donald's mouth but he never really says anything.  #somanywords #debatenight
Ok on another note .. I can't wait to see @jimmyfallon do Trump impersonations LOL . #debatenight
We don't use the phrase "3rd world country" anymore, buddy, but that's the beside the point. #debatenight #ImWithHer

Hey @NBCNews, could you turn Lester Holt's mic on when you have a moment? #debatenight
I'm so sorry for those who disagree, but she is so ready to become Madame @Madam_President #ImWithHer #debatenight
"Let's start the clock again, Lester." - Me, every time this asshole interrupts. #DebateNight
When is getting audited every year for 15 years a good thing...? #debatenight
Hey Trump? You pillage the "Inner cities" to get cheap real estate for your gaudy monstrosities. #Debates
"It's terrible there, I have property there"   this statement seems like this for his own personal gain. #debatenight #Debates2016
Trump paid no federal income tax? That should be all of us ;) #debates
Both Hillary and Trump want to stop people on terrorist watch list from getting guns- but too many innocent people on list. #debates

Trump's arrogance and rudeness makes me wish I had a bottle of vodka. #debatenight
Trump is about to name how many black people have been to his house. #debatenight
I'm am not voting for either candidate but Donald Trump sounds very uneducated when he talks #debatenight
Didn't he say he disagreed with NATO just a few minutes ago? #Debates
You need to understand they dont want to take the guns away they just want to make it harder for people to obtain #debatenight
Race determines how people are treated in criminal justice system, where they live, #SyrRelPol #debates @HillaryClinton

#DonaldTrump thinks paying no taxes shows he's smart. The system favors the rich #debatenight #Debates2016
#trump must bring up #Benghazi and fact she won't say radical Islamic terrorism.  #debates #Debates2016 #debatenight
Why does Trump keep denying that he supported the war on Iraq 🇮🇶 #debatenight
How much @NBC paying him for say "Law and Order"? Lol 😆 #debatenight
STOP DEFENDING YOURSELF AND HIT HER ON MONEY FROM FOREIGN COUNTRIES #Debates2016
Finally 2 rich white people telling how it is to live poor and ethnic #debatenight #debates #Debates2016
Trump uses terms like "I feel" and "I think" as well as "probably" in order to avoid giving definitively false statements. #debatenight"
Donald Trump sniffling. Either he's unhealthy or he's on that Macho Man #debatenight
So basically, law and order and there have been thousands of shootings and Obama is the reason #PresidentialDebate #debatenight

Did he really just say that Obama administration created ISIS? Someone please tell me I misunderstood. #debatenight
It's almost as if Hilary has done something like this before. #debates #debates2016 Trump is getting smoked.
Trump looks like a fuckboi who's gf figured out the password to his phone. #debatenight #debates #Debates2016
Let's move to something less divisive. Can you two old white fucks please speak to the plight of black americans? #debatenight #debates
Dear Donald Trump, We don't like you, stop jacking that. - The African American Community  #DebateNight
Stop and frisk also disproportionately targets the Black and Latino communities. Which is not going to help. #Debates
Trump talking like he's reading a high school kids rough draft essay #Debates
I'm assuming candidates are trained to speak for ALL to be able to follow, but if not, I'm starting to feel *very* intelligent. #debatenight
my favorite lesson from Trump. if you don't admit it, it didn't happen. #debatenight #PresidentialDebate
If @GlynL was awake instead of pulling the first fresher he could find in Arena, he'd be making some shit joke about #dabate. #debatenight
@HillaryClinton done gave us a black church sermon title "Trumped up Trickle Down" 😂 #debatenight
Aw shit @realDonaldTrump tread softly with this topic, don't be crazy 😂 #debatenight
Nixon released his tax returns during an audit, it shouldn't be a problem for Trump #debatenight

If the debate ain't talking about free college tuition then it ain't for me #debatenight
The #Debates2016 are hurting my head. How can they be reduced to this farce? If fact checkers were used earlier we wouldn't be here! #lies
Mr Trump, can you answer one simple question without beating about the forest? Your record of racial abuse appauls us #Debates2016  #debates
#debatenight I'm looking forward more to #SNL debate than this rehearsal going on right now

Trust can be restored when citizens can learn to respect police and vice versa #debatenight
"We have to address the institutional racism in our criminal system"  - @HillaryClinton #debatenight

Lester interrupts to talk about race. The steady decline begins now. #debates
.@HillaryClinton calls private server "a mistake...if I had to do it over again I would obviously do it differently" #Debates2016 @PIX11News
We're watching their temperaments side-by-side right now... And #DonaldTrump looses that matchup. #debatenight
Hillary was "First Lady." What's male equivalent? Will Bill be referred to as "First Gentleman"? Sounds wrong on many levels. #DebateNight
Nice how Trump threw two other people under the bus on the birther issue. #debatenight
I like that Lester Holt had to point out this segment is about racial healing as Donald Trump persecutes our first black pres. #debatenight
Trump is talking to us like he's a coach and the US is the baseball team: "we're losing everything" #debatenight
Jeez trump we get it you're against the war. Move on my man #debatenight
If @realDonaldTrump had a dime for every time he declared bankruptcy, he probably wouldn't have to do it so often. #debatenight
Donald's ugly face and snarky smirk makes me feel like the devils is staring at me. #Debates2016
My Twitter is lagging because of all the tweets about the #DebateNight
oh my god! nobody cares about where Obama was born! Talk about real issues. #debates2016
@realDonaldTrump keep coming up with "I will when they will" excuses.  #releaseyourtaxreturns #debatenight
He said "Why not" as a reason  a real life candidate for PRESIDENT #debatenight
Watching #debatenight at #rushstreet in Culver City. Very glad to have the distraction of debate bingo and a drink in hand so I don't stress
It gives me anxiety when they start talking loudly over each other. And it gets louder and louder 😆Take your turns! #debatenight
@HilaryClinton @realDonaldTrump Focus on maximizing the size of pie, not just "America's" slice. Collaboration not just cooperation #debates
Trump now admits to settling a Justice Dept. suit for discrimination against Af-Ams. Then says everybody was doing it. #debatenight
Laws already exist. Policemen are the problem sir.   Also same: what are actual real actions you'll take?? #debatenight
"When they go low, we go high" -Hillary quoting Michelle Obama on debate stage in reference to Trump's birthing allegations. #debatenight
Sued for eating a family's dog. But so were a lot of bears. It's just one of things #debatenight
They both are talking about plans while never bringing their own to the table #debatenight

Dumb bitch is forgetting she is rich and part of the top  #Debates
"Let's talk about race,"- Lester Holt  Oh Christ here we go.  #debatenight #ImWithHer
Anyone who starts their argument with "believe me..." suggests there is something unbelieveable about what they are saying. #debatenight
And I'm still here waiting for them to  talk bout when half life 3 drops #debatenight
Trump knows the bully pulpit is not actually for bullies right? #debatenight
There's a guy peeing next to me in Walmart... 😨 He just moaned and flushed the toilet... #debates
Donald Trump can't answer a question. How can you elect him president? #DebateNight #Debates2016 #HillaryClinton
"I have a much better temperament than she had"  "I have a winning temperament"   What is this? #debatenight
Trump loves Law and Order because sometimes people would watch The Apprentice beforehand. #DebateNight
#debatenight wow @HillaryClinton has patience.  And why aren't they actually addressing the race segment with the weight it deserves
I would have died no less than 4 times if I were playing a debate drinking game. #debatenight #Debates2016
Sweet mother of God... This is embarrassing 🙄 — watching Presidential Debates 2016

Hard truth: @realdonaldtrump is only on stage tonight bc of the racist birtherism he led for years. He should man up/apologize. #DebateNight
Where exactly did Trump go to school? It's like he slept in every class and read no books #debatenight
So happy I get to watch the live streaming of the decline of America :) #Debates
Aaaaaaand a subtle fat shame thrown in for good measure. Always a class act, Donald! #debatenight
I wonder how long Killary looked in the mirror &amp; practiced that disgusting laugh . . Or maybe it's the drugs  #debatenight
Man, I was initially nervous about this debate but we all know who won this thing. #debates #believeme
Oh yeah because going on Howard Stern means you're on a valid news show when discussing your stance on Iraq. #Debates2016
Trump just called LaGuardia a third world airport.  Zero Pinocchios! #debatenight
Wait so is it the audit or is it the emails holding back your tax return? #debatenight
#debates #debatenight #debate2016 Both candidates want fundamental rights denied if one is on a secret gov't list.

Trump: "Secretary Clinton doesn't want to use a couple of words, and that's 'law' and 'order.'" #debatenight #Debates2016
Clinton says police can deal with implicit bias by retraining police officers. #debatenight
Marginal tax rates kick in at 6 digits + &lt;400K I don't think u need 2 prioritize tax cuts. Spread wealth round via opportunity #debatenight
Funny, Donald is embarrased bout certain questions on national stage (Birthism). At republican debates he spoke bout his penis #debatenight
Anyone wanna hop on the party bus with me and get the fuck out of this country while we can? 😂 #debatenight

Trump: "I've been under audit for 15 years." #Debates2016 Is that meant to be a good thing?
I think Clinton is about to be blamed for the everything. Guess she caused the Titanic to sink too. 😒#Debates
The "they go low, we go high" quote gets me every time. 💪🏼 @FLOTUS #Debates2016
I can't believe this is the debate we're having, no one is answering any questions... #debates
#Debates2016 Trumps losing it, like a spoiled child interupting Clinton, has to be called out by moderator.

What I've learned so far: Donald Trump's favorite show - Law and Order #debatenight

On not paying his worksrs: Did @realDonaldTrump rly respond to that Q by saying "maybe they didn't do a good job?" #Icant #debatenight
Hilary holding a steady smirk like a true woman would 🙃 she ain't happy tho #debates
Hillary had nothing to do with Birtherism. This has been tried, tested, and disproven. #debatenight #debates
@billmaher Seriously, how is it that @realDonaldTrump is even an option for candidacy? He is stating opinions &amp; no action plan. #Debates2016
Was Sec. Clinton's nose scratch a way to call out Trump's cocaine sniffles? #debates
Lol trump talking is the funniest thing on tv right now #Trump #debatenight
Racist birther lie? Hillary, you started this bullshit racist birther lie tho... You forgot? #debatenight
Trump: Don't be calling me out cause my racism a little different from how you racism, shit... #debatenight
"As soon as she releases her emails she deleted, I'll release my tax returns!" #DebateNight.
34 minutes in I have the summary of not only the first presidential debate, but also the election: What the fuck is happening? #debatenight
Not sure one cherry-picked building project translates into running a country ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ #Debates2016
The more he speaks @realDonaldTrump the more I feel sorry for the clueless thinking they should vote for him. #debatenight #TurnOffHisMic
Am I the only one who doesn't give a fuck about #debatenight
Hillary: 'Just listen to what you heard' #debatenight   And that's how it's done.
Trump calling the US a third-world country is insulting to those of us who pay our taxes. #HofDebate16 #DebateNight #Debate2016
"Secretary of Clinton doesn't want to use two words. Law and Order". Boom. #debatenight #MAGA
"Law and order in the inner city" is basically sanctioning of a police state in certain communities. #Debates2016
If we need a great business man to run the country why can't Apple's CEO?! Or Jeff Bezos from Amazon??? #DebateNight
Hillary obviously had a big dose of Levadopa! She can hardly keep her eyes open. Too much blinking. Hope an ambulance is standing by#debates
What a gentlemen trump is for allowing Hilary to speak 🙄 #debatenight #ImWithHer
Okay, pretty disappointed this has already dissolved into tax returns and emails. #debatenight
The stop &amp; frisk policy is LITERALLY UNCONSTITUTIONAL and yet Trump wants to bring it back. #DebateNight
I hate that I don't have a high enough vocabulary to describe my disappointment in this presidential election #debatenight #debates
No election needed. Snapchat can tell us who had the most dalmatian filters &amp; that person is the president. Brown dog loses. #debatenight 🇺🇸
If our economy was as strong as Hillary's hair spray we'd be in good shape. #Debates
Lester Holt tell this dude you can respond when the Fck you say so. Control this sh*t Lester. #debatenight
Is someone keeping track of all the people he has made fun of or insulted during this debate? #debatenight
Everytime Donald says "no I didn't say that", his team must be doing a major CTRL+F on his Twitter feed and rapidly deleting. #debates
Clinton sounds like a robot. And Trump a senile old man. #debatenight
@realDonaldTrump is a nut. @BarackObama should have produced his birth certificate but he doesn't have to produce his taxes🤔 #debatenight
@DonaldTrump just stick to the facts Donald and stop with all the digs. #debatenight #ImWithHer
The IRS released a statement that being audited does not conflict with @realDonaldTrump's ability to release his tax returns #debates
Secretary @HillaryClinton I'm so glad you're showing 0 emotion because dude really trying you   #debatenight
POTUS choices:   1.  Bernie Sanders, 2.  Hillary Clinton or Jill Stein, 3.  Hillary Clinton or Jill Stein,  #NeverTrump ...#Debates
#Hillary should be in PR she is dropping promos left and right yesssss #DebateNight
Five minutes talking about tax returns. Way to keep your audience engaged, guys. #PresidentialDebate #Debates2016
If you've ever flown into a 3rd world country, you know that no U.S. airport compares ... #debatenight #Debates2016
It's about time this country had someone running who has an idea about money. How many times have you declared bankruptcy? #debatenight
Trump's scope is tens of thousands out of hundreds of millions. Says a lot about classism in America #debatenight
Trump can't seem to rein in his middle-school playground bully.  #debatenight
#CrookedHillary seems to say things to get a response from the audience... What is there to laugh/smile about??? 🤔🙄#debatenight
Trump talks about his endorsements while @HillaryClinton talks about her policies. Priorities are clear. #ImWithHer #debatenight
Hillary wouldn't know cyber-security if it hit her in the ass! #debates #Debates2016 #TrumpPence16
Was that the question? (Applicable for pretty much any response) He's confused. #debates
Will @HillaryClinton fact checkers please check if #bigly is a word? I'm worried a potential POTUS cannot speak proper English. #Debates2016
Notice that Trump's only connection to any given community in America is investments or property #Debates
Stop &amp; Frisk work? Ok! So when the police killed Eric Garner, someone who was unarmed... What should we do to stop that? #debatenight
I'm waiting for Ashton Kutcher to come out behind dumb and dumber and tell America we have been Punked #Debates2016 #wtf
Trump sounds like the dude in office space yelling "I'm a people person!!!! What's wrong with you people?!?!?!" #debatenight
Waiting for one of them to say "live from new York it's Saturday night!" and just hope it's a bad SNL sketch #Debates2016
Temperament. I do not think it means what you think it means. #debatenight
"We will take out ISIS to the best Mexican restaurants, which we have at Trump Tower by the way." #debatenight
I'm living in hell. I didn't know ... thanks @realDonaldTrump  ... really??? How many black people do you know? #debatenight
Should I wash my hair or repaint my nails......maybe finish up the movie I started watching last night...? Anything from this! #DebateNight
New drinking game:  Take a drink every time Trump or Hillary cuts off Lester Holt. #Debates2016
Lots of zingers on both sides. "I guess I'm going to be blamed for everything" - Hillary. "Why not" - Trump #debatenight
I'm glad that Trump has decided that he is the arbiter for truth in this debate. #debatenight
#debatenight who knows anyone's private business dealings? Her speculations are horrific. Where are those deleted emails? #CrookedHillary
Maybe the US wouldn't be so badly in debt if people paid their taxes, Donald #debates
Uh oh, @HillaryClinton brought guns into it. Lost 30% of the viewership. #debatenight
TRUMP IS ANSWERING A QUESTION ABOUT RACIAL DIVIDE WITH BLATANT RACISM 😶🤔 #debatenight  #Debates2016  #FuckTrump #wtf
#debates oh my God. Hillary just gave us some statistics. Some real life statistics
I can't believe he keeps doubling down on " stop and frisk" #debatenight
I have a feeling I'm going to be blamed for everything that's ever happened. #debatenight @HillaryClinton
@reenaninan Like @vladduthiersCBS said before the CBS Network special on #CBSN, it's an @WWE match! Post show at 11! #CBSNReax #Debates2016
Trump has been shouting at and over Hillary. She's not doing the same to Trump. No idea if that's a good strategy. #debatenight
Nobody had Trump blow his nose before he went on stage? #debatenight
Only one of these candidates is even remotely presidential. How can anyone support this guy after tonight? #baffled #Debates2016 #ImWithHer
@HillaryClinton #debatenight She's prepared to be President and it's a good thing! You're correct Hillary!
Flonase could make a SICK compilation commercial of trump right now. #Debates2016 #stopandsniff
Glad I'm not watching the debate. The tweets I'm reading are good enough for me. #DebateNight
POTUS has to be SEETHING right now with Trump dropping facts about his 8 years in office #debates
I stayed home to prepare for this debate. Know what else? I've prepared to be President.💥💥💥💥💥 #Debates2016
The audience giggled like somebody farted in class when @realDonaldTrump said he has a better temperament than @HillaryClinton #debatenight
Somewhere out there,  a 400lb man on a bed shrieks #Debates2016
Even if you hate her how can he possibly be an acceptable alternative? #debatenight
The question is about cyber security...  and Trump talks about endorsements. WHAT?!  #debates
Trump is sick. He has a cold or something and I feel bad for him. Terrible timing #debatenight
#HillaryClinton accuses #DonaldTrump of having long record of racial prejudice including falsely accusing #Obama re: birth cert#debatenight
He's shaming her about super-predator but says that all black people are in danger of being shot at any given time #DebateNight
Trump seems to have run out of energy after 77 min  Maybe took his Claratin three hours ago?   #Snuffling #debatenight
LOL, yeah Hillary, you know all about the cyber stuff, don't you... #debatenight
Hawaii is in the USA? Oh that explains some stuff.  #debatenight
Omg what is Trump even saying 😕He is seriously out of his league... 😂#Debates2016
#Debates2016 Clinton has really got Trump riled up. She's confident &amp; smiling. He's pouting &amp; on the defensive.
Did Trump just admit he doesn't pay federal income tax? That sounds like an admission to me. #debatenight
God help us that the old post office is the only way you get to Pennsylvania Ave. Donald. #debatenight
Trump has more endorsements than the entire US Olympic team is what he's trying to say, amirite? #Debates2016
Trump is channeling generation upon generation of crazy incoherent racist uncles. #DebateNight
Thank you DT #debatenight now tell them she gave them the weapons.
"I have a much better temperament" -@realDonaldTrump The audience immediately follows with LOL 😂😂😂  #debatenight #Debates
Why do they keep referring to her as secretary? She has held no official office in nearly 4 years.  #debates
Wayment @realDonaldTrump just said with a straight voice that he has the better temperament 😂😂😂 this is a joke #debatenight
"I'm relieved my late father never did business with you." DAMN. #debates
Shall we remind Donald Trump of the things his former campaign manager said about him?! Mmk. #debatenight #debates
@HillaryClinton also us racist to Obama and blacks.  Using fake black voice, she was a birther, &amp; called blk men predators. #Debates2016
Damn calling @seanhannity, tell us what you said and feel even now @realDonaldTrump, you're on the grand stage! #debatenight
I'm not even watching the debates and I can tell you what these asshats think about the issues.
FINALLY ARTICLE V PROPERLY USED. Clinton picking it up and closing strong. #debates2016
Watching the Presidental Debate aka watching two adults bicker like children #debatenight
Did he just say bragadocious? How do you even spell that? #debatenight
Clinton blaming cops training so wrong! Blaming guns just as bad. Cops are not the problem #debatenight
Trump is being clear he will work to help intercities, something that Democrats failed to do Point Trump #debatenight
Did Trump just say that he's the one that got @POTUS to release his birth certificate? And that's not the craziest thing he said. #debates
He is literally admitting that he takes advantage of legal loop holes. How is this real?? #debatenight
Hillary said that Trump was involved with ISIS 😂😂😂 savage  #Debates
Why am I watching this debate?? I was drunk and having fun a while ago. Now I'm just like... 🤔 ...Good luck to you, America. #debatenight
Waitwaitwait. Did Trump say that he was able to get Obama's birth certificate?? Are you fucking serious?! #Debates2016
"I will release mine taxes when she release her 33,000 DELETED emails" 😂😂😂😂 #debatenight #TRUMP
Every woman in America is painfully relating to having a calm, nuanced point while a man without your experience yells over you #debatenight
YOU DON'T MIND RELEASING?!?!?!  But you haven't eve- Shut up, Lex #debatenight
News flash: "Bad people" don't actually BUY guns. They "acquire" them. #debatenight
Trump asserts his temperament is 1 of his best qualities. "I have a much better temperament than Clinton." #debates …
We need an intelligence surge to find every scrap of information regarding Trump's plans about..anything. #Debates2016
I don't like the fact that Trump is always putting the blame on someone.  Hillary to be specific.  #Debates2016
"if you're too dangerous to fly,  you're too dangerous to buy a gun". -  Hillary.  Sub!!!  #debatenight
Trump just swung really low with that classified email comment lol #debatenight
@LesterHoltNBC @NBCNews #debatenight #Debates2016 Donald why r u insisting on high tax cuts 4 rich&amp;say of middle class that's how get rich
"You know what else I prepared for....to be president" Nailed it Hillary #Debates2016
"Living in hell" "It's a 3rd world country" where are you hanging out Mr. Trump? #debates
I won't make that much money in my lifetime! Wow. However, I bet I get 33,000 emails by the end of this week. #debates
You do not take a right away from someone because you think they might commit a crime #basicconceptsofliberty #debatenight #LetGaryDebate
@taraneverbland if this debate was a drinking game for every word trump makes up I'd be wasted #debatenight #redwineme
C'mon Drumpf, drop that "Stonetear" keyword and force the world to google it!!! #debates
Why the hell is Holt allowing this douchebag to rebut her rebuttal? #Debates2016
Why does this feel like parts of this debate are going to end up on Worldstar? #Debates #Worldstar
TT CANADA 21:47 1.#debatenight 2.Smoak 3.Dee Gordon 4.Mexico and China 5.#UnlikelyDebateGuests 6.#DWTS 7.Marlins 8.Benoit 9.Headley
Is Donald Trump running for THE MOST VAGUE PERSON EVER?? Get the man a thesaurus. #DebateNight
#Debates Cybersecurity being discussed by clinton? Here comes the "pot calling the kettle black".
Maybe we're saying "muslims" wrong. These two just said Moo-slims over and over again! #debatenight #debates2016
Smiles, looks like a goof.  Stops smiling, looks like the Crypt Keeper. #DebateNight #ShitShow
So as far as I'm concerned this has got to be the most vague debate I have ever seen. Bro don't leave us @POTUS. #DebateNight
if Hillary Clinton "has been fighting ISIS her whole adult life" she must be 26 years. No wonder she isn't qualified to be pres #debatenight
@realDonaldTrump Obama may go go golf , but ur coming from one and that's not a road to the white hoUse. #debatenight @HFA
#debatenight Hillary just said black communities were thriving.They R killing EACH OTHER in Chicago and  other cities.  All run by Dems btw
"Secretary Clinton is afraid to use a few words. Law and order" - trump. She said Law, and we need to obey it. @realDonaldTrump #debatenight
OMG the next time @realDonaldTrump snorts I'm going to throw up in my mouth  #TrumpSnorts #Debates2016 #debatenight
If this was an episode of "Yo Momma" then this would be perfect. Unfortunately, it's the first debate. #DebateNight
Not paying tax makes Trump smart? Selfish more like? Hypocrite after complaining about Mexico not pay a tax on trade #debatenight
How about we get the FBI to step up their game? They've let how many terrorists (and crooks like @HillaryClinton)slide through #debatenight
And now Trump thinks he's developed very very good relationships over the last little while with the African American community #debatenight
What in the hell is Trump saying?  Can we get someone to do sign language or something?  #Debates2016
THE IRAQ WAR WAS A REPUBLICAN. Jesus Christ. Wow. I'm dying here. #debatenight
Trump talking about racism &amp; all the Blacks who get shot after announcing Fraternal Order of Police endorse him = priceless. #debatenight
Can anyone follow this insane rambling? Did he seriously just say "My best asset is my winning temperament"? #debatenight
Stop and Frisk is RACIAL PROFILING !!!!! I'M GETTING UPSET NOW #debatenight
Wait! The inner city can't get Law and Order? Don't they have @USA_Network? #debatenight
I think we've grown numb to how self-contradictory Trump constantly is. He's always strong, great, very clear, beautiful, etc. #debatenight
African American community and inner city community are not interchangeable phrases!!!! That is RACISM #debatenight
You know what else I prepared for? I prepared to be President. And I think that is a good thing.  #debatenight
Everyone else did it too! I settled with no admission of guilt! #debatenight
#Crimes spiked last year, Hillary. That was revealed today. Nice try! #fail  #Debates
I don't know if I should root for #GiantDouche or #TurdSandwich  Meh, fuck it. I think I'll just #FeelTheJohnson instead.   #Debates2016
@realDonaldTrump how does obamas birth certificate and Isis have any relevancy to each other? #debatenight #Debates2016 #debates
THIS MAN WENT BANKRUPT LIKE 7 TIMES AND HES TALKING MONEY #debatenight #debate2016
The debate snark on Twitter is glorious tonight. This might just be the snarkinest I've ever seen it. Keep it up!  #debates
Why does it seem these questions are directed at undermining Trump? #Debates2016
He's going to change the laws that allow him to loophole his way to a profit?  #debate #debatenight
I like how he describes the failure to crush Isis the way I discuss getting the fake ending in Castlevania SotN #debatenight #Debates2016
Like Sean Hannity is the guy to put as your reference #debatenight #Debates2016
In this instance the fact that HRC is a huge wonk is paying big dividends. #debatenight #Cato2016
"I just sounded like an irate lunatic for 3 minutes, so let me real quick criticize @HillaryClinton over temperament." Mkay. 🙄🙄 #debatenight
Country too busy live-tweeting to process that it might be hurtling toward the end times. #debates #Debates2016 #debatenight
.@HillaryClinton has to tread so carefully as she answers this question on race in the US. People are listening intently. #debates
So you're bragging about making a man prove he's a citizen? I can't believe this. #DebateNight
I thought Hillary was gonna say "they do it for the lulz" #Debates
Isn't it concerning that a significant portion of pro Trump tweets are prejudice, sexist, and overall hateful? #debatenight
Is #Trump going to stroke out before the end of the night? What a fantasi. #debatenight
My dude #LittleHands I don't think you know what the term means.  You're rambling #debatenight
Does that mean we demilitarize the police and get guns away from cops? @HillaryClinton #debatenight
NATO is reducible to paying the bills not keeping World Peace or preventing nuclear war? #DebateNight
Hillary is earning, at the very least, 3 or 4 of Meryl's Oscar's for her performance of civility tonight #debatenight
Hillary calls Trump out for not being as rich as he says he is. Goes to the heart of his image - his ego's getting crushed. #debatenight
Whoa! He just said Dems use African Americans for votes. Good for him. #debatenight
My dog literally growls every time Trump talks to long. I am a proud dog mommy #debatenight
From the the tweets I'm seeing, sounds like @debates needs an adult on the stage! #debatenight #WhereIsGary #LetGaryDebate #RiggedSystem
Shortchanging people, circumventing the system, and taking advantage of loopholes is not an working business model for a country #Debates
Random noises being made by @realDonaldTrump off-camera reason enuf 2 watch #debatenight cuz lets face it not much being said here #debates
Donald Trump on the inner cities: "You walk outside your house and you get shot". I guess I need to say my Goodbyes. #debatenight
Biggest pet peeve, being talked over. Let's have respect for one another folks... I promise it's not that hard  #debates
Trump is lecturing Clinton on racially offensive language. Well if that isn't the pot calling the kettle a thug. #debatenight
Trump keeps tying everything back to the economy as if he was even remotely coherent during that segment. #debatenight
And just when you thought he couldn't possibly insult another group of Americans, the fat shaming begins. #debates
Ding, ding, ding! There is no direct transfer of skills from business to government. Thank you, Secretary Clinton. #Debates2016 #Middling
Clinton should just stay away from these shades and attack the issues....#debates
WHY WOULD HE PIVOT FROM EMAIL BACK TO HIS TAXES. His team must be losing their mind #debatenight
Omg! Lester can't control this egomaniac. Make him STFU Lester! This is like the Republican debates where they let him ramble and lie!
It was a black lives matter protest in dallas where the cops got shot/Trump said race relations were good in Dallas b4 that? 🤔 #Debates2016
Hillary is the one who did all the work in a group project and Trump is the one who just showed up for the grade #debates
"Maybe we don't have great roads because you didn't pay income taxes" - SLAM #Debates
I don't really care about the president thing anymore. This is a temperament tournament first and foremost. #debates
Wonder if @JebBush is sitting at home like "That could've been me up there. I coulda been a contender. I coulda been somebody. #debatenight
@piersmorgan I wanted to vote for Trump, but this debate shows why R's like me can't. He's not prepared, and has no discipline. #debatenight
He hasn't given lots of thought to NATO. His views haven't changed since then. #Trump #Debates2016
@realDonaldTrump hey how's all the jobs you created in Scotland? Oh wait.... #debatenight
HE REALLY JUST SAID HE HAS A BETTER TEMPER THAN HILLARY LMFAO FOH. #debatenight
Holding my breath at this point. Trump speaks an race a minute from now. #debatenight
@PatriotKevinMO @StaceyNAlex I don't want to pay for stupid things anymore.Our grandchildren deserve us to be more responsible #debatenight
During the discussion portion of the #debatenight Watch Party here at CAL U, I will be broadcasting it live on here.
I don't like either candidate but Hilary is roasting Trump! Get it girl😂  #Debates
Cyber warfare HRC talks about. She pedals the Russians. Yes HRC the Russians may give us the 33,000emails!#debatenight
Obama could have gotten an agreement from Malaky Hillary.He chose not to. You were his Secy of State. Poor Judgment.#debatenight
So... black people are bad people. Is that what Trump is getting at? #debatenight
Audience being told not to cheer sounds a bit like the system being rigged for Hillary ***again*** #debatenight
Yes, I need Law and Order. I need Law and Order to be put on Hulu or Netflix so I can binge watch the show. #Debates2016
#Debates2016 Interrupting the moderator and refusing to stop speaking is not a display of good temperament.
Jesus Christ. How the fuck did we narrow it down to these two dinguses  #debatenight
.@HillaryClinton says she prepared for this debate and she's prepared to be president #BUNSdebate #Debates2016
Nancy Reagan is rolling over in her grave. A republican presidential candidate, coked out of his mind......smh! #debatenight
You people ate crazy! Trump is a perfect 2! His tie and teeth r amazing #debatenight
"How do you heal the divide?" -Holt #debatenight these answers will be interesting.
What is @realDonaldTrump even saying at the moment. I tuned out his jumble. #debatenight
I could've sworn Bush is the reason troops were in Iraq🤔 #Debates
Military style guns? You mean one that is black? Isn't that racist?  #debates #debatenight @scrowder
Trump thinks he knows more than Bill de Blasio on crime rates in NYC. #debates
WHY WON'T MY OPPONENT USE MY SLOGAN I STOLE FROM A CROOK? #debatenight
Trump literally just rolled his eyes at the idea of non-criminal black people. I can't with this. #debatenight
We saw a real Hillary for five seconds. Woo hoo!  Then she went back to politician. Learn to stay relatable! #Debates
RACE. Let's see what kind of fuckery he's going to say. #Debates2016
This fucker is IGNORANT as shit.. Keeps interrupting people no manners at all ..   #debatenight
Here's how to stop murders: make trump stop talking.   Sincerely, My brain cells.  #debatenight
Here's the real question, how do we bring back Harambe and prosecute the shooter of my guy. #RIPHarambe #debatenight
He can't control his anger. Doesn't that seem like a red flag?! #debatenight #DumpTrump
Can I please get a commercial break.... we all need a break from this  #debatenight
Trump says murders are up. Murders are back and now I want one. #MurderistheNewOxblood #FallFashion #Debates2016
Remember in the "The Big Short" when the screen would freeze to explain the finance jargon? I need that for Trump's remarks in #debatenight
People kill people not guns themselves... Totally agree that everyone should be vetted; on the terrorist watchlist NO GUNS 4U#Debates
Not wi Trump but Hillary is annoying..overdoing soundbites &amp;facial expressions..then again she's the exp politician #CrookedHillary #Debates
I think if you play various Sousa marches throughout the debate it enhances the experience entirely. #Debates2016
So it could've been Russia that hacked America, or possibly a 400 pound individual in his bed...? Childish @realDonaldTrump #Debates2016
A lot of you have a lot to say on Twitter rn, but will you actually utilize your voting right? #debatenight
How can any person with a brain listen to Donald Trump and want him to be the president? #Debates2016
You need to have stop and frisk? No, you need to go fuck yourself if you're seriously proposing that as a solution. #debatenight
Lester Holt better get it together he letting trump bully him #debatenight #debates
For all those playing the drinking game, BIGLY is a double  #Debates2016
"Numbers, numbers, tremendous, braggadocious, fantastic, great shape, La Guardia, third world, a report that I just saw" -DJT #debatenight
"Remember what Michelle Obama said: When they go low, we go high." -HRC  #debatenight
#Clinton wants strikes against #ISIS intensified? She seems to have forgotten attacks by American citizens in US Homeland! #debatenight
After months of following this election, I still find both candidates to be completely untrustworthy. That's a big problem. #debatenight
Trump has properties in a lot of places and he cares about Charlotte because he has property there, got it... #Debates
@MariaBartiromo @MorningsMaria @FoxBusiness There are never solutions in debates. Why leave yourself out to critique on your policy?
Lester Holt: 'Secretary Clinton?'   Clinton [smiling]: 'Whoo! Okay…'   #debatenight
Hillary Clinton is making a fool of herself tonight with all of these made up words. #debatenight #crookedhillary
Remember your mental health + well being is important. If the debate is too much, turn it off + take care of you #CripTheVote #Debates2016
Why is #Trump never asked to go first on any of the transition questions? #LesterHolt directs every new question 2 #HRC; WHY? #debatenight
The debate is already giving me headache. Trump is absolutely ludicrous. #debatenight
As an IT/CS guy, you really should be scared of China and their capabilities over most others. #DebateNight
"I have a much better temperament than she does" - Donald Trump as he continues to interrupt the moderator #debatenight
We need to increase airstrikes against ISIS? You mean the same ones that are killing thousands of innocents every year? #debates
Law &amp; Order in inner cities, stop &amp; frisk, gang violence. Is this how we deal with issues of race Donald?#blacklivesmatter #debatenight
'more stop and frisk" and "better community relations" mentioned in the same breath? smh #debatenight
Every single time Trump talks my toddler cries. Even a 2 year old knows he is a raging asshole. #debatenight
What's truly scary isn't Trump. It's the fact that voters are sitting in their homes listening to what he says and agreeing with it #debates
The argument is that people who don't understand what the argument is, can't be told, b/c they think they already know. #debatenight
"The NRA are very good people." SOS WHY IS THIS HAPPENING #DebateNight
Hey Hillary, those young men you are talking about are most likely to victims of the thugs with guns. #debatenight
I think Lester pulled a Mr. Coach Klein and went to get a hot pretzel. #debates #waterboy
#trumpOurOfControl #debatenight omg He is out of control she did release thousands of emails #Trump has released nothing
So the usual is happen: Hillary is speaking on issues and policy while Trump is talking about himself and his business #debates
No one is calling anyone at Fox News because they are clearly bias #debates
I've never seen a faker smile in my entire life than on Hillary Clinton. #debatenight
He's been saying he'll release his tax returns for months. Soooo hey what's up hello where are they???? #debatenight
Yes, policing reform is needed, but the root causes of the issue must be uncovered #Debates2016
I'm nothing even watching the debates but I know they both saying some bullshit
I hate listening to trump dance around questions he just deflects and finds a way to get back to promos #debatenight
.@realDonaldTrump "We've been working with Muslims for years and we have the greatest mess we've ever seen." #debatenight
.@HillaryClinton says she has talked to many people who have been stiffed by @realDonaldTrump. #debatenight
Now shes defending military action in the Middle East with "everyone else was doing it" #DebateNight
hillaries mini teleprompter on her eye lids is creeping me out. up and down up and down. :-D  #debates2016
End the private prisons! Young Americans are not a profit center ! #debatenight
LORDT, I'm FUCKING screaming. This birther movement is racist af jfcccc #debatenight
So far Donald has pretty much admitted to not paying federal taxes or the guy who worked on his golf clubhouse.. I mean 🤔#debatenight
Oh boy ouch 0 for the vets 0 for the military 0 for education #debatenight
How much of HRC's debate prep was just someone saying stupid shit and she had to keep a straight face? #debatenight
OMG. Did he really just brag about settling a lawsuit?? I just can't even. #debatenight #debates
So all he does is repeat stuff and say who endorses him. Ummm, what's your plan, asshat???? #debatenight
I'm confused. How is he answering the question about being a birther???? #debatenight
Clinton citing Iraq exit agreement that Bush negotiated. Such a lame argument, but it probably works anyway. #Debates
So is he endorsing cyber stalking because of what they learned from DNC hack? #distracteddonald #debatenight
What is Trump talking about? Clinton used the word "Law" 👀 #debatenight
"We are in a big fat ugly bubble." "We have a fed in the political." ...help a sista out 🤔 #debatenight #Debates2016
The Law and Order candidate! And his endorsement was from ICE (first ever endorsement of a candidate) #TrumpPence2016 #Debates2016
I see her jaw getting tighter and tighter, and she's got that pissy evil schoolmarm look. I'm sure stuff's going to fly later! #Debates2016
It really sucks that the Libertarian candidate isn't on the stage tonight, quite frankly. #Debates2016
"I cyber so cybery. I cyber bigly. Cyber so good. So much cybering, you'll be tired of cybering." -- Trump  #debatenight #debates
Clinton answered the question by not answering the question. How do we stop homegrown terrorists? Nonspecific intelligence. #debatenight
"I have much better temperament than Secretary Clinton" - possibly the most ludicrous statement of the evening #debatenight
Donald would have the smallest hands ever to touch nuclear codes :) #cbsnreax #DebateNight
I'm upset Clinton &amp; Trump haven't broken out into a dance battle. Is that not what was supposed to happen tonight? #debatenight #danceitout
Watching this debate ... @FiveThirtyEight is this the best the US has to offer ? #iswhatpeopleshouldbethinking  #debatenight
Saying "bad people" over and over again doesn't make you a good person. #debatenight
Whenever it's Hillarys time to talk Trump is like: HDKDOENDBSMS 30 years HDNALDNDBD LOUD NOISES  #Debates
Globalists punish businesses because they want to control world business.  #RedNationRising #Debates2016
I love seeing kids tweet about the debates like they know jack squat about government
"Just listen to what you heard" - pretty much all that needs to be said for his entire awful campaign. #Debates2016
Let's hope he never gets his fingers on the nuclear button. Those tiny, tiny fingers. #debatenight #debates
Is it wrong that I'm happy to see him go after her on the damn emails? #debatenight
how bout "those people" (cops) stop killing "these people" (blacks).   #debatenight
I seriously want a gallon of tomatoes to throw at the candidates. It's such a huge mess watching them bark at each other #Debates2016
He just bragged about how much money he made last year #debatenight
As long as you have a shit load of money Trump doesn't discriminate #debatenight
But honestly I am LIVING for the massive side eye Clinton gives Trump. #ImWithHer #debates
Looks like Trumps twitter account showed up to this debate tonight... #debatenight
Omg he's a liar. This shit is so easily proven. I weep for what's going to be left of this country after this election.  #debatenight
"Typical politician. All talk. No action. Sounds good. Isn't going to work." #debatenight
"The security aspect of cyber is very difficult" My brain is starting to hurt. #debatenight
Can't waiter till Lester asks  "So... do black lives matter"  #debatenight
We're supposed to be talking about  stopping terrorism in USA. #debatenight
One can't help but laugh.  This debate is going to be painful. #Trump is such a child! #debatenight
The fact that #Trump thinks he was owed a birth certificate from our president because of his race should tell you who he is #debatenight
Can we let each other finish and THEN respond? Dear lord. #debatenight
"A man who can be provoked by a tweet, should not have his hands anywhere near the nuclear codes." -@HillaryClinton YES! #debatenight
Hillary Clinton quotes Michelle Obama in a bipartisan nod to Melania Trump's RNC speech. #debatenight #ImWithHer
@ms_education completely appreciate the mention of black businesses,churches &amp; neighborhoods. Everything "minority" isn't bad #Debates2016
The United States is now a Third World Country.... #wow #debatenight @LesterHoltNBC @HillaryClinton  really Donald?!?!?
You know you have great friends when they're willing to live text the debate with you #debatenight
So he has no other talking points? What was it in the primaries about the memorized 20 second speech? #Debates2016
I'm sorry but, Donald, girl.. you need to watch more contouring videos, cause that shit ain't blended well. #DebateNight
Hillary struggling to pull enough sense out of what Trump says in order to form a rebuttal is painful. We're right there with ya #debates
#debatenight is making me sad about the future of the us over the next 4 years with 1 of these losers as president...
I wonder if @ChrisStapleton has ever considered running for president?   I'd vote for him, just because of that wicked beard #debatenight
Hillary got the hookups with those hot-n-ready pizzas from little seizures.  So, keep that in mind, folks. #debatenight
@tavleen_singh i would rather have @derekObrien debate modi. Let us put 2 scalps capable of thinking together for debates.
"He paid no federal income tax" "That makes me smart" REALLY NOW WTF #debatenight
Sued coz he would not rent out his apartments to african americans! Who does that???? Just u #trump!!! #debatenight
"I was asked on a major show*..." - Trump  * Rush Hour with Chico and The Boob; Cleveland's 3rd best morning radio show #debatenight
Can someone mute Trump's mic when HRC is answering questions? So tired of these interruptions. #debatenight
He really believes that stop and frisk is good policy for black communities. I literally don't understand. #debatenight
My goal is to do well for myself, my family, my company, and my employees. That sounds like a person I want as my president. #debates
My Halloween costume is now going to be "A Winning Temperament" #debatenight
Cause you know you can always "Say nothing" while on a Presidential Debate  #Debates #debatenight #debates2016
"The record shows that I'm right" "I don't know, who knows" What are you saying @realDonaldTrump?? #debatenight
The idea that stop-and-frisk dropped the NYC murder rate is howlingly batshit. #debates
I hate "very against police" judges. They are very against good. #debatenight
Every thing that comes out of @HillaryClinton mouth sounds like the whispers of 33,000 lost emails. #debatenight
It I behaved like this in a job interview, I don't think I'd get it. #debatenight #Debates2016
HRC's answer of race is comprehensive &amp; informed. Trump wants to profile POC across the country. Dangerous and idiotic! #debatenight
Trump says he has a "winning temperament." There is no Punchline to this. That is the punchline. #debatenight
Not gonna lie....trumps got a point there. Lots of debt, but not like everything is solved... #debates
My blood pressure is through the roof. With every single yelling interruption I take bigger sips of wine. #debatenight
I think you just criticized me for preparing for this debate. And yes I did. You know what else I prepared for? Being president #debatenight
LOOK AT HIS FACE! This is the first time he's heard about the troop withdrawal being negotiated by Bush!!!! #debatenight #Debates2016
@realDonaldTrump  Says Stop&amp; Frisk African Americans &amp; Imagrants Will Bring Law &amp; Order. #debatenight
Clinton hitting hard on birtherism but not defending herself against her own campaign's involvement in the conspiracy. #Debates2016
So Trump just admitted to committing to a NATO policy without having thought much about it. #Debates2016
Re: that last RT....if you'd told me in 2012 that I'd RT something in all seriousness Mitt Romney tweeted, I'd have cracked up #debatenight
"I didn't like the architect's work after plans were approved and the building completed so I didn't pay him" Trump paraphrased #debatenight
Police are afraid to do anything? They're not afraid to shoot black people. Just saying. #Debates
@CatholicDems @HillaryClinton I agree, but debates rarely seem to change minds, which is so depressing.
Donald Trump says $650,000,000.00 isn't a lot of money. But sure, he knows the plight of the auto worker. #Debates2016
Donald Trump's ISIS plan literally remains "we will take out ISIS." #Debates2016
Hillary should be awarded the presidency just for keeping a straight face during that 400 pounds comment. #debatenight
Hillary sometimes sounds like she's giving a state of the Union speech #debatenight
"The records says I'm right," says the Donald. But the record shows he was for Iraq. #debatenight
Every state Trump has mentioned being great in is a swing state. He's targeting these voters. #Debates2016
This is what I came for. The "Let's Get Ready to Rumble" part. #debates2016
Never thought so much shit could come out of a single person's mouth, yeah it's the one n only @realDonaldTrump #Elections2016 #debatenight
Wow, Trump has only shouted for 75% of the debate. Tremendous job. #debates
#debatenight "Just listen to what you heard"  HC says. Wonder if voters will.
If @HillaryClinton doesnt win she does have a career as a standup comic #debatenight
PURPOSELY IS NOT A WORD. what's really disgraceful having a major party candidate who can't speak proper english. #trumpsoncoke #debatenight
Trump, we didn’t forget she called our youth super predators. We just taking the lesser of 2 evils tbh #debates2016
So you telling me..bringing the troops home is the cause of ISIS ugh!! #debates2016
Take a sip every time Trump repeats a phrase and/or accuses Clinton of anything #Debates2016 #LetGaryDebate
HRC- Nuclear weapons are the #1 threat we face. REALLY? FML. #Debates
Hillary doesn't think top-down Works in America in other words bring us all down to the lowest common denominator #Debates2016
Lester Holt hits Trump with the audit lie. Trump just plows through. #debatenight
So a Trump Presidency will all about HIM getting credit ? #debates #Decison2016
"That makes me smart"... About not paying your taxes... Holy shit!!!... You're the dumbest crook on earth #debatenight
Know what's better than watching the #debate? Reading my Twitter feed #DebateNight #Debates2016 #Hilarious #WhereAreTheBindersFullOfWomen 🇺🇸
imagine looking at these two and being like "hmmm they both have very good policy ideas it's such a hard choice" #debatenight
"We're a serious debtor nation. We don't have the money because it's been squandered." Yes, by Republicans. #Debates2016
Trump - "I'm going to bring businesses back to the US." Trump - "I have many businesses outside of the US."  #Debates2016
NBC chair: Stop letting Trump actually shout over Clinton when she's responding. You're supposed to be running this debate. Thx #debatenight
So She can be a better commander in chief?? Did we forgot about Benghazi already?? American deaths because of her judgement. #debatenight
Hillary Clinton is like, the last person in all of America, who should be talking about cyber security. #debatenight #Debates2016
Trump denying supporting the war in Iraq like there isn't actual evidence of that. Lol #debatenight
It's like watching a bratty, snot-nosed kid crying for candy in the store and the mother is doing her best to not lose her mind #debatenight
GUN SAFETY REFORM FTW . I love you future Madam President #ImWithHer #debatenight
C'mon guys let trump call Sean Hannity. Isn't it time on the debate to phone a friend? #debatenight
For all the hype beforehand, a woman in a presidential debate seems totally normal until the trolls analyze it after #Debates2016
Nah. I prefer the original  Dumb And Dumber.  The one with Jeff Daniels and Jim Carrey.  #Debates2016
Trump becomes livid at the mere suggestion that it might be her turn to speak. #debatenight
Lester Holt trying to fact check Trump and Trump just plugs his ears. #debatenight
It's not even one hour in and I am out of beer.   #debates2016
Don't you bring my Ex-Boo, Bernie into this.   You keep his name out of your mouth, Don  #Debates2016
Hillary wants to sell books?  WTF?  Fuck off bitch.  And I am suppose to believe anything she says?  #debatenight #Debates2016
Want to tell a fairytale to your kids tonight for bedtime? Hillary's website! Might give 'em nightmares tho' #debatenight
What does the border control have to do with cyber security? #debatenight
Clinton is just so much MORE right than Trump on race issues that she's going to get a soft pass just for not being a monster. #Debates2016
@LesterHoltNBC NOTHING IS WHAT DT BRINGS TO THE TABLE FOR AFRICAN AMERICANS - GOING TO CHURCH FOR PHOTO OPS -NOT A RELATIONSHIP #debates2016
@HillaryClinton WITHOUT EVIDENCE TRUMP LIED ABOUT WHERE @BarackObama WAS BORN - REFUSED TO RENT TO AFRICAN AMERICANS  #debates2016
Donald Trump just demanded credit for not discriminating against African Americans. THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO DO. #debatenight
I love how Trump implies that it was Obama who got us into Iraq. Maybe he just needs a calendar. #debates #debatenight
Not paying federal taxes doesn't make you smart, it makes you a criminal #debates
Wait, did Trump just say that getting the @POTUS to release his birth certificate was a victory for racial healing? #debates
Trump: 'I have a winning temperament'...after throwing a tantrum on stage #debates
Is it me or can't @realDonaldTrump keep his mouth shut for 2mins? He's so angry it's funny #debatenight
It's weird seeing Clinton talk about criminal justice reform given all the damage her husband did when he was president #Debates2016
Either he's sick or he snorted drugs. What's with the constant sniffles? Is you ok?  #debatenight
what in the holy hell does his fetish for the birther argument have to do with ISIS? #debatenight
It's the nuclear triad question again. He has no idea what current first strike policy is. #debatenight
Is he drinking Trump Vodka?  That would explain some things. #debates
Trump: I love Charlotte  Charlotte: New phone who dis?   #debatenight #Debates2016 #clt  IB: @katlynkatiekk
Trump &amp; Hilary are both full of shit so fuck it the first one to drop an "RIP Harambe" gets my vote. #debatenight
He reminded niggaz Hillary don't fuck wit us in one statement!!! 😂😂😂 #debatenight
Man! This dude is barely holding it together.  I bet he tears up a dressing room after the debate. #supermad  #debatenight #weirdbreathing
Donny actually looks like he didn't fall face first into a tub of Party Mix tonight. #debatenight
Donald Trump says the same inaccurate shit over and over. #debates This is a waste.
At 9:34 pm EST #LesterHolt admonishes the #DebateNight audience not to interrupt...and @Fox5Shawn now owes me 25 cents on our #5at630 bet! 😜
Didn't TRump say his net worth changes every day depending upon his mood?? #ReleaseTheReturns #Debates
Can we please talk about public education?  You know, the future of our country? #debatenight #Debates2016
Trump is proud to have the endorsement of the Fraternal Order of Police, something reformers consider appalling. #Debates2016 #Debates
So... the issue with Stop and Frisk isn't that it's racial profiling, it's that immigrants shoot people. #Debates #Debates2016 #DebateNight
Again, understand that to a considerable segment of the American electorate he sounds strong &amp; compelling. Let that sink in #debatenight
Right now Hillary is using a classic, and my personal fav, using his words to make him look wrong. So money. #Debates
Like him or not but Trump is winning on the whole typical politician all talk &amp; no action rhetoric towards Hillary. #debates
On a politician level, I am cringing. But as a messy bitch who lives for drama, I have never felt so alive. #DebateNight
Think of the impact on our cities and small towns that $694 million could have #debates
Congrats to @realDonaldTrump for not discriminating at 1 club in Florida. A million gold stars and cookies for you. #debatenight
hillary looks like shes thinking "tf this bitch say about tape" #debates
#debatenight @LesterHoltNBC #BENGHAZI @realDonaldTrump What does race have to do with this election? We gave you Obama and he blew it!
Trump has daddy issues aka why he clings to Ronald Reagan 🙃 #debatenight
donald trump was supposed to be trying to get more people on his side by acting civil for once.. He's doing a horrible job😂😂😂 #debates
Make America great again?¿ More like make America a joke again! #DebateNight
the fact that donald trump seems to think global warming isn't happening is sooooo insane to me!! how did he even get this far #debatenight
BOOM GOES THE DYNAMITE!!! Good on you @HillaryClinton 🌋 God bless America! #debatenight #debates
Yup I did prepare for the debate just like a prepared for the presidency #shotsfired #Debates2016
'Our country's being ripped off by every country in the world' Trump. What? #Debates2016
#debatenight #Debates2016 #debates   Hillary with this constant happy happy wacko face...  Be a good boy Lester, start the clock again..
Does he have to say the same thing over and over again just in different ways #DebateNight
both of these candidates have ugly histories with race relations and i don't trust them for a minute #debatenight
Put me in coach. I can do this "debate" thing too. #DebateNight
Oh my God! every time Trump knows he's wrong he does the kissy face 😂 #DebateNight
Not paying federal tax: "That makes me smart." -Trump.   #PresidentialDebate #debatenight
Is a 400 pound hacker more dangerous than 200 pound hacker ? #todaysquestiontoanonymous  #Debates
Can the phrase "Over the last little while" please be our biggest take-away from this? #debatenight #debates #Debates2016
Knew it was coming the Chicago talk, black on black crime he played to the white supremacist cheap seats! #debates
The is the most Trump has ever acted like a drunk homeless man talking to himself on the subway ever #DumpsterFire2016 #Debates2016
The audio on the ABC online feed isn't doing a lot to dispel the Hillary robot conspiracies #debatenight
#debatenight @realDonaldTrump we get it, you're ahead of time and under  budget
Hey ladies, ever had a man lecture you loudly about your temperament while you sat there keeping calm? #debatenight #ImWithHer
Did he just say "bigly?" This is a real presidential candidate... #debatenight
He just needs to acknowledge being wrong and apologize for it. Take the L! #debatenight
My teen son: "Why is Secretary Clinton blinking so much?" Me: "Because she's lying dear." #Debates #Trump
Clinton seems so fake when she talks and Trump seems like an absolute dick. How are these people the Presidential candidates? #DebateNight
The first factual thing Trump has said tonight: "Nobody wants to call Sean Hannity." #debatenight
Okay I'm done! #debatenight I have a black friend ... can't do it anymore Goodnight Twitterville
Trump is such a petulant child. If you're going to interrupt, at least have something to add to the conversation. #debates
The problem with Trump's claim that crime is up is that it isn't. #peskyfacts #Debates2016
Trump's only argument is that politicians have made mistakes in the past and he is not a career politician. #debatenight
OMG he refers to Obama as "your president" He's YOUR president too Trump. #debates
I love this drama. Better be up for an Emmy next year #DebateNight
#Debates2016 Stop interrupting U orange turd burglar! U have sacrificed nothing and R so unqualified to even breathe the same air as us!
If the debate isn't boring for young audiences, then there's something wrong. There's something wrong about this debate. #Debates
LMAOO Howard Stern getting shout outs on a Presidential Debates? Aight i'm done here
T: "I will say this:  we have a situation in this country that has to be taken care of."  #Debates2016 #FCNLive
Um....did Trump just do a shameless plug for a business he's starting?  This guy. #Debates2016 #FCNLive
Maybe it was a 400 lb Russian 10-yr-old trying to fix the cyber #debates #debatenight #PresidentialDebate
All races KILL EACH OTHER BRUH. Black people are NOT  the only ones to kill their own race. Period EVER. #debatenight #Debates2016
"We're in a big, fat, ugly bubble" couldn't agree more  #DebateNight
While the candidates talk about guns, nine people shot in Houston. #Debates2016
Trump wants to put his 10 yr old in charge of cyber security!!! Lol #DEBATES2016
Will someone please give @realDonaldTrump some oxygen? He seems to be struggling to catch his breath. #Debates2016 #MAGA #DumpTrump
This is a brother/sister fight on who REALLY wrecked dad's car #debatenight
@HillaryClinton Just admitted blacks &amp; latinos have been a complete target to the prison system, &amp; controls need to be checked. #Debates2016
#DonaldTrump is getting as red as #HillaryClinton's outfit. He'll keel over before he gets to renegotiate those trade deals. #debatenight
Did Trump just attempt to take credit for Obama releasing his birth certificate? #debatenight
What will the polling show tomorrow and later this week? 48% for Clinton and 46% for Trump prior to #debates #debatenight #CBUS110
Trump's face... "who are these people/groups she's talking about?" "Oh, I know ISIS... let's do that one" #Debates2016
Clinton is destroying Trump in this debate. She's laying out solid plans, trump repeats himself and runs around answers. #Debates2016
#debates2016 Trump is very difficult to listen to, and almost as difficult to watch!!!
He has literally not made a single legitimate fucking policy proposal #debatenight
Well maybe he didn't do a good job so I won't pay him. THAT'S NOT HOW IT WORKS!!! #debatenight
So @realDonaldTrump is now lying again and saying Clinton started the Birther movement. Not true. #debates #debatenights.
How does a man running for president think it makes him "smart" to pay no federal taxes ??? #debates
Damn, Hillary actually calling Trump on his record of "engaging in racist behavior"  #debates
How is it not standard practice to mute the non-speaking party during the #Debates?
TRUMP IS PUTTING THE BLAME OF WHAT HAPPENED IN CHARLOTTE ON ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS OKKAYYYYYY #debatenight
Those who avoid service have no respect for the military, and sling BS with talk of respecting what you weren't willing to do. #debatenight
Systemic racism &amp; implicit bias. When have those been talked abt in presidential #debates? Thank u #BLM &amp; all fighting 4 racial justice
Trump has the look of a man that wants to throw a punch... #debates
Noone wants to hear a city that you "love and have investments" keep your money out of this. Let it just be the city you love. #debatenight
He's paid nothing.  "Zero for troops, zero for vets, zero for schools."  #debates #imwithher
Why this racist phuck @realDonaldTrump keep sniffling like he's about to drop! Debate just started. Dude aint got no stamina. #DebateNight
Acknowledging the need to keep weapons away from known terrorists is the one and only sensible thing Trump has said all night #debatenight
Am I the only one that sees the questions as being biased against Donald Trump? Ridiculous! #Debates
@LesterHoltNBC I think lester doin a good job he letting them go #Debates2016
You also have endowments from the KKK. Go the fuck home! #debates
Stop and frisk was not a success. Google it y'all. It encouraged racial profiling. #debatenight
@TODAYshow @CNNPolitics #Debatenight I really hope other countries don't get to watch this. Shameful. Classless. #whathappenedtomanners #sad
@realDonaldTrump "I settled with no admission of guilt" so clearly I wasn't ACTUALLY racist. #debatenight
It's even worse than my country's debate last year, took me 2 minutes to lose it. #debatenight
I have absolutely no idea what #Donny just said. But I can't wait to join this club. Most clubs don't let Hippos in.  #debatenight
I don't have to wait until this debate ends. #SheWon! If you agree, retweet! #Debates2016
Dear Donald, stop and frisk was deemed unconstitutional. Does not matter to you? #debates
@HillaryClinton: Want to see private prisons ended in the federal AND state system #StrongerTogether #ImWithHer #debates
Not a fan of Trump really in any way, but he is taking Hillary to the wood chipper right now. I think he might be winning this. #debatenight
Criminal justice reform is code speak for a rollback to the Crime Bill and Welfare Reform efforts of the 90s. @HillaryClinton #debates
Stop and frisk isn't the only way to reduce crime @DonaldTrump. And STOP using #Chicago as an example. Go back to #NYC. #debates
Trump always tryna disrespect Obama. like Obama won't run that fade #Debates
.@realDonaldTrump to Hillary: "you brought up the term 'super predator' about black youth..." #debatenight
.@HillaryClinton on Trump: "he has a long record of engaging in racist behavior" #debatenight
Everyone buckle up Trump is about to get even more white #race #debatenight
What Law &amp; Order is Drumpf talking about? The show?? I don't understand what he's talking about. Does he? #debatenight #Debates2016
Trump has now said America is not as good as Russia, Dubai (not a country) Qatar and China. #Debates2016
Alright we'd like the replacement candidates to come to the national #debates. #nottrump #neverhillary
#ISIS formed from of al Qaeda in #Iraq. It didn't just appear after US forces left. But #Trump also thinks Obama founded ISIS so.. #debates
@artiequitter wtf, Artie. I'm watching the debates and Trump just referenced the stern interview you did with him.
#debatenight   Living up to the hype so far. So glad i'm off to watch this shit show.
Trump has a lot of good things to say but he has a poor way of delivering his message #Debates
Hillary: I have a feeling by the end of this I'll be blamed for everything   Trump: why not! This is the best thing said yet #debatenight
Donald, the only thing you know about taxes is how not pay your fair share #debatenight
The audience laughed when Trump said he has a "winning temperament". Yikes. #debates
Oh good Christ if this whole debate is about Trump's personal finances and Clinton's emails I guess it's all we deserve #debatenight
At this rate Trump is going to call Hillary the c word by the end of tonight.  #debatenight
Is it just me or is one candidate getting pressed a little harder than the other? #debatenight
I have a better temperament than her, says the maniac on stage. #debatenight
The debates are so fun to watch, not because I know a god damn thing about politics but who doesn't like watching 2 old rich people argue?
How many liberals has Trump offended by saying blacks and Hispanics live in a “war-torn country”? #debatenight
Lester was tying sooooo hard to get trump to answer the question #debates
I'm surprised it took a half-hour for it to devolve into minor chaos. #debates
No you wont be blamed for everything just what you and your husband have actually lied about or destroyed #Debates
#Debates2016 Trump has been using that same excuse since the beginning. Just release them already, man!!!!!
She just admitted to the 33,000 emails so why isn't the FBI up on stage arresting her right now?!? #Debates2016
"wrong"  "wrong"  "wrong"  Wow, glad you cleared that up Donald #debatenight
#debatenight ~ Trump isn't AL SHARPTON, if he owed one thin dime, Obama would've had him in jail years ago.
#debatenight ~ schools failing &amp; riots breaking out in inner cities but Hillary thinks things are fine &amp; dandy?! Wtf?!
Trumps idea to have NATO finally focus on terrorism! Not her! #Debates2016
@RyanLizza Banks settled without admission of guilt. They all do it and it doesn't mean they're innocent #Debates2016
What does either answer have to Do with race in America #debatenight
Hillary in red and Donald in blue. Shouldn't it be the other way around? #debatenight
Hillary has always been about policy, she know her policy. Donald has always been about himself, he only cares for himself. #Debates2016
Trump:Obama and Senetor Clinton caused ISIS and we should have taken the oil  Me:Yes they caused ISIS not us attacking for oil #debatenight
"inner cities"= I think we all can guess what that's code for. #debatenight
$650 million is not a lot of money yet we need a president who knows about money #debatenight #trumpiscrazy
I love how Trump has to name drop in the debate... so childish. #DebateNight
"How do you fix race relations" "All of the police endorse me. All of them" #debates2016
That implicit bias line, though largely true, hurt Hillary. The white fragility in the US ain't having that. #debatenight
Listening to this man talk around the questions and talking points is giving me an aneurism #debatenight
Did he just confirm that there is a fraternal order of police  Did he let that slip#debates
Everyone over 400lbs should be fucking furious - as if those dealing with obesity don't have enough judgement to deal with. #debates
I'm not smart and all I can think is why these politicians are talking more about playground jabs than shit that makes sense?  #debatenight
.@realDonaldTrump You are missing a ton of opportunities to hit @HillaryClinton hard on her nonsense, but good job. #debatenight #1210debate
@donlemon 😂😂 So true. Me too. One of the few times my TV is on. #debatenight #debates
"I won't release my tax returns until she releases her 33 thousand deleted emails" #Debates2016
Trump says his business savy is what our country needs. Avoids tax issues complains about emails.... Trumps bait &amp; switch. #debatenight
Is someone going to ask Trump about the USFL during this debate? #debatenight
#Debates Hey @realDonaldTrump ISIS was created under Bush &amp; not under Obama. And you are a big liar.
Stupid Trump is stupid. LAW AND ORDER movement!?  REALLY!?!  #debatenight
LaGuardia is a craphole, I think both Democrats and Republicans can agree #debates
You have a much better temperament? @realDonaldTrump then stop interrupting Lester  #Debates
He has a much better temperament? My 12-year-old daughter who has bouts of anger behaves better than this #asshat #debatenight
If you don't learn a lot from tax returns, tiny hands should release them #ReleaseTheReturns #ImWithHer #Debates2016
So...we need more police shootings in Chicago? The police in Chicago have called him a liar #ImWithHer #Debates2016
All I hear Trump say is "I'm racist. I'm racist. I'm racist" #debatenight #Debates2016 #ImWithHer
Hillary is playing damage control and Trump is... well... Trump is being Trump. #Debates2016
Tell us something we dont know already about race relations please #debatenight
Did Donald just say that Baron is a Cyber? I'm so confused. #Debates2016
Wait, didn't Bush get us into Iraq?  Bc I'm pretty sure Barack was still kickin it in his dashiki back then. #debates2016
Every time @realDonaldTrump is required to answer with facts I'm forced to try and decipher WHAT he's saying. #debatenight #stumpedbytheverb
This debate is like when a sitcom does a memory lane episode because the writing got stale. Emails, Taxes. #debatenight
I live in #nyc and the streets are NOT safe! My family gets followed by mentally ill people and it is unnerving #Debates2016
Trump should spend a week in a third world country... maybe he'll think twice about it before comparing it to the United States #Debates
Its like he's giving a class presentation on a book he didn't read. #debatenight
#debatenight narcissistic personality he can't help himself,showing bulling signs. Stop praising yourself and tell us real solutions
Flip flopping Hillary strikes again!  Does she even keep track of her own positions?  #Debates2016 #hillaryforprison #realdonaldtrump
" We need law and order in a country . " 🙄🙄🙄🙄 #Debates2016
Do I also need to be coked out to understand what he's saying? #debatenight
"Why not?"  I was wearing a tank top but I had to throw on a parka because that was ICE COLD #debatenight
Well now I'm scared of the hole to the center of the earth that that mic drop made.  #debatenight
Lester is trying but Trump doesn't have answers so he literally CAN'T answer the questions.  #debatenight
Supply side economics are the reason the Clinton years were prosperous #debatenight
Of course @HillaryClinton immediately thinks of guns when she is asked about race relations. #debatenight
Clinton said "Our police are outgunned". They have too many or they don't? #debatenight
#GoodnightEveryone in #RVA &amp; #Twitterland! 😴 The back of my eyelids are more entertaining than  #debates !  #Debates2016 #Trump4president
Did this dude say it makes him smart not to pay federal taxes? #debatenight
That was a really smooth segway from Birth Certificates to defeating ISIS. #debates #WhereIsGary stop this madness!
Trump suggests stop and frisk then veers off to illegal immigrants #debates
I'm truly inspired by Hillary's strength and restraint by not visibly cringing every time Trump snivels. #debatenight
@Deadspin "I was sued for racist practice and settled but never admitted to being a racist! I'm such a good person!" #Debates
Trump: "The Fed is being more political than Secretary Clinton" because it's keeping interest rates low. #debates #debatenight #debates2016
Am I just imagining this, or is HRC having problems talking in the #Debates2016 ? #TYTlive
"does the eagles have a chance to go the super bowl this year?"#debatenight
Trump just strings from dog whistle to dog whistle, rambling all the way through. #DebateNight
Why won't he release his tax returns? Because they're his own damn business and they're under audit. #debatenight
The 2nd amendment still stands and the promblem isnt banning guns, it is banning the people who have comitted crimes and want guns #Debates
My one hour for this #DebateNight is up. I will look for reviews later but truth be told, we simply can't predict how Americans will vote 💁
realDonaldTrump: This is the simple fact about HillaryClinton: she is a typical politician - all talk, no action. #Debates2016
If she's all talk then what does that make Trump? An make up caked bag of wind? #debatenight
I believe a million people just googled the word #Braggadocious and thought "wow...that is a word" #debatenight
Can they give Trump a diff question like how many blk friends does he have? I have no desire to hear his commentary on race #debatenight
Debate Matt Fact: Lester Holt is as in control as a substitute teacher. #debatenight
If @realDonaldTrump has so many assets over seas, why doesn't he bring those businesses back to America first? Lead by example #debates
Hm, flying into LAX this weekend - I’ll see if I can survive the disease and pestilence in that 3rd world environment. #Debates2016
APPARENTLY it's okay to not pay someone if you're "not satisfied" with their work and the US should follow that #debatenight
If an audit is the problem then why doesn't IRS finish up the audit? #debatenight 🚂🇺🇸🇺🇸🚂💨
If you squint, the #debatenight icon looks like a mixed drink of some sort...which will be needed to watch this whole thing...
#debates #DebateNight Oh blast, I am out of popcorn to throw at Hillary.  Ate half, threw half, not a bad debate average!!
The authenticity thing is hilarious to me. Both candidates are pandering. The question is who's pandering to you. #Debates2016
American citizens offer a sincere apology to the iconic series @nbcsvu for this uncomfortable mention! #debates
So you're going to get good community relations by singling out and badly treating minorities through stop and frisk ... right #debatenight
Nukes are no longer the greatest threat to the world unless the US decides to use them #debatenight
Everything Donald is saying basically boils down to "I gets money." #debatenight
"I filed a statement of sorts." That's why he doesn't need to show us his tax returns. #debates
can we keep a tally of how many times trump interrupts hillary #debates
Trump - I would like to phone a friend (Hannity) if I may Regis. #debatenight
Wtf? You're comparing our national debt to AIRPORTS?? I would rather have a nicer AIRPORT THAN ECONOMY?? #debatenight
Infrastructure is irrelevant if people are murdered for existing with higher levels of melanin. #Debates2016
"Stop &amp; frisk was determined to be unconstitutional, in part because it was ineffective." #hillaryism #debatenight
'No wonder you've been fighting ISIS your entire adult life' 💀💀💀 #debatenight
Trump is using buzzwords and scare tactics to rally his followers and play on their hatred #showusreceipts #debatenight
Random thought. Maybe we can just stop fucking selling guns to anyone who wants one.... #Debates2016
When guns are taken out of the criminal's hands, @DonaldTrump, then cops would be disarmed. #Debates2016 #PresidentialDebate
Hillary has the look of a mother who just had to let her toddler scream himself right into his nap. #debatenight #debates #Debates2016
"Please let me respond, Lester, I have important insights we all need into the African American community." #debatenight
"Sidney Blumental reporter 2011 jobs I actually helped African Americans and Obama you're welcome." #debatenight
Clinton gets third applause of night when she says she prepared for this debate and she's prepared to be president #debatenight
Clinton gets audible laughter with #birther line after Trump's time: 'Just listen to what you heard' #debatenight
Still hurts like heck to hear my hometown as the site of a terrorist attack 💔 #OrlandoStrong #DebateNight
Y'know, when Drumpf starts to sputter, he really gets into this Jackie Mason kind of mode. #debates
You know that guy who treats live debates like a middle school argument?   Yeah?   Let's send him to negotiate with world leaders!   Great!
100k or more ppl w/ @TWC and @DIRECTVService lost live feed in Charlotte NC #Wow #Debates
#debatenight #debate. Ask about the Clinton Foundation, who gives money for influence, about Soros guiding Clinton to do what he wanted
Did trump just say it was his idea for NATO to fight terrorists ? #debatenight
nobody can interrupt the person they're debating that much and claim that they have a better temperament #Debates
"I prepared for President...and I think that's a good thing" - @HillaryClinton   BOOM. #debatenight #Debates2016 #debates
I thought we learned "Wait Your Turn" in kindergarten. If it's not your 2 minutes, SHUT UP. #debatenight
It doesn't matter what your race is, if you're a criminal then you're a goddamned criminal. #debatenight
It's easy to be under budget when you don't pay your workers. #debatenight
Any black person that votes for Trump with him promoting Stop and Frisk is cancelled. #debatenight
If I wanted people selling me BS between plays I would tune into #MondayNightFootball @ESPNMondayNight  c'mon @LesterHoltNBC #Debates
So now @ICEgov, a US government agency at @DHSgov, has "endorsed" Trump?! C'mon!! This is gobbledygook! #debatenight #TertuliaHillaryvsTrump
Bragadocious? Bragedosious? New words tumbling out of Donald Trump's mouth - creative or crazy? You decide #debatenight
i will say this for trump, he looks less orange tonight #debatenight
"They were taunting us!!!" What we need in a @POTUS is a man who has a 5 year's old "They started it!" mentality. #debatenight #disturbing
I'm not sure Trump could look more disgusted that a woman is speaking. #debatenight
Wait. Did he just say "that means I'm smart," to a comment about not paying taxes on the casinos? #debatenight
But it was the republicans and Bush that GOT America into Iraq. #debatenight
So did Trump's team purposely crash their website because they knew the fact checking would be in Hillary's favor? 😂 #debatenight #ImWithHer
Enough about the emails and tax returns, HEY WE'RE AMERICANS, HOW ABOUT US? WHAT ABOUT US? #Debates
Trump "thinks" he has a good relationship with African-Americans.Should be focusing on the Hispanics Trump #debatenight #alhsgov
I guess Hil wore all red because she knew this would be a bloodbath and didn't want to stain any other pantsuit? #lit #debatenight
Whew. I'm really on the fence here on who to vote for. #NoImNot #debates
Clinton: "He started his political activity based on this lie that our first black president was not a US citizen." #debatenight
Trump: "I have much better judgement than she has ... I also have a much better temperament than she has." The audience laughs. #debates
I like that Hillary is wearing red. I think she's trying to convey a message #debatenight
Is it just me or is Trump the only one speaking? #DebateNight
lester holt slowly realizing that a life dedicated to journalism has lead to this shit #debatenight
Oh gosh...they need to change the moderator for the next set of debates. #debatenight
#debates  who cares about tax returns &amp; emails. I have variable rate student loans, lets return to interest rates &amp; higher wages discussion
#debates still undecided but who cares cuz Russia is gonna hack the election anyway lol 😏
Donald Trump got all his knowledge of African American struggles from the man that he hired to be his chauffeur. #debates #debatenight
How much am I supposed to tip debate moderator for being good pushover #debatenight #LesterHolt
"See you later. I'll see you in four years. " -Trump in four years #fuckthatguy #Debates2016 #debatenight
Important discussion regarding implicit bias - not just in police force but everywhere. #Debates2016
Trump "I have much better judgement than she has, and I have much better temperament than she has! #debatenight where r the fact checkers?!
What about the Latinos ??? It's not just the blacks.  #debatenight
U did support the war idiot... there's a soundbite from howard stern!! Then hannity was ur way of backpedaling! ! #debatenight
Trump goes in for "law &amp; order". Reminder: He's a fan of fascism. #Debates2016
"it could be someone who's 400lbs sitting on their bed--" what do I have to do with this and why is Trump vaguing me #debatenight
Trump's grammar is atrocious... as if I didn't already dislike him. #DebateNight
Trump admits he would fire at Iranian ships for taunting. Says "no it wouldn't (start a war)."  #debatenight #Iran
This orange brute just defended birtherism in a segment on "racial healing". What planet am I on? #debatenight
The only thing "tremendous" about #debatenight is the volume of fact checking going on.
Lester keeps trying not to giggle but when you're faced with that level of lunacy... #debatenight
#Debates ask Trump about his companies who make items outside our country
@DayDaVonne_ #debates I live in Canada and I am worried about Donald Trump!!
YOU HAVE 2 MINUTES TO SOLVE RACISM  GO!!!!!  #debatenight  #debates
Every single thing has ultimately come back to money. One dimension candidate, not to mention inept maniac. #Debates2016
$650 mil is not a lot of money!? Who is out of touch here? #debatenight
#Debates2016 Donald Trump doesn't read --he just says what Steve Bannon tells him to say
#Debates2016 "At least I have a plan to fight ISIS"-- "she's been fighting ISIS her whole adult life"-- WTF?! He just blew a gasket
If you want to get on to things, why did you dwell on the birth certificate for 5 years? #Debates2016
"I've developed very very good relationships over the last LITTLE WHILE with the African American community...." What?!? #debatenight
@realDonaldTrump : Tens of Thousands of People Love Me. An acoustic guitar album releasing December 4th. #debatenight
How are you going to make "America great again"when you can't even avoid staying out of the court because people love suing you #debatenight
And Donald says not paying his federal taxes makes him smart?!?! |Face palm| #debatenight
OMG, some one who is on the bed and weigh 400 lbs??? #Nerds #debatenight #debates #HackersAreObese?
Might be LGA RT @ComplexMag: Serious question....  What's the sh*ttiest airport in the U.S.? #WorstAirport #DebateNight
I am not sure what scares me more, these 2 running for President or the tweets about the debate. #Debates
Hillary just SCHOOLED drumpf. BAHAHAHAHA "I also prepared to be president" *cheers* #ImWithHer  #debatenight
We're talking about racial healing. What do you have to say? "I say Nothing." #ImWithHer #Debates
I take advantage of the laws... Aka ripping off you suckers. #debatenight
Realize your birth certificate Donald since you think that's a requirement #debatenight
It was smart for trump to pivot to BERNIE supporters to remind them of how Debbie rigged the primaries #debatenight
Can we rewind a couple years and figure out what we did wrong to let Donald Trump and Hilary Clinton to be the final 2?? #DebateNight
"I got him to produce the birth certificate. Just like she can't bring back jobs, she can't produce." HMM. #debatenight
Hillary be like "the constitution? Fuck that shit! Let's nix 1st, 2nd and 4th amendments to start" #debatenight
Only took 15 minutes for him to start losing his cool #debates #Debates2016
AT LEAST HILLARY IS TELLING US WHAT SHE WANTS TO DO WHAT IS TRUMP TALKING ABOUT #Debates
trump is that uncle at thanksgiving dinner that interrupts all your stories #debatenight
trump thinks he's slick by calling her secretary clinton like that's all she's gonna be 💀 #debatenight
Trump ruined the old post office for the average person. Now only rich folks can afford to go there. I used to love it, not now #debatenight
Donald wants to complain about black-on-black crime without using that phrase. #tytlive #debatenight
Why hasn't Clinton mentioned David Duke or how every white supremacist came out of the woodwork to endorse him. #tytlive #debatenight
@joshgad I think you asked before if we were scared, the answer is yes... effing terrified #debates
.@realDonaldTrump~ "Our country is suffering because people like Sec. Clinton have made such bad decisions." #debatenight  #debates
What was this (new?) gesture of passing the finger of his lips, when Hillary used the still missing "tax returns"? Getting nervous? #Debates
His temperament?? Like a thermometer next beside an open flame. Very healthy!! #Debates
Secretary Clinton had all the chances in the world to defeat ISIS, she failed miserably.  #debatenight #debates #PresidentialDebate #Hillary
Trump so unhappy to not be able to talk over a woman #debatenight
Really, the woman who emailed from a unsecured personal server stored in a bathroom is yapping about Cyber Security? 🙄  #DebateNight
"I have a great company." Which company Trump, your vodka, steaks, or university? #Debates2016
If we were better than everyone else, why would Trump ask Russia to hack her? #Debates2016
Trump said "the Fed" (aka Janet Yellen) is more political than Clinton. #Debates2016
"Well, just listen to what you heard." Clinton with the statement that captures the ENTIRE debate. #Debates2016
Once the nuclear happens, we'll be wishing we had the cyber on our side. #debatenight
DONALD WHAT ARE YOU SAYING?! YOU SHOULD NOT BE PROUD OF THIS #debatenight
i'm not understanding why trump is so angry. is he angry because she's smarter? or because she's more prepared? #debatenight
.@LesterHoltNBC One of the most unfair debates I have EVER seen in my life! You pushed back on Trump, never Clinton. Her air time 3 to 1. BS
I will not bring up old feelings, I will not bring up old feelings, I will not bring up old feelings #dncleak #debatenight
Speaking of paying fair shares. How much did you pay in taxes? #debates
Hillary started the whole thing of Obama not being born in America... #Debates
Why wont @HillaryClinton release how much money Wall Street and Saudia Arabia are investing in her? #debatenight
We can always trust the super wealthy to give money to the rest of us. For sure. #debatenight #trump
We're doomed if #Trump doesn't figure out how to shut his mouth and quit interrupting.  #debatenight
We can't bring back Law &amp; Order Donald. It wouldn't be the same without Jerry Orbach. #debatenight #ImWithHer
"That makes me smart" would be written on the tombstone of any normal presidential candidate. #Debates2016
why is Don still trying to make "stop and frisk" happen? it's not going to happen #meangirls #debatenight
Trump basically admits he's not running ads against Hillary because he's cheap. #debates
What the hell good is Lester Holt? This is a free for all. #debatenight
Did a nominee for president just literally say that not paying taxes makes him smart???? #debatenight
Maybe our infrastructure would be better if you paid taxes on your $694 million dollars of income you sack of shit #debatenight
psssst Donald if you have to tell the debate audience that you're smart then it probably means you're not #debates
"I will show my tax returns when Obama shows his birth certificate....". That was 5 years ago. So. uh. Where are they, dude? #debatenight
Trump, honey. You supported the war in Iraq. Right. Right. Right. #debatenight @realDonaldTrump
We've heard the #lawandorder argument before and we know how it turns out for communities of color. #debatenight
Trump "I opened a club... in what's probably the wealthiest community in the world." Clearly reaching out to the average voter #debatenight
Y'all really gonna let her be 2 faced on national news, everyone knows Hilary went after Obama 08 and now all of a sudden it's cool #Debates
For the love of God I hope none of you are drinking everytime you hear #ImpulsiveDonald blurt out "Wrong!"#DebateNight
next debate can we just have the candidates cut promos in the middle of a wrestling ring? #debatenight
Hillary thinks radical muslims have ALLAHU AKBAR written in their foreheads or something, huh? #debatenight
What does your 10 year old son have to do with cyber security? Because he can operate a computer and you can't? Congrats. Gold star #Debates
This debate is funny! Trump is not holding back &amp; it's kind of entertaining #debatenight
Hilary talks about Trump stiffing biz on money she should be worried about the amount of people her husband has stiffed in bed #debatenight
We're talking about a huge racial divide in a "post racial" society. Good job Obama. #debatenight
Does anyone else wanna give this whole campaign thing a shot? #debatenight
taxes and race relations right off the bat ....   this is good   #debatenight
teachers are telling me to watch the debate to learn something, but im just getting dumber fam :( #debatenight
And why won't the lawyers let him release his tax returns..? #debates
When will they get to the real issues? IS JOE FLACCO ELITE OR NAH!? #debatenight
Narcissism on display.  Speak loudly and believe your own lies.  #Debates2016
This is the sideshow that the 7-person GOP debates deprived us of. Trump having to try and talk substance.
"I settled that lawsuit with no admission of guilt" aka I paid them off. #crook #debates
Trump: "I have a much better temperament than she does" ARE YOU KIDDING #debatenight
"If I blew up some sailors in the water, that wouldn't start a war." - @realDonaldTrump #debatenight
Good strategy by @HillaryClinton  Smile and let him dig his own hole! #debatenight
I'm just imagining a bunch of midgets with building on their backs now. #thankshillary #debatenight
That's IT!? Hillary Clinton's last tweet before #DebateNight is SO inspiring ... oh wait, not it's not
You usually have to pay money to watch monkeys throw poo at each other at the zoo. Incredible that this is free. #debates
just a thought but didn't most of trump's businesses go bankrupt??? #debates
Okay need to watch SNL Saturday because this is going to be great.  #debatenight
I went to the bathroom and now I have no idea what's going on. #Debates2016
@realDonaldTrump advocating for what he calls "law &amp; order." Hitler would have done the same thing my friend #debates
@CalebShomo the "law and order" in effect for these debates are already exposing his inability to tackle/understand issues in America.
Clinton &amp; Trump have to been the biggest trolls of 2016 #debatenight
Lester " we need to move on" trump - no no wait it's very important " #Debates2016
trump: "bring back law and order" soooooooo being shot,suspected, searched for being black... #debatenight
Trump doesn't have a foundation to hide his money in, like you do Hillary!#debatenight
Waiting for Holt to go after Clinton like he's going after Trump #Debates
I'd take a drink every time Trump interrupts Hillary, but I like living. #debates
Everything from trump is related to his business success! nothing for the people! #afterthought #debatenight
Thanks Hillary, Implicit Bias is everywhere not only in the police. #debates
Even if Hillary Clinton hulked out right now she would still be less belligerent than Donald Trump. #debatenight
Did she say we will squeeze isis In Syria or I'm hearing things 😂 #debatenight
I dig what Hillary is saying but I need her to call a spade a damn spade &amp; stop dancing around what's being asked #debatenight
"I have the backing of the FOP."   That's not enough, sir? #debatenight
Donald Trump has a very limited vocabulary. He uses the same words over and over. #debatenight
I'll vote Hillary if she takes away my student loan debit! Sorry, kinda sorry!#debatenight
@AlexfromPhilly @HuffPostLive Watching a white man scream lies over a black man and a woman to win an argument. (via @draecampbell) #debates
Just need Hilary Clinton to score a touchdown so i can win my fantasy match up this week #debatenight #MNF
"I'll release my tax returns when Hillary Clinton releases her 33,000 emails" #Debates2016
The point 📍                                          Trump. 🏌  #Debates2016
All this swinging from hysterical laughter to shock and despair is giving me whiplash. #debates
What part of "stop and frisk" being unconstitutional does he not understand?! @draiochta14 #debatenight
I've never seen a human being exhibit more patience than #HillaryClinton is on this debate stage. Trump is a TOTAL wreck.  #debatenight
Crazy Network Ratings Idea: Jed Bartlett, Mack Allen, Selina Meyer, Frank Underwood, &amp; Thomas J Whitmore debate #debatenight #LetGaryDebate
Lester Holt has about as much control over this debate as I do. (Actually, I have more thanks to my remote's mute button!) #debatenight
This debate is more civil than I thought it would be.  Is that more disturbing or less?  #debates
How the fuck can terrorists get guns? How is political stagnation and the inability of congress to do anything a topic at the #debatenight
If he says great, unbelievable or tremendous one more time ... #DebateNight
Ok 30 minutes in and here we are talking about those fucking emails. #debatenight
Maybe he'll be able to answer a question if he didn't interrupt everyone #Debates2016
"I think Trump just criticized me for preparing for this debate. I did prepare. I also prepared to be President."Hillary ftw.🙌🏻 #debatenight
Stop hating on laguardia. It's definitely better than a third world country. #DebateNight
When did #Trump say the IRS told him he couldn't release his taxes? He simply said he didn't want to until after the audit #debatenight
@realDonaldTrump basically revealed that he built a hotel on Pennsylvania Ave so he will live in DC win or lose. #Debates2016
Does this debate have commercials? I need to get up and get a 🍸 #debatenight
the lowest WWE #Raw rating in years due to the greater circus on TV right now via #debates
LAUGH LINE OF THE NIGHT: "I have a much better temperament than she does." #Debates2016
The camera almost snagged a shot of Lester Holt updating his LinkedIn page #Debates2016
Hillary on race . Blah blah blah blah . Trust . Relations . Respect . Blah blah . #debatenight #Debates2016
Stop pointing your finger like an upset school child Mr. Trump #debatenight
"I get audited every year" I don't think that's helping your case bud. #debatenight #chapter11
What Donald Trump you were endorsed by Ice or ISIS 😂 #Debates
I need more drinks and cheesecake if I'm getting through the rest of this #debatenight
Didnt think this campaign could be worse than Bush jr and Kerry, but here we are #debates
The solution to gun use is so black and white I dont understand what this need for stop and frisk is #debates
Can someone PLEASE do a supercut of all of @hillaryclinton's knowing smiles during these rants? #Debates2016
HRC is maintaining so much grace in the face of the shitnado she has to debate. How are they sharing the same stage #Debates
"As far as the nuclear is concerned...." Is that pronounced like George W, NOOCLER? #debates #Trump
Maybe it's because it's 2:45am here but my head is mashed listening to that oaf.   Race relations next. This isn't gonna end well #debates
Wasn't the guy who shot 9 people in Houston an attorney? Would you stop and frisk him?  #Debates2016
@clinton_trump16  Sneak in with a giant bendy straw and suck it out to a waiting ship off shore, duh... #Debates2016
Trump twitched when Hillary mentioned equal pay for woman. Hardly think he can wrap his head around systemic racism. #debates
Seriously turn off the mic if protocol gets broken. What the hell is the point of a moderator? #debates
#Debates2016 after talking about law and order Trump says Hillary won't mention law and order... Are we at the same debate?
@GermaniJourno Trump says that we have gangs and most are illegal immigrants  #Debates2016
@Barbara102006 "The 2nd Amendment is for 'Real Americans' if you catch my drift." #debates
Our bridges, roads, and airports are bad because rich people like you don't pay taxes, DONALD. #Debates2016
"I made a mistake and if I was doing it again I would do it differently"- says everyone in prison.  #debatenight
Wait he just said that stop and frisk was a good thing and that it is constitutional??? Since whennnnn???? #debatenight
Shouting over other people is clearly the way to look professional. Thanks for the tip, Big D!! #DebateNight
I need my President to be more intelligent than me. Please America don't choose Orange Voldemort.#debates #ImWithHer
LIE: The Old Post Office is not next to the White House. #DebateNight #ImWithHer
Of course ICE is supporting the racist who wants to kick out Hispanics and Muslims. #Debates2016
Oh, shit, Hillary ties in the Michelle Obama speech.  Woot woot!  #debatenight
#DebateNight #Debates #Trump on #terror #terrorism: "We should have taken the oil." He adds it was #ISIS's "primary source of income."
Its like watching an out of control debate in highschool. As a former teacher, I feel sorry for the moderator. #debatenight
Hillary is too rehearsed. Hearing the same old thing. No real solutions. #debatenight
Uh oh.  Stop&amp;Frisk @HFA @HillaryClinton @TheBriefing2016 #Debates2016 Yes - let's recognize the present Mayor of NYC.
I'm trying 2 maintain my composure &amp; sanity so not watching #debates. Has either candidate mentioned our broken #Fostercare system? #Failure
"Can we just watch football?"  -My Wife who hates football #debatenight
I admire her self control. I'd be laughing maniacally at this trainwreck standing next to me. #debates
@realDonaldTrump "I've created great relationships with the African American community over the LAST LITTLE WHILE"  #debatenight
Looking forward to Hillary Clinton ceding the rest of her time to Donald Trump.  #debates
Donald froths at the mouth while blowing snot bubbles and angrily defending his self control calmness. Huge. #zen #debatenight
.@HillaryClinton: "broad based inclusive growth is what we need in America, not tax breaks for very top" #debates
"He didn't pay any income tax"   "That makes me smart" - Trump   Are you shitting me right now? No, I mean really. #Debates2016
"Our airports are like ones from 3rd world countries"   &gt;Dubai &gt;China  We maintain more than 3 airports you mongoloid. #Debates2016
he was so done he was like " you need to move on " #debatenight
Now would be the perfect time to talk about lack of #tribaljurisdiction to prosecute crimes on #sovereignland #debatenight
@HillaryClinton PLEEEASE go off script and tell us what we want to hear #debatenight @LesterHoltNBC
@realDonaldTrump said he's smart to not pay any taxes. It's smart to not pay your fair share. This man wants to be President #debatenight
Trump: "We have to bring back law and order." Translation: "Brown people, stop being so violent." #debatenight
Did he really just say he had a better temperament than @HillaryClinton. I can't right now. #Debates2016
Wow... Trump is a mess. How do people eat this up? #debatenight
Serious tweet:He's mad now. Imagine him representing your country and discussing politics with other world leaders. #debatenight
SHE JUST SNATCHED DONALD 😂 SHE'S P R E P A R E D #debatenight
These candidates non-talking faces say everything you need to know about these candidates. And it sucks. #debatenight
Trump is in the very same breath also lying. No seriously WTF why does America put up with this #debatenight
people say Hillary is too calm.. Are you listening to what Trump is saying ? How do you respond to that #Debates2016
Pander, pander...kiss the ass of everyone and give them nothing after you are elected HRC #debatenight
Moderator now Decides he's in the debate: Holt vs Donald.  #PresidentialDebateHaiku #debatenight
Hillary is accusing the whole country of racism right now. No Hillary! I am not a racist!  #tcot #debates

Two old white people trying to act concerned about black people smh #debatenight
She's copying his hand gestures. That means she feels subordinate  #Debates2016
I need that screencap of Hillary's face when Trump said he had a better temperament than she. #debates
Why are we all forced to watch a rabid 3rd grader engage in a "debate" with an adult? No offense to 3rd graders. #Debates
#debatenight I am ironing clothes in my bedroom...far away from a TV #PresidentialDebate
Presidential candidate admits to taking advantage of people and laws. Seems legit. #Debates2016
*cant stop thinking about the negative things that'd be said about Hillary if she was screeching the same way Trump is* #debatenight
@USATODAY  if this continues as the smear effort that both have started,  nothing will be learned by the end of the night! #debatenight
@nlahanas He has not a bigot, just because the Ku Klux Klan, runs your ground game and makes Robo calls for you...  Is that proof? #debates

NO MR TRUMP!! Not paying your fair share of taxes is NOT smart! Close the loopholes and pay your fair share! #debatewithbernie #debatenight
Update: city club of Cleveland cash bar has run out of alcohol 15 minutes in to this #Debates2016

"A man who can be provoked by a tweet should not have his hands anywhere near the nuclear codes." YEP #debates
THIS JUST IN: Trickle Down Economics doesn't work, manufacturing will never return to the USA. #debatenight
Trump's campaign is deleting tweets based on his responses during #debatenight Good god people stop supporting this fool.
Alright I'm done. I'd rather run my nuts through a cheese grater then watch this nonsense. We are doomed regardless. #debatenight
Why do the candidates always have to diss each other? Can't they just make a valid argument and hope that we support them. #debatenight
@DanLeach971 Didn't he have those sniffles at one of the other debates. Wait....is he hiding an illness?? How dare he.
trump is the first candidate to be endorsed by ICE because he's the first as candidate to be as racist as them  #debates
Stop and frisk is unconstitutional, pls just keep giving these cops more of a reason to be racist #debatenight
I feel like trump is trying to say we should take guns away from black people without saying those words? #debatenight
Yeeeessss!! Address the racism in the judicial system!!! Thank you Hillary!!! #Debates2016
maybe Trump should build (and pay for) a wall around the White House so that he can't break into it illegally from next door #debatenight
Here the Trump is mansplaining Hillary's thoughts on gun control to her. #debatenight
just get "RACIST" tattooed on your forehead and save us all some time @realDonaldTrump #debatenight

#debates Hillary starts a lie and Trump puts it to bed and he is the bad guy
"i have a much better temperament than she does"   *the audience LAUGHS* #DebateNight
Settling a lawsuit with no admission of guilt does not equate to not-guilty of said charge. #debatenight
"When they go low, we go high, and Barack Obama went high . . ."  Yes, Hillary! #debatenight
Why was it important to mention your son?? It literally held no importance to the question you were asked??? #debatenight
Worst SNL skit ever. Bring over Tina Fey &amp; Amy Poehler. #debates

Donald Trump calling for "law and order" is literally some of the scariest shit I've ever heard #debatenight #ImWithHer #blacklivesmatter
Tremendous, Amazing, Great, Huge, Unbelievable - can't use again w/out feeling #dirty. Thx #Trump for staying classy #debatenight #trumpmelt
Watching the #debates almost makes me feel sorry for the Americans. They can win my event this week 28-0 yet still come out losers this year
Watching the presidential debate is like watching 2 monkeys fling shit at each other #debatenight
HEAL DAT DIVIDE #DebateNight #trumpeduptrickledown #bigotedpolitics @realDonaldTrump thinks indiscriminate killing of blacks is "law &amp;order"
I wonder if Trump ever watched THE WEST WING  #debatenight  #Debates2016
@LesterHoltNBC hasn't asked Hillary for any clarification like he has to @realDonaldTrump  Media Bias alert! #debates
Calling BS on @HillaryClinton! Racism is all AMERICANS being brutalized but only African Americans being singled out as victims! #debates
OMG!!! Trump talking about people not paying their fair share after admitting to NOT paying his fair share!!!! HYPOCRITE!!! #debatenight
Good point, Sec. Clinton. Prejudice is a cultural inheritance we all share. Decent people strive to overcome it not justify it #debatenight
. @realDonaldTrump talks about #stopandfrisk/denies the unconstitutional ruling/talks his property v. HUMAN LIVES #debatenight #Election2016
Thank you thank you thank you. She affirms it's not just lawn &amp; order &amp; that racial profiling still exists! @HillaryClinton @HFA #debates
Trump thinks his temperament is better than Hillary's??? 😳😳😳😳😳 She isn't interrupting and calling Holt a liar. #Debates2016
Trump: "i have a much better temperament than her" Heads somewhere exploding #debatenight
Clinton has an obvious comeback one-liner here. Let's see if she takes it. #debatenight
Please watch the #Debates2016 with a socially conscious teen so you can keep a semblance of hope in the future.

#Debates2016 astonishing. He is an animated lie, right there in front of our very eyes. On the biggest stage in the world #birtherism
Dead @realDonaldTrump - What are you doing that you keep getting audited? #debatenight
Donald Trump doesn't care about black people.. smh ... #debatenight  y'all need to listen smh
I wish we didn't have to come to twitter for facts checking. Moderators &amp; networks need to do better. #debatenight
Thousands of what KIND of people, #DonaldTrump? Can't talk about race without naming it. #debatenight #BLM
All trump can cling to is emails. And his supporters are dumb enough to eat it up#debatenight
I'm losing the energy to comment on what this buffoon says because he's making the pars so easy. #debatenight
I've been to Trump Tower, the Starbucks is overpriced and the walls are tacky.. You ain't built shit. 💁🏼 #debatenight
He keeps talking for more than 2 minutes and it's damaging my ears. #ShutUpDrumpf #debatenight
DONALD TRUMP KEEP SNIFFLING SOMEONE CALL THE DOCTOR THE END IS NIGH #isthishowitworks #debatenight #ImWithHer
#Debates @realDonaldTrump when are you going to talk about #KKK? Now there's an endorsement.

THE BUDGET IS BAD BECAUSE "SUCCESSFUL" BUSINESS MEN DON'T PAY TAXES AND BRAG ABOUT IT. #Debates2016 #debatenight #debates
"The FED is doing political things."- @realDonaldTrump It's a central bank; it's sort of political. #debatenight
"China is totally powerful." - Trump, resisting the urge to say China is all that and a bag of chips #Debates2016
.@HillaryClinton just schooled Trump. Yes, she did prepare for debate. She also prepared to be President. *applause*  #debatenight
I pay more in federal income tax than Donald Trump and I've been unemployed for like half of this year #debatenight
Honestly Hillz is gonna lose this part bc she's gonna try to stay moderate on a subject where there are no moderates. #debatenight
I'm actually lol-ing at this ridiculous orange bafoon. Someone shut him up already. #debatenight #Debates2016
"The best thing by far is my temperament. I have a winning temperament."  😂😂😂 I can't even #debatenight
When are they gonna talk about the situation of the Nintendo NX? #debates
Trump says reports he initially supported the Iraq war are "mainstream media nonsense put out by [Clinton]." #DebateNight
trump is delirious  - best company? Internationally successful? This guy is high on himself  #Debates
we're still talking about the birth certificate? is that a good use of everyone time?  #debates
I think HRC's strategy of just letting him talk himself into his own grave is "tremendous" #debates
Trump, inner city residents don't report crimes as they know they will be searched &amp; some excuse will be made for them to be jailed #debates
Trump admonishing politicians for letting down African-americans... bet he won't mention not letting them rent his apartments. #debatenight
Vacuum was ultimately created by Bush in the middle-east. And as for NATO, the US gains by having a free Europe to trade with. #debatenight
"WRONG!""NOT!" If he yells "PSYCH!" I'm gonna hang up my keyboard and call it a night. #debatenight
His inability to not let her speak without some attempted snide job is just silly. #debatenight
Trump thinks a pullout date is what caused Isis?  Does he have any idea who Isis is?  #debatenight
That has bag just shouts "I'm right" when all the receipts show otherwise. Wtf #debatenight
Somebody bring this man a bucket please. He got dry mouth #debatenight
Proud of Hillary for transcending her instincts as a white woman to react with "I honestly can't even with you right now" #Debates2016
I misheard. I thought @realDonaldTrump just announced that he was endorsed by ISIS. #debates
Donald is just rehashing already released facts and saying law &amp; order over and over. Huh?? #debatenight
#Trump seems to be actively trying to lose the vote of every woman who has ever been talked over by men. So basically all of us. #debates
I will say this guy is doing a great job putting all of the fact proving on Clinton #debatenight
"@NATO should paid their fair share but I don't need to" - @realDonaldTrump #debatenight
Trump is more than a nut case and his only strategy is to disrupt Hillary while she is giving details policies. #Debates
What does Obamas birth certificate have to do with how "Trump" will led the nation &amp; defending  ISIS? #debatenight
Trump and Hillary aren't even trying to prove their not shitty anymore, they're just arguing who is less shitty at this point. #debatenight
He can't have an actual debate, even if his life depended on it. #debatenight
#HillaryClinton talking about African-American communities: "There's a lot we should be proud of." #Debates2016
#Braggadocious. Even though the sound of #Trump is really quite atrocious. If he says shit loud enough he really sounds precocious. #debates
I'm not sure what his 10 yo son being very good at computers has anything to do with cyber security. Maybe it's just me? #debatenight
My man Lester is just tryna get a word in but keeps getting interrupted #Debates2016 #PrayForLester
Endorsed by ICE? Well no shit, you started your campaign by condemning a whole ethnicity &amp; then a religion... #DumpTrump #debatenight
This man-child wants to be president. Let just let that sink in. President. What the fuck America? #debatenight
Apparently every country in the world is ripping off America. According to Donald Trump. Fuckin Bhutan at it again. #debatenight
It's pretty ballsy to bitch about US infrastructure at the same time you're bragging about being smart for not paying taxes. #debatenight
"my most winning asset is my temperament" ..i think his acid just kicked in. the dive off the deep end has begun  #Debates2016 #debatenight
Donald Trump is unfit to be President. Sorry you cant bully your way to the White House. #debatenight
Richie Rich: you're rubber and I'm glue, whatever you say bounces right off of me and sticks on you.   #debatenight
I'll say this for Trump, he's a hell of a tap dancer #debatenight #PresidentialDebate
This debate is pointless.  The best candidate wasn't allowed to attend #debatenight #Dayman4President
Trump: "The African american community has been let down by our politicians." #debatenight
Okay, looking around, I see Tetris, HuffPost article, someone signing up for Amazon Prime, WashPo fact checker &amp; Facebook #debatenight
Anybody else notice the emphasis he puts on African in African American? Nah? Ok... #debatenight #FuckTrump #NeverTrump
What do you say about racial healing?    I say nothing.  Omg.  #debatenight
Hillary just basically said twitter fingers could turn to nuclear trigger fingers 😂#DebateNight
Did she just point to Trump lowkey while saying "metal health issues." I love her  #debatenight
@HillaryClinton sounds ultra-robotic. hope the fact checkers are working over time on her.  #debatenight
#debatenight  Since the audience was told not to clap or cheer or theyll be removed, who's going to remove those cheering for Hillary?
#Debates HOW THE HELL IS DONALD TRUMP TALKING TO HILLARY ABOUT "HORRIBLE THINGS TO SAY."
I need @iamjohnoliver to do an hour long coverage of this presidential debate on #LastWeekTonight asap #debatenight
Hilary feels that the 500 murders in Chicago is not worth mentioning #Debates

This debate needs surprise guests, Julian Assange please jump in now #Debates2016

Yes, let's invest on the middle class! Cause this whole shrinking is killing us all. #Debates2016
like he's really arguing with the facilitator, he's tone when talking about Hilary is really demeaning. This guy is a psycho #debatenight
If Trump were a billionaire, his jacket wouldn't fit like shit. Puckering in the shoulder? Tsk Tsk. #Debates2016 #ImWithHer
god trump really misses law &amp; order.  what would happen to this country if we never had it #debatenight
Don't visit Trump's clubhouses, even he thinks they look like shit. #debatenight
Trump wants to cyber with you, so pull down your pants. #Trump #Clinton #DebateNight #Debates2016
Trump is gonna start talking about his hot, Canadian girlfriend that "you totally don't know"#Debates2016
"Let’s talk about building your businesses on the backs of little guys." Trump may jump across the podium now. #debatenight #Debates2016
Just like she can’t bring back jobs, she can’t produce-- Trump on the #Obama birth certificate issue LMAO.   #debatenight
I wonder when Trump is going to realize that He's on tape supporting he war. #debatenight
Hillary is so beyond him in her ability to maintain composure and provide intelligent, real responses. #debates #nocontest #ImWithHer
Shout out to #debatenight, the one day of the year kids on the debate team get to feel like people care.
This is devastating. HRC is slicing and dicing Trump. Stiffing the little guys?  #debates
Trump on water #5. Wait # 6!  Is he deathly ill? Dehydrated? #debatenight
What does Obama's birth certificate have to do with the future of this country? #debates
Stop and frisk- the randomized physical stop of suspectes social predators. Great so can I frisk a white cop? #debatenight @realDonaldTrump
I agree we should bring back Law and Order. SVU just isn't doing it for me anymore #Debates2016
For the record, I would not have paid @realDonaldTrump for services rendered in producing President Obama's birth certificate. #debatenight
My cat just accidentally muted the television while Trump was talking! Coincidence? I think not. #PresidentialDebate #Debates2016
We're down to the last 30, who needs a strong finish? #debatenight
Did Trump just say he's smart for not paying federal taxes. #debatenight
They're gonna have to start cutting Trump's mic if he can't wait his turn #debatenight
I'll vote for whoever promises to step down once in office. #debatenight
We need law and order to remove you from the stage #debatenight
Hillary just said "we have got to come up with a plan.."  Isn't that what you're here for? #debates
Apparently it's ok for Trump to interrupt, just not vice versa. Hold it, Hillary!!! #debatenight
#DebateNight  33,000 emails Hillary needs 2release her emails She is Crooked &amp; dishonest Hillary put Americans at RISK TRUMP NEVER DID THAT
#debatenight  Hillary is lying about birther issue She brought it up first She lies and lies and all talk and no action 30 years of practice
Trump openly proclaims that he has taken advantage laws that help companies and hurt people.  #DebateNight
There is a big fight right now for the black male vote. #debatenight
And how the crap do you plan on doing that @HillaryClinton?! Maybe just ask nicely-don't be too combative. 👮🏻#debatenight #guncontrol
oh yes, being in the company of racists minimizes Trumps culpability. okay, right #Debates
#debatenight take the oil, all of it? How can you take, in one shot all the oil in the oilfields of Iraq?
(I Don't know what the email thing is - what is it? ) #Hillary #debatenight
Trump claims to have a much better temperament than Clinton. Audience laughs. #debatenight
Is it a bad thing @HillaryClinton isn't wearing an American flag pin lapel? 😳 #wardrobemalfunction #Debates2016

If Clinton had been fighting ISIS her entire adult life, that would make her about 25 or 26. #debatenight
Oh America....do you long for the days of Sarah Palin thinking?  #debates
"I take advantage of the laws of the nation" in a Hillary ad in 3...2...  This is an ass-kicking, folks. She's crushing him. #debatenight
In this #debatenight .@HillaryClinton says that "I prepared to be President and that is a good thing."
I see a change in trump..... he looks less orange 󾁒 #Trump #Clinton #debatenight #Debates2016 #PresidentialDebate

I'm... this impromptu birther conversation, I can't. We have entered the Twilight Zone. #debatenight
@kemrichardson7 A winning temperament?!? I think he's on something besides his high horse #debates
Typical Hillary blaming guns instead of the criminals who misuse them. She'll grab every gun until #2A is meaningless. #DebateNight #Debates
I give 0 shits on how pretty a damn airport is... I want a way to get a pretty life #debatenight
Were all fucked 😂😂😂 god needs to flood this earth  #Debates
Yes, Donald Trump is shrill and not smiling plus he lies.  #debatenight
Very good point...why is Hillary telling ISIS how she plans to defeat them?! That's a disastrous plan. #debatenight
"They they they they" oh, and Obama... #debatenight Jesus I need another drink
#Debates2016 people say Trump is being paid to get Clinton elected, I think Hillary is being paid to get Trump elected.
#debatenight Hey Hillary - how about ending the disgraceful, expensive and racist War on Drugs??
THIS IS NOT A DEBATE.  DEBATES ARE TALKING ABOUT WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO DO FOR THE COUNTRY  NOT TRY TO SHOVE/DISPROVE LIES
If you use a non-secure server for emails yeah I would think you're going to get attacked by cyber attacks  #debatenight
And the birth certificate of our current president has relevance to the current race how?? #Debates2016
On #Race - "They have guns. And they shoot people."   ...On "Race"!! Not trying too hard to get elected, is he?   #debatenight
@attackerman it has to do with the googles machine and inter webs- very complicated. Move along. #Debates2016
How do you not have ring girls for this? Great opportunity missed. Also superbowl priced comercials that proceeds go to a charity. #debates
@GillianEllsay I prepared for this, I am prepared to be president - HC #StartFreshWithNewCandidates #debatenight

"I've broken up with people for interrupting me less times than this." -Erin #debatenight

#debatenight livestream does Hillary have any clue what she is talking about? 40 years, she should have learned the best lie by now
It is so interesting that Trump has no plans accept for that damn wall. #debatenight
The more he interrupts with pompous "wrong"s, the more I trust and respect him. For sure. /s #debatenight
So Hillary has been fighting ISIS her entire adult life and she was there when it was founded? He needs to stick with 1 story. #debatenight
ah I see, elect Trump and no more crime. How will he do it? Who cares! We don't need specifics. Donald has a secret plan. #debates #trump
Trump keeps interrupting with personal insults and non-factual accusations. I’ll win a lottery if he answers just one question. #Debates2016
“Russia Russia Russia The Cyber.” Add to that 400lb man in a bed with flobsweat. There’s your Trump foreign policy. #Debates2016
I blame #POTUS  for getting me and my family a bigger house my money has grown fuck u @realDonaldTrump  #Debates

Bravo to all of you watching the candidates during #debatenight through #Snapchat filters. Immature, but admittedly slightly hilarious
Sing it, Hills! Tell the long record of racist behavior.  #debatenight
Does the Donald only know what is going on in cities he has property??? #debatenight #Debates2016  @CNN @business
Trump's solution for racial divide is 2 words: "LAW and ORDER." Is there anyone who doesn't understand what that really means?  #debatenight
Hillary has no plan.  She's just trying to be anti-Trump.  All she does is lie. #debatenight #debates #ncschoolsdebate
People in inner cities want Dump speaking for them. Pathological liar, has never been outside own head, fabricates from there. #debatenight
Let me just say this, Monsoon, they don't want me up at the debate podium! I got stuff that would knock their socks off! #debatenight
Let's get rid of the politician and put in the business man, Donald Trump! #Debates2016
Obama off to the golf course ?? Fact checking and that should be basketball court 🏀 #debatenight
It's like we singled out the two worst people in America :/ #debatenight
"so many things that we have to do better... and certainly cyber is one of them" - trump, somehow not making a cybersex joke #debatenight
There should be someone who fact checks their statements and presses a buzzer whenever there's a false statement. #debatenight
Jill Stein removed after conducting an interview and not allowed near the debate? I'm not a Jill Stein fan but wtf? #debatenight
If I wasn't home sick I could be watching this in a bar getting wasted as I watch the future of this nation melt away. #debatenight
You know what, we do need law and order I love that show #debatenight
Trump should know first hand how many jobs are lost to China--he only manufactures his shirts, ties, and suits there. #debatenight
Clinton can hide her criminal Empire by media. Release  damn EMAILS. WHAT ARE YOU HIDING??? CRIMINAL?? #Debatenight #ClintonCriminalEmpire
Hillary is wiping the floor with Trump and she knows it! #Debates2016

Has @realDonaldTrump just suggested China to go to war with North Korea? #debatenight
@jennieeexox he keeps using that word... I don't think it means what he thinks it means... #Debates2016 #princessbride
A trash talker just stepped into the ring with a real hitter and she's taking some body blows. #debatenight #Debates2016
The same disrespect you show her when she's trying to talk? #Debates
What the hell is the weird sniffing thing he's doing? Now I'm wondering if a denture is loose? #debates #Debates2016 #twinja
#Trump bragging about filing bankruptcy, stiffing blue-collar workers, &amp; not paying taxes.  Wait, what?! #debatenight
I think I'm going to throw up! Are people seriously voting for @HillaryClinton #debatenight
Clinton's probably right about Trump's taxes, but much like her e-mails, neither one is really a domestic issue. #LoCoDebates #DebateNight
@mikeVcella have you noticed the Crip (Clinton) is wearing Red and the Blood (Trump) is wearing Blue... #ImConfused #debatenight
Moderator is doing a terrible job letting trump talk non stop #debatenight
@realDonaldTrump why show the faxes only if @HillaryClinton shows her emails? We need real solutions, no 33000 emails ...  #DebateNight
WOW, Trump sure sweats releasing those tax returns! I think they will show he doesn't donate to charities like he says!! #Debates2016 time
Wow, TRUMP IS A RACIST! He's not explained how he's going to HELP minority communities, onceAGAIN!! #debates
.@MJohnsonCTV the stuff he says is unbelievable, yet millions of people believe it! #Debates2016 #debatenight
Hillary out here swinging for the fences at all of these fastball insults that Trump is trying to come at her with. #debatenight
I don't think top down works in America (refers to it as Trumped up Trickle-Down) - #Clinton #debatenight
You've take business bankruptcy six times, lots of great business people haven't taken bankruptcy even once - #Clinton #debatenight
If we had taken the oil, and we should have, ISIS would never have been able to form #DonaldTrump #debatenight
We get it guys, you're watching the debates no need to put it on your stories
HRC's debate skills showing here: baiting Trump into the tax return rabbit hole AND sidestepping the email issue. #Debates2016

Is it possible this man will become the President of the United States? Is it really possible? THIS CAN'T BE LIFE. #debatenight
If you think Hillary is winning over people I beg to differ. Trump's WWE like takes will pump up people tired of politicians #debatenight
If Trump can be POTUS, I think I can be Santa. This seriously can't be happening. #debatenight #thisguyisnuts
what is trumps obsession with war crimes, does he realize international laws exist #debatenight
"I have much better judgment than she does. There's no question ... I also have a better temperament. . a winning temperament." #debatenight
Trump does know many things. but of middle east politics--esp #iran--he knows so little. so, so little. #debatenight
literally wtf is he talking about right now. why does he get to parse his own history like this tonight? #debatenight
You know what else I prepared for? I prepared to be president. #debates
Vacuum up the intelligence? Hmm, not sure I like the sounds of that, that’s not how we will win the cyber #DebateNight
Guys I've been drinking every time he said 'tremendous' and now I'm so hydrated. #debates
Damn it LESTER WE WERE ROOTING FOR YOU!! WE WERE ALL ROOTING FOR YOU !! #debatenight
#Debates   Haha, Trump promises to do all these things, yet is rendered utterly helpless by a "routine financial audit."
Trump's words are basically "Weh it's SO HARD TO BE A STRAIGHT WIRTE MAN." #debatenight
(Stop &amp; Frisk) Donald says: You're wrong.  Mod: It's racial profiling Donald says: these are baaaaaaaaad ppl *idiot* #debatenight
Donald says: I agree w/ u..ppl are protecting the 2nd amnd.. u brought up super predator..it was something terrible 2 say  #debates
Well maybe you because you haven't paid income tax for a lot of years. #bazinga #gethimHill #debatenight
Who in their right mind can follow that line of reasoning? #debatenight #birther #wordsoup
"We need law and order. If we don't have it, we don't have a country." Trump #debatenight #racerelations
I think #Trump would like to phone a friend. But he doesn't have any. #debatenight
Donald Trump is really demonstrating how terrible of a human being he is. It is amazing that he gets away with this. #debatenight
Which candidate is gonna use Tron laser technology to fight Russia? #debatenight
Trump is literally telling the world that he is a lying, cheating, tax dodging, asshole. How are people voting for him! #debatenight
@realDonaldTrump An educated person listens "you haven't paid your taxes in many years" and Bankrupt many times too #debatenight
Brag - a - docious ?! Exhausted and we're only 1/3 in #debatenight
We settled the suit with no admission of guilt.... Doesn't mean you're not guilty #Debates2016
SO glad they are bringing up race in America!! SO important anf needed to be brought up. #Debates2016
Just checked btw murder rates in NYC are in fact down despite @realDonaldTrump being a liar. @debates
This debate confirms that the two least qualified are running.  #debatenight
"I made a mistake using a private email server."  That's like a porn star saying, "I've had a little sex here and there."   #DebateNight
This debate is going to kill civic involvement for a generation or more.  #ThanksForNothing #Debates2016  #GiantMeteor2016
Do any of these candidates know what a teraflop is? I don't know either but let's find out if Xbox Scorpio is on their radar #debatenight
"We've got to address the systemic racism in our criminal justice system." -@HillaryClinton #debatenight
"Were he ever to get near the White House" AINT GONNA HAPPEN #debatenight debatenight
I FEEL EXTREMELY THREATENED AND AFRAID EVERY TIME HE SPEAKS. Her composure always amazes me. #debatenight
Criminal intent wasn't bad either RT @HenJoeSchmoe: Look I enjoy Law &amp; Order too but SVU is better.....#debatenight
Did @realDonaldTrump seriously just try to claim he did @BarackObama a favour by pushing birtherism??? Seriously!! #racist #debatenight
I can't get college financial aid without showing my tax returns. Donald Trump is trying to be president without showing his #debatenight
Those frequent naps are doing Lester a world of good.  #debates
#Trump doing a great job using generalities so far. he needs to be careful w/ it. #debates #debatenight #PresidentialDebate
If you're privileged to vote. Go vote. Save us.  Don't Underestimate the Power of Stupid People in Large Groups.-George Carlin. #DebateNight
Did Hillary just admit that she is racist/prejudice? I guess everyone missed that. She is afraid of her super predators. #debatenight
We've heard about properties in New York, D.C., Charlotte, Chicago...we get it Trump!! You love to play Monopoly. #Debates2016
oh dear lord, what is trump going to say about race #debatenight
#NewDrinkingGame: take a shot every time the Donald says he has an investment in said city or endorsed by certain association #debatenight
Still can't figure out what Trump is going for with that brutal haircut #Debates
If you say @seanhannity 10 times fast does he appear in the mirror? #debatenight
@sbterry247 no. But they won't let any of the others participate in debates. We have to change that
The US ran a fucking surplus when Bill Clinton was president. #Debates2016
Trump has a bunch of money but can't buy cold medicine apparently #debatenight
"We weren't the only ones sued." Maybe so but we're talking about YOU being sued. Sooooo... #debatenight
We talk about foreign terrorist threats but continue to ignore domestic terrorism aka #LawEnforcement  #debatenight
Trump let out an audible groan when Hillary said "Black Communities." Sheesh put your racism away for 2minutes dickhead. #debates
.#debates @realDonaldTrump's showing his lack of temperament...I wonder who it was that warned us that this might happen?
.#debates Trump just gave a 5 minute promo of his building.  Still no plans!
.#debatenight He's actually proud because he made our first African American President "show us his papers". He's pathetic.
Trump told us he has the temperament to be president..  While basically shouting at us.   #debatenight
Clinton: maybe Donald Trump hasn't paid any federal income tax at all. Trump: THAT MAKES ME SMART. Whaaaaaa? #debatenight
Back in my day, "Doing Cyber" meant something completely different, Mr. Trump #debatenight
The presidential candidates don't care that much about what's going on with the people of color #debatenight.
Hahaha the fact that Trump said his biggest strength is his temperament 😂😂😂😂😂😂 #debatenight
Trump calls for greater law and order measures to resolve racial inequality :( #debates
Oh forfuckssakes Lester. Nobody gives a shit about the birth certificate. Bigger fish to fry here. Veterans. Terror. #debatenight
Unequivocal proof that trump is delusional: he has delusions his temperament is better than Clinton's.  argument over #debatenight
Trump is bragging again, about his club?? And also not admitting he's guilty? What a president he'd make. :P #Debates2016
@realDonaldTrump was winning at the beginning. Honestly. But with that meltdown, there's no coming back from that. #debatenight
There are more countries in the world than China, Russia, and 'Merica - there's also the State of Chaos where this debate lives #DebateNight
Thoughts about #debatenight, I don't like either. However, I hate Hillary more. Not that any of this matters. 👍🏼
While you're talking about my president who has been in office for 8 years, is your wife a legal citizen? 🤔 #debatenight
I wonder how many medics and ambulances are on standby for the drinking game that's happening during #debatenight #Debates2016
Out tweets can be shown on TV???? Wow!!!!! Hi mom!!!!! And dad!!!! And William!!!! #Debates
I think a raccoon would have done better at this debate than Trump....and they are sneaky... #Debates2016
If you want to find out who the racists are, just get on social media during the presidential debates. You'll find out really quickly.
TRUMP JUST SAID HES ENDORSED BY ISIS ARE YOU FUCKING KIDDING ME?! #Debates
Clinton: U can't just say law &amp; order, u have 2 have a plan. Drops mic. #prisonreform #criminaljusticesystemoverhaul #debatenight #ImWithHer
Oh here we go, "He knows a lot of people", I'm so fucking tired of hearing him say that. #debates #debatenight
@#debatenight The vacuousness of Trump speech should be alarming to viewers. He can repeat the same thing 3 times  yet say nothing at all.
This would be as entertaining if you turned off the sound and just watched Trump's facial expressions #Debates2016 #debatenight
"I think by the end of the night, I will be blamed for everything."-Clinton #Debates2016
Clinton says implicit bias isn't just as issue with cops, but with everyone and we should all ask why we feel the way we do. #Debates2016
That clip was just wrong then. Here comes the media blaming. #debatenight
Donald, Donald… you’re using Sean Hannity as your reference. Just go to bed. #debatenight
The only problem with making college debt free is that money owed to universities, will come from somewhere else. #debatenight #WTNM
I'll donate $100 to @HillaryClinton tonight if she calls @realDonaldTrump out on his #misogyny tonight. #debatenight #letherspeak
Trump disagreeing with Lester about stop and frisk being unconstitutional in New York, arguing that it is still there #Debates2016
I'm done this is a joke. We had better debates in my college class😌
Hillary just ignored all of Trump's random shit and went straight to the topics 👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽 #debatenight
This is the guy who's going to stop war and seek peace on earth. Out of control bully?  Really people? !! #debatenight
Remember in Clueless when Cher "wins" the debate without actually debating/making any sense? Don't be Clueless, America. Plz. #DebateNight
Ok, trump is ADMITTING he paid money to end a lawsuit for refusing to rent to black renters. #debates
"Alexander Hamilton once said 'I'm not throwing away my shot.'"-Donald Trump #debatenight
"Sean Hannity has been riding my D for the past 6 months" #FACTS #debatenight
If you have the urge to drink? Take a tall glass of shut the fuck up. Trumps secret to not talking. #trump #trickster #debatenight
How does one filter the #debatenight hashtag out of their TL? Asking for myself.
It's scary that ISIS has expanded into 30 countries. It will only get worse if Hillary gets in office. #debates
If you sanctioned Iran, Mrs. Clinton, how did they end up with nuclear weapons, huh?  #debates
@HillaryClinton you're worried about @realDonaldTrump releasing his tax returns when you won't release the emails?!?? What?! #debatenight
#DonaldTrump just referred to #Obama as "your president" @HillaryClinton - as if he ain't his. #Debates2016
If you're gonna believe CNN's "fact check" after this you're a moron #debatenight #debates
Damn I wish that 3 or 6 or 3 answer would have worked in my math class #Debates2016
Trump: "You need to take the guns away from the people, the bad people..." #Debates2016 Who are those "bad people" @realDonaldTrump?
Is this the Man Americans want to trust with Nuclear codes? Such crooked fellow who admits to non-payment of Federal Income Tax #debatenight
#DDOS attack on Trump's website...same IP address as Clinton's old email server #Debates2016
, @LesterHoltNBC they need to turn @realDonaldTrump mic when it's not his turn. #debatenight
Being endorsed by the fraternal police order probably isn't something I'd be bragging about #debates
I'm very biased but Hilary doing loads better than expected (I think) and The Donald looking well flustered  #debatenight
#debatenight drink every time Trump says 'believe me' - ya already drunk
Did #DonaldTrump just say not paying taxes for years makes him smart! 😂😂😂😂😂  #debatenight and you want to be president? MF!!! #Debates2016
We should do a shot every time Trump says "Believe me" #debatenight
HILLARY YES!!! Way to be an adult when forced to argue with a child. #debatenight #ImWithHer
Wow... This is almost too much to keep watching. #Debates #debate2016 #Trump  he's apparently good at relationships. 😂
Hey, I found @LesterHoltNBC! He was hiding behind Trump's opposition to the Iraq War! #debates
If anyone's ignoring the two-minute rule more, it's definitely the Don. Terrible. #Debates2016
@HillaryClinton: "What I have proposed would cut regulations and streamline them for small businesses." #debatenight
'we're in a big, fat, ugly bubble right now' @realDonaldTrump and warns of consequences when the Fed raises interest rates on #debatenight
"I made a mistake using a private email," @HillaryClinton asked about emails by @realDonaldTrump, who says "That's for sure!" #debatenight
@HillaryClinton: "I'm certainly relieved that my late father never did business with you." #debatenight
'we have to knock the hell out of ISIS' in response to questions about security and Middle East #debatenight
donald and his 3rd grade vocab: "very" "terrible" "a lot" "people" "sniff" #Debates

Hillary has been such a disaster in foreign policy, we wouldn’t have isis problem, immigration problem, Libya, Its all a MESS #debatenight
Don wanted Hilary to come out shooting from the hip 😂😂😂 #Debates
Hillary is killin' it but I'm still sad my babe Gary Johnson didn't get to join the debate tonight 😢 #LetGaryDebate #debatenight
Hillary should not go down the road of "what is he hiding"?  She hides everything! #debatenight
✅ mentioned 400 lb. hackers ✅ proved 10 year old son is good at the cyber ✅ cleared throat drainage   Sorry folks, Trump won #debatenight
Clinton's talking hopes and plans and ideas, and Drumpf is just complaining and interrupting. #childish #nothelpingyourcase #Debates2016
Huh. I never noticed how shrill and combative @realDonaldTrump's voice is. And he should really try to smile more. #debates
Did he just make up a number right there, in plain sight? Yup, I believe he did. #debatenight
Trump just equated immigrants with murderers again and then somehow connected them to inner city violence #debatenight
I also think Trump forgets that, once something is out there, he can't make it go away. This isn't the 80s. #debatenight
"SHOW ME THE TAXES!" "SHOW ME THE E-MAILS!" "SHOW ME THE MONEY!" #Debates
Now we are going to send China to deal with North Korea? #OOF #debates #Debates2016 #debatenight
#Debates2016 Trump says we need law and order, African Americans and Hispanics live in hell, 4000 people killed in Chicago.
'Our friends in the Middle- East' says hillary unaware they would hang the entire LGBT community #debatenight
This is so uncomfortable. I feel like I'm at a friends house and their parents are arguing. #debates #debatenight
HRC "Trump is trying to hide the truth"  She is speaking from experience. #debates
Can someone teach #DonaldTrump how to quantify things properly, "tremendous" and "great number" are not units of measurements #debatenight
"We've got to address the systemic racism in our criminal justice system." - @HillaryClinton #Debates2016
Oh, good, #Trump wants to be another law and order president, as if anyone outside his family can afford another term of that. #debatenight
Does anyone else feel like @realDonaldTrump lowkey wants nuclear war? This is unsettling... #debatenight
Looks like Trump has been leaning about Law &amp; Order from Netflix. #debatenight
Trump rightly called out the DNC on their handling of Bernie. Ironically, the RNC created their own monster with Trump. #debatenight
